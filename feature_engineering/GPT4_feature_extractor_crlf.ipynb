    "UTTERANCE: \"{utterance}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "FRAZIER Score:\n",
    "- Frazier score measures the cognitive load of processing a sentence based on its syntactic structure. A high Frazier score indicates a more complex syntactic structure.\n",
    "- Low Frazier Score Example: \"This 'if' can be done more elegantly with Min(x,y)\"\n",
    "- High Frazier Score Example: \"Please see this warning about adding things to NavigationEntry.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "YNGVE Score:\n",
    "- Yngve score is another measure of syntactic complexity, complementary to Frazier score. It quantifies the cognitive load of processing a sentence based on its constituent parse tree. A high Yngve score suggests higher complexity.\n",
    "- Low Yngve Score Example: \"The description is a little confusing.\"\n",
    "- High Yngve Score Example: \"The only time we call one but not the other is in the destructor, when we don't need to call needsNewGenID, but setting two fields needlessly might be a low price to pay to ensure we never accidentally call one without the other.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Propositional Density:\n",
    "- Propositional density is the ratio of propositions (i.e., distinct assertions or ideas) to the total number of words in the comment. It measures information content.\n",
    "- Low Propositional Density Example: \"In addition to what I suggested earlier about testing for the non-existence of a third file, we could also verify that the contents of the sync database files are not nonsense.\"\n",
    "- High Propositional Density Example: \"I tried patching this in locally and it doesn't compile.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Content Density:\n",
    "- Content density is the ratio of open-class words (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) to closed-class words (e.g., pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions). It is another measure of information content.\n",
    "- Low Content Density Example: \"Slight reordering: please put system modules first, then a blank line, then local ones (PRESUBMIT).\"\n",
    "- High Content Density Example: \"Please check that given user id is child user, not currently active user is child.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Formality:\n",
    "- Formality assesses whether the language used in the comment is formal or informal.\n",
    "- Low Formality Example: \"But yeah, I'm just being an API astronaut*; I think that what I wrote up there is neat, but after sleeping, don't worry about it; it's too much work to go and rewrite stuff.\"\n",
    "- High Formality Example: \"Moving this elsewhere would also keep this module focused on handling the content settings / heuristics for banners, which is what it was originally intended for.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Politeness:\n",
    "- Politeness measures the degree of respect and courtesy expressed in the comment.\n",
    "- Low Politeness Example: \"You don't actually manage the deopt table's VirtualMemory, so you shouldn't act like you do.\"\n",
    "- High Politeness Example: \"Thanks for writing this test, getting there, but I think you could do this in a more principled way.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment:\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis determines the overall emotional tone of the comment.\n",
    "- Negative Sentiment Example: \"That's not good use of inheritance.\"\n",
    "- Neutral Sentiment Example: \"Are we planning on making use of this other places?\"\n",
    "- Positive Sentiment Example: \"It looks slightly magical.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty Type:\n",
    "- Uncertainty type identifies the specific type of uncertainty expressed in the comment, if any.\n",
    "- Epistemic Uncertainty Example: \"This seems a bit fragile.\"\n",
    "- Doxastic Uncertainty Example: \"I assume we added this notification purely for testing purposes?\"\n",
    "- Investigative Uncertainty Example: \"Did you check whether it was needed?\"\n",
    "- Conditional Uncertainty Example: \"Another possible option, if it does not cause user confusion, would be to automatically select those projects in the Files view when the dialog closes.\"\n",

While its development may not have been confirmed by LucasArts, several involved developers have since confirmed its development and cancellation. Coverage of its development and cancellation has been substantial. I don't think [[WP:CRYSTAL]] necessarily applies - the article isn't suggesting a product might be released in the future, nor is it speculating on what the product's features might be.

There are dozens that are [[Wikipedia:Featured_lists#Sports_and_recreation|featured lists]], and I'm at a loss as to what you think is different about this list that it should be deleted. Calling this OR makes zero sense because it's obviously verifiable who played for this team and when, and it's completely standard to limit lists of people to only those who merit articles (i.e., are [[WP:N|notable]]; though wouldn't all players for this team satisfy [[WP:NFOOTY]] and all be notable anyway?). Easily satisfies [[WP:LISTPURP]], plus complementary to [[:Category:FC Seoul players]] per [[WP:CLN]]. '''\"\n",

      "- Low Frazier Score Example: \"This 'if' can be done more elegantly with Min(x,y)\"\n",
      "- High Frazier Score Example: \"Please see this warning about adding things to NavigationEntry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "YNGVE Score:\n",
      "- Yngve score is another measure of syntactic complexity, complementary to Frazier score. It quantifies the cognitive load of processing a sentence based on its constituent parse tree. A high Yngve score suggests higher complexity.\n",
      "- Low Yngve Score Example: \"The description is a little confusing.\"\n",
      "- High Yngve Score Example: \"The only time we call one but not the other is in the destructor, when we don't need to call needsNewGenID, but setting two fields needlessly might be a low price to pay to ensure we never accidentally call one without the other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Propositional Density:\n",
      "- Propositional density is the ratio of propositions (i.e., distinct assertions or ideas) to the total number of words in the comment. It measures information content.\n",
      "- Low Propositional Density Example: \"In addition to what I suggested earlier about testing for the non-existence of a third file, we could also verify that the contents of the sync database files are not nonsense.\"\n",
      "- High Propositional Density Example: \"I tried patching this in locally and it doesn't compile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Content Density:\n",
      "- Content density is the ratio of open-class words (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) to closed-class words (e.g., pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions). It is another measure of information content.\n",
      "- Low Content Density Example: \"Slight reordering: please put system modules first, then a blank line, then local ones (PRESUBMIT).\"\n",
      "- High Content Density Example: \"Please check that given user id is child user, not currently active user is child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Formality:\n",
      "- Formality assesses whether the language used in the comment is formal or informal.\n",
      "- Low Formality Example: \"But yeah, I'm just being an API astronaut*; I think that what I wrote up there is neat, but after sleeping, don't worry about it; it's too much work to go and rewrite stuff.\"\n",
      "- High Formality Example: \"Moving this elsewhere would also keep this module focused on handling the content settings / heuristics for banners, which is what it was originally intended for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Politeness:\n",
      "- Politeness measures the degree of respect and courtesy expressed in the comment.\n",
      "- Low Politeness Example: \"You don't actually manage the deopt table's VirtualMemory, so you shouldn't act like you do.\"\n",
      "- High Politeness Example: \"Thanks for writing this test, getting there, but I think you could do this in a more principled way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentiment:\n",
      "- Sentiment analysis determines the overall emotional tone of the comment.\n",
      "- Negative Sentiment Example: \"That's not good use of inheritance.\"\n",
      "- Neutral Sentiment Example: \"Are we planning on making use of this other places?\"\n",
      "- Positive Sentiment Example: \"It looks slightly magical.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncertainty Type:\n",
      "- Uncertainty type identifies the specific type of uncertainty expressed in the comment, if any.\n",
      "- Epistemic Uncertainty Example: \"This seems a bit fragile.\"\n",
      "- Doxastic Uncertainty Example: \"I assume we added this notification purely for testing purposes?\"\n",
      "- Investigative Uncertainty Example: \"Did you check whether it was needed?\"\n",
      "- Conditional Uncertainty Example: \"Another possible option, if it does not cause user confusion, would be to automatically select those projects in the Files view when the dialog closes.\"\n",
      "\n",
