I have removed the section  Noncombatant because ""noncombatant"" means those who are in a war zone but are not combatants. The majority of those events listed in this section were not for deaths related to war. Those that were are already listed in the section ""Wars and armed conflicts"". If someone wants to create two columns under ""Wars and armed conflicts"". One for '''combatants''' and the other for '''non-combatants'', then all well and good. But the current division into two lists make no sense when the totals entries differ and overlap.

Noncombatants

<user_id=PBS>
this edit by an IP address reintroduced the noncombatants section without a comment in the history or on this talk page. I am deleting the section again for the same reasons as given above.

<user_id=Gatoclass>
Dictionary definitions of ""noncombatant"" differ - webster's just defines it as ""one who does not engage in combat"". Seems an appropriate enough title to me.

<user_id=PBS>
non combatant explains what a non combatant is. It has a specific meaning under international law. There are two obvious examples in the list but the rest are not non-combatant killings.

<user_id=Gatoclass>
Who says we have to use the definition given by the Geneva Conventions? Seems to me we are perfectly entitled to employ the term in its common, dictionary sense.

<user_id=PBS>
Oxford English Dictionary ""non-combatant, n. and adj.""
A. n.    A person who is not a combatant, as a civilian during a war; spec. a member of the armed services whose duties do not include active fighting, as a surgeon, purser, or chaplain, etc. Also in extended use.
B. adj.    Not involved in fighting; of, belonging to, or characteristic of a non-combatant.
It seems that The dictionary definition is the same as that of International law.

<user_id=Gatoclass>
Okay, well how about we call it ""Civilians"" or ""Civilians and non-combatants"" instead?

<user_id=PBS>
Gatoclass, I really don't understand your motives over this article, the title is List of wars and disasters by death toll what exactly is this section meant to cover because it is not at all clear at the moment?
If it was a list of wars by non-combatant deaths then that would be a coherent title. The trouble would be that in most wars although fairly reliable numbers are kept on military casualties they are not kept on civilians. The British numbers for civilian casualties in World War II are the exception not the rule (even the Germans who are know for keeping accurate records do not have them for World War II). One of the problems is that if one is working with raw population statistics (if they are available) it is necessary to extrapolate the number of dead over and above those that would have died within a population if no war had taken place. The means that most estimates are very rough and ready and open to misinterpretation, so any list of civilian war dead is likely to have such ranges as to be next to useless as a meaningful list.
It seems to me better to have just one ""Wars and armed conflicts"" with four columns to cover max and min for combatants and non-combatants and junk this section unless you can suggest what this section is meant to be listing so that a NPOV list can be created.

<user_id=Gatoclass>
This is not a page about ""wars and armed conflicts"", it's a page about large death tolls brought about by human agency, and as such is a complement to the page about large death tolls from natural disasters. Wars are clearly not the only method by which human beings have inflicted mass death on populations, that is why we have a number of sections to cover the different areas. I'm fine with tweaking section headers and/or section summaries where necessary, but I see no reason whatever for deleting entire sections, almost all the entries here list very well documented mass deaths inflicted by human beings, the issue of how best to label or organize them does not detract from their relevance to the overall topic.

<user_id=PBS>
You still have not suggested what this section is meant to be listing. That is needed if it is not to be a indiscriminate list.

<user_id=Gatoclass>
I've just given you a couple of explanations and alternatives, how can you say I've made no suggestions?

<user_id=Gatoclass>
The section basically lists significant death tolls inflicted on civilian populations. That seems pretty straightforward to me. I've already suggested that we rename the section either ""Civilian death tolls"" or ""Civilian and non-combatant death tolls"" but you haven't responded to those suggestions.

<user_id=PBS>
I thought we had already set aside armed conflict as a category, so they can not be civilian death tolls (OED ""A non-military man or official."")

<user_id=PBS>
,

<user_id=Gatoclass>
Sorry, I don't follow, what do you mean by ""we had already set aside armed conflict as a category""?

<user_id=PBS>
We already have a section for armed conflict and most of the rat-bag of entries here have little to do with armed conflict (those that do would be better served in the war section which includes both combatant and non-combatant totals).

<user_id=Gatoclass>
Well if they have ""little to do with armed conflict"", all the more reason to have them in this section! That's what it's for - civilian death tolls exclusive of collateral damage from battle.

<user_id=PBS>
Civilians killed in battle are still civilians (although they may or may not be non-combatants). I am removing this section again as there has been no progress to defining what it is and the vast majority of entries have nothing to do with war.

<user_id=Propatriamori>
This articles title is `List of war and ""disaters"" by death tolls`,so I think there is no problem even that this section nothhing connection to war.
If you don`t like this sections name `Non-combattant` changing sections name is better than delete it.

<user_id=PBS>
A list must have some form of structure that defines it. This particular section does not have any form of definition it is just a collection of facts.  For example what are the criteria links the slave trade, the deths of Leopold's congo and the Irish Potato Famine, and  228 Incident, it certainly isn't non-combattant deaths.

<user_id=PBS>
Removed section now titled Civilian as many of the entries are not ""campaigns""  and  ""civilians or noncombatants"" implies war, yet many of the entries have nothing to do with war.  This particular section does not have any form of definition it is just a collection of facts.  For example what are the criteria links the slave trade, the deths of Leopold's congo and the Irish Potato Famine, and  228 Incident, it certainly isn't non-combattant deaths.

<user_id=PBS>
The new title is not much better than the old one because under such a definition any killing of more than three people could be described as a mass killing and be included in the list. Mass killings are not necessarily either war or a disaster.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Clarity of Definitions**: The initial argument by PBS centers on the clarity and appropriateness of the term ""Noncombatant"" in the context of a list that includes deaths not related to war. PBS argues that the term has a specific meaning under international law and that the majority of events listed do not fit this definition. This is a strong argument because it emphasizes the importance of precise terminology in categorization.

2. **Alternative Suggestions**: Gatoclass suggests using the term in its common dictionary sense and later proposes alternative section titles like ""Civilians"" or ""Civilians and non-combatants."" This shows a willingness to find a middle ground and adapt the section to better fit its contents. However, the suggestion is somewhat weakened by the lack of a clear definition of what should be included in the section.

3. **Scope of the Section**: PBS points out that the section lacks a clear definition and seems to be an indiscriminate collection of facts. This is a valid concern as it questions the coherence and purpose of the section, which is crucial for a well-structured list.

4. **Relevance to the Article's Title**: Gatoclass argues that the page is about large death tolls brought about by human agency, not just wars and armed conflicts. This broadens the scope of the article and justifies the inclusion of various events. However, this argument is somewhat weakened by the lack of a clear criterion for inclusion in the section.

5. **Consistency with Existing Categories**: PBS argues that since there is already a section for armed conflict, the entries in question should either fit there or not be included if they do not relate to war. This argument emphasizes the need for consistency and relevance within the article's structure.

6. **Progress Towards Resolution**: Throughout the discussion, there is a back-and-forth with suggestions and rejections, but little progress is made towards a consensus on what the section should contain or be titled. This indicates a lack of effective resolution strategy in the discussion.

7. **Focus on Definitions and Criteria**: PBS consistently pushes for a clear definition and criteria for the section, which is a strong argumentative strategy to ensure the list's coherence and relevance.

Overall, the discussion shows an engagement with the topic and a genuine attempt to clarify and improve the article. However, the lack of consensus and clear criteria for the section in question indicates that the discussion could benefit from more structured argumentation and problem-solving strategies.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5
"<user_id=LahiruG>
State terrorism

<user_id=LahiruG>
I have removed a part of the recently added section on State Terrorism (given below) from the article, because there is no need to elaborate on State Terrorism in Sri Lanka here, as there is a separate page named Sri Lanka and state terrorism in Wikipedia to cover the topic.

<user_id=LahiruG>
The Sri Lankan government and the Sri Lankan Armed Forces have been charged with massacres, indiscriminate shelling and bombing, extrajudicial killings, rape, torture, disappearance, arbitrary detention, forced displacement and economic blockade. According to Amnesty International state terror was institutionalized into Sri Lanka's laws, government and society.

<user_id=Obi2canibe>
There are numerous articles which deal with LTTE & JVP terrorism (e.g. Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam; List of attacks attributed to the LTTE; List of attacks attributed to the LTTE, 1970s; List of attacks attributed to the LTTE, 1980s; List of attacks attributed to the LTTE, 1990s; List of attacks attributed to the LTTE, 2000s; List of people assassinated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam; Suicide bombings in Sri Lanka; Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna; 1971 JVP Insurrection; 1987–89 JVP Insurrection; List of people assassinated by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna; List of assassinations of the Second JVP Insurrection; etc). So why don't you summarise their terrorism into one sentence on this article? It seems you are applying double standards here - one for terrorism which you support (Sri Lankan state terrorism) and another for which you don't (LTTE terrorism and JVP terrorism).

<user_id=LahiruG>
Please use the page Sri Lanka and state terrorism to elaborate on state terrorism, rather than do it here. If you continue to violate NPOV policy I will report you at the Wikipedia:ANI.

<user_id=Obi2canibe>
I'm afraid it is you who is in violation of WP:NPOV because of your vehement opposition to including even a two sentence paragraph on terrorism you approve of (state terrorism) but you are more than happy to repeat extensive content from other articles (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, 1987–89 JVP Insurrection, Prevention of Terrorism Act (Sri Lanka)) on terrorism you disapprove of. So please go ahead with your threat to report me to ANI. We'll see if you are man enough to follow up your threats or if you're a typical WP:BULLY - all talk and no show.

<user_id=LahiruG>
First of all, I should tell you that I am just a neutral Sri Lankan wikipedian, like many others, who do not accept any kind of terrorism (whether it is state or non-state). But it seems like there are certain wikipedians who accept terrorism of specific groups they love, admire and sympathize. It is not me who is vehemently trying delete and remove pages/content which exposes the crimes of terrorist groups here. Due to POV editing, presently the coverage of Sri Lankan war related articles are very unbalanced and what I am trying to do here is to balance the things. If you can point out the policies or guidelines you follow to add state terrorism in to this page,I can follow it and balance the things with NPOV editing by elaborating on '''terrorism in Sri Lanka''' in the page Sri Lanka and state terrorism.

<user_id=LahiruG>
I am not the bully who reverts the edits of all the new Sri Lankan wikipedians due to the fear of their  potential threat to challenge your POV editing. You fear the newbies and revert even their good edits to discourage them and I have evidence. I just gave you a warning and if you continue with your unacceptable bullish behaviour I will definitely report you, when the correct time arrives. Don't forget that Wikipedians who has done hundred thousands of contributions also get blocked if they do not adhere to the policies in Wikipedia.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Argument about relevance**: User LahiruG argues that the section on State Terrorism in Sri Lanka should be removed from the article because there is a separate page dedicated to that topic. This is a valid point if the intention is to avoid content duplication and maintain focus within the article.

2. **Counter-argument about consistency**: User Obi2canibe counters by pointing out that there are numerous articles detailing terrorism by the LTTE & JVP, suggesting that if those are elaborated upon, then state terrorism should also be summarized in the article for balance. This is a reasonable argument if the goal is to ensure that all forms of terrorism related to Sri Lanka are represented equally.

3. **Accusation of bias and double standards**: User Obi2canibe accuses User LahiruG of applying double standards by being willing to include detailed information about LTTE and JVP terrorism but not state terrorism. This is a more confrontational approach and shifts the discussion from content relevance to personal bias, which is less constructive.

4. **Appeal to policies and guidelines**: User LahiruG asks for policies or guidelines to justify the inclusion of state terrorism in the article, which is a constructive approach as it seeks to ground the discussion in Wikipedia's rules and standards.

5. **Accusation of bullying and threats**: Both users accuse each other of bullying and make threats about reporting to Wikipedia:ANI. This is not constructive as it moves away from discussing the content and focuses on personal conflict.

6. **Neutral stance and balancing content**: User LahiruG claims to be a neutral editor seeking to balance content according to NPOV (Neutral Point of View) policy. This is a constructive stance if genuinely applied to editing practices.

Overall, the discussion starts with a focus on content relevance and policy but devolves into personal accusations and threats. The initial arguments about content relevance and consistency are valid and contribute to the quality of the discussion. However, the latter part of the exchange, which includes personal attacks and threats, detracts from the overall quality.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5
"<user_id=Usergreatpower>
I have restored to examples that were removed. There is no reason why this article shouldn't have any examples other than a gallery at the bottom of the article.

<user_id=Usergreatpower>
Examples

<user_id=Wikiscribe>
there is no reason there should be anymore pics in this artcile its an enyclopedia article not a picture book
there are maybe 30 pics in the gallery already to give a broad spectrum of examples

<user_id=Usergreatpower>
Well you may want to go check some other articles then because I see plently of photos on other articles.

<user_id=Usergreatpower>
There is no reason why 2 example photos should not be included in 2 relevent sections on this article.

<user_id=Usergreatpower>
Can you explain why the Black people article has example photos in relevent sections through the article or why articles such as the United States have pictures through the article instead of just a gallery at the end if Wikipedia isn't supposed to be a 'picture book' as you put it?

<user_id=Usergreatpower>
I was told to gain consensus before editing this article yet I am the only one using this talk page. Consensus is merely an excuse for blocking edits, as the people reverting edits state gain consensus first and won't attempt to build any consensus as they won't use the talk page while the article is their version, only if they are trying to put it back to their version. I also feel these reverst are racially motivated judging by the editors contributions histories. I will take this to the Admin notice board as I feel there is a racist few here restricting improvement of this article.

<user_id=Ramdrake>
First of all, it would be nice if you actually ''gave'' people time to reply, say a day or two at a minimum, rather than minutes. The sunbject of the pictures has actually been raised more than once on the talk page and the associated archive. In every case, it was decided by consensus not to have images in the article. For the record, I still think it's a bad idea: we already have the image gallery whih does just that. And please spare us the epithets: I would think just the scope of the gallery should demonstrate that no one here is racist.

<user_id=Usergreatpower>
However I think it's very poor that I need to take it to the Admins noticeboard to get any response. People seem to have the idea that this is their article and their say goes and any attempt by an outsider to change it from their preference will be responded to with reverts and these outsiders do not deserve any discussion.

<user_id=Wikiscribe>
Just for the record of consenus building i am against adding anymore pics whether it is to the gallery or to random parts of the article also just to let you know the black people article had no gallery for the longest time whilst this article had a gallery , this is not a compeition of dueling articles because one has the other should as well that is ridiclous

<user_id=Usergreatpower>
So here's the main point, is a photo of Marylin Monroe in the Physical appearance section a good or bad idea? I feel it's a good idea because she's probably the most iconic example of an idealised appearance of a white person.

<user_id=Wikiscribe>
okay thats fine lets give it a few days and see what some other editors think

<user_id=Ramdrake>
Previous consensus was against the inclusion of a sterotypical ""white"" person. I still think the gallery is enough.

<user_id=Wobble>
I'd like to know why Marylin Monroe is supposed to be ""the most iconic example of an idealised appearance of a white person."" Personally I think that no man wants to look like her, whether they are ""white"" or otherwise, so at the very least she could only represent an idealised version of a woman. Then there's the question of her obviously non-natural hair, and the fact that most so called ""white"" people are not blonde anyway. I don't think there is or can ever be such a thing as an ""idealised white person"", at best all we can achieve is some sort of idea of the vast diversity that exists within any given group of people, and even  then we are going to omit much of the variation.

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
Alun, with all due respect, you are asking the wrong question.  The question is not ""why"" is Marilyn Monroe the most iconic example etc.  The question is ""According to whom?""  When it comes to the article, if there is research on why people have different iconic representations of white people, we can discuss that research.  But when it comes to inclusion in the gallery I think the key issues are NPOV and V.  I am sure we all agree that there is no iconic representaton of ideal Whiteness that is shared by all people.  As with most things there are multiple points of view.  It may be a good idea to include images to represent each notable view of what a ""white person"" is.  I do not think Usergreatpower has to explain to us why anyone consideres MM the most iconic.  But she should be able to explain to us ''who'' believes this.

<user_id=Usergreatpower>
I have been bold and and added examples of white people who are undisputably white in an attempt to resolve the dispute of which examples should be shown due to dispute over who is considered white. This should now mean the article does not need to go without examples.

<user_id=Ramdrake>
Thank you for your efforts,  but please refer to the talk page and archives. Just adding pictures of people one feels are ""undeniably white"" as examples is a solution which has previously been discussed and rejected, as it was felt to be too arbitrary and not representative enough of the concept of ""whiteness"".

<user_id=Wikiscribe>
i agree and concur with ramdrakes statement

<user_id=Wobble>
I did warn Usergreatpower. Anyway, I have some alternative suggestions  if anyone would like to comment?

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
I like the idea, a lot! The point is to peg each cluster of illustrations with a specific section of the article - so the photos illustrate ''parts of the article'' rather than the title of the article.

<user_id=Wikiscribe>
i also am ""very"" supportive of this particular idea and concur with slrubenstein statement and it could put an end to the picture charade within this article

<user_id=Ramdrake>
Excellent initiative! Although, Alun, we may need to do something about that wordiness of yours!! ;)

<user_id=Wobble>
Sorry. I guess if the images are placed in the correct sections of the article then we don't need to explain them so thoroughly. As stand alone images in my sandbox they needed a bit more explanation. Feel free to edit the wording etc.

<user_id=Wobble>
OK, I cut the text down from one of the pictures, and ""hid"" some of the text for another. Is this any better?

<user_id=Usergreatpower>
Why no examples of people who are considered universally to be White? Why just ones who are considered by some to be White? I don't think displaying just examples of people whose status as being White is controversial is going to solve the previous problem of people not agreeing on who is really White. If anything it only exacerbates it. That's why I was in favour of having examples of people where there is no controversy over their status as being White and are universally considered to be White.

<user_id=Usergreatpower>
I'd like to point out the Dravidian people are not considered by any measure I know of to be White and references are needed for the such measures mentioned in the image's description. Plus the number of methods which consider Somali people to be White are very few at best and a definite minority position.

<user_id=Usergreatpower>
It's interesting to note that there are more pictures of people who most people wouldn't call White such as Africans and Indians than there are of ones most people would call White.

<user_id=Wobble>
What do you mean? We have John Beddoe, Lord Milner, Warren Harding, Robert Knox the image of the ""Celtic group"", why do you think ''none'' of those are considered ""universally white""? I'd have thought that at least Knox, Beddoe and Milner were considered white by all standards. So I don't think it's at all accurate say that there are ""no examples of people who are considered universally to be White"". I suggest you atek a look at some of the physical anthropological works of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In these there are certainly many instances of East Africans and Indians being considered ""white"". Actually not that long ago there were about four different images of maps of ""racial"" classifications that showed just that. When one dispences with skin colour as a determining factor, as craniometry did, then we get completely different so called ""races"".

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Usergreatpower** argues for the inclusion of example photos in the article, suggesting that other articles have photos throughout and not just in galleries. The user also raises concerns about the consensus-building process and alleges racial motivation behind the reverts.

2. **Wikiscribe** counters by emphasizing that the article is an encyclopedia entry, not a picture book, and that a gallery already exists with a broad spectrum of examples. The user also points out that the presence of pictures in other articles does not justify their inclusion in this one.

3. **Ramdrake** points out that previous discussions on the talk page reached a consensus against having images in the article body and that the gallery suffices. The user also asks for patience in waiting for responses and dismisses the accusation of racism.

4. **Wobble** questions the choice of Marilyn Monroe as an iconic example of an idealized white person, arguing that there is no single idealized representation of whiteness and that diversity within any group should be acknowledged.

5. **Slrubenstein** shifts the focus to the need for verifiable sources that support the claim of Marilyn Monroe being an iconic representation of whiteness, emphasizing the importance of neutrality and verifiability.

6. **Usergreatpower** attempts to resolve the dispute by adding images of people who are ""undeniably white,"" but this approach is rejected by **Ramdrake** as arbitrary and not representative of the concept of ""whiteness.""

7. **Wobble** proposes an alternative approach to integrate images with specific sections of the article to illustrate parts of the article rather than the title, which receives support from **Wikiscribe** and **Slrubenstein**.

8. **Usergreatpower** continues to push for examples of people universally considered white, expressing dissatisfaction with the inclusion of controversial examples and questioning the categorization of certain groups as white.

9. **Wobble** defends the choices by referencing historical anthropological works and the changing criteria for racial classification, suggesting that the concept of ""whiteness"" is not as clear-cut as **Usergreatpower** implies.

Overall, the discussion shows a range of perspectives with varying degrees of adherence to Wikipedia's guidelines on neutrality, verifiability, and consensus. Some arguments are more focused on policy and precedent, while others are more emotive or based on personal opinion. The dialogue also reflects an attempt to balance the inclusion of images with the encyclopedic nature of the article and the diversity of views on race and representation.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

<user_id=FreeatlastChitchat>
added some content which I deleted. My reason is Wikipedia:Independent sources says that An independent source is a source that has no vested interest in a written topic and therefore it is commonly expected to describe the topic from a disinterested perspective. But the content that was added came from an author who has been writing hate literature against the entire community since he started writing, also the website in the reference is one which ONLY published hate literature against the community. I don't think that these are reliable sources. If you do not agree please discuss here.

<user_id=Xtremedood>
I see that you have once again removed a valuable and crucial criticism in that section. I have checked the sources and no where is hate promoted against anybody. I have also provided four sources. The criticism is rather simple, but necessary to maintain a neutral atmosphere. Many critics of the so called ""sun and moon eclipse prophecy"" maintain that the eclipses never happened on the dates provided in the ""prophecy."" These are the four sources of criticism that I have referenced.
As I have stated, I have checked these four distinct and separate sources and no where have I read hate speech. They make rational statements pertaining to the issue at hand. The statement, ""Some critics also claim that the lunar eclipse did not occur on the first night of Ramadan and the solar eclipse did not occur on the middle day of the month as detailed in the prophecy"" should therefore remain and not be removed. The questioning of the veracity of the dates of the eclipses is a crucial issue that should not be ignored. Let us examine the four sources: 1) ""FLAWS IN THE AHMADIYYA ECLIPSE THEORY"" is written by Dr David McNaughton. David examines ""Ahmadiyya"" claims and criticizes their conclusions and approaches. 2) "" Exposing Qadiani Falsehood on the Internet and on TV - The Fraud of Eclipses"" is written by the organization 'Idara Dawat-O-Irshad' in the United States, and they are operating freely and have not to my knowledge been accused of promoting hate or intolerance. They make criticisms of the ""sun and moon prophecy"" theory. 3) ""Muhammad is the Last Prophet"" by Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi is published by the Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania, which is an active organization. They are reputable amongst the Shia community and are not considered a hate group. The statement expressing the position of these critics of the prophecy theory should therefore remain. We have Sunni, Shia, non-Muslim, etc. critics who disagree with the ""Ahmadiyya"" position of the so called prophecy. Disagreeing in this manner is not hate speech.

<user_id=FreeatlastChitchat>
as far as your statement that ""FLAWS IN THE AHMADIYYA ECLIPSE THEORY"" is written by Dr David McNaughton so is reliable. Well the eclipse occurred and was documented by newspapers as well as other journals so saying that it did not occur is like saying that a historic even did not occur. You cannot contest the occurrence once something has happened. Your second statement that Idara Dawat-O-Irshad is not spewing hate literature is not true. You can look at their website and you will see hundreds of hate statements. This has been discussed on this very talkpage before you should read the entire talk page before commenting on validity of such a source. Your third source is invalid because Manzur Chinioti is a hate preacher and I can cite at least five hundred links to his hate statements. However your fourth source seems ok to me now that I have read it, I would like to apologize for removing it, i should not have bundeled it up with others. Feel free to add the content from the fourth source i.e ""Muhammad is the Last Prophet"" by Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi

<user_id=Xtremedood>
There is ample evidence to counter your historicity claim. I also do not see any hate speech in those sources, however I think those two sources are sufficient to get the point across and I have therefore removed the Idara Dawat-O-Irshad and Manzur Chinioti (because it was not in English) references. The statement ""Some critics also claim that the lunar eclipse did not occur on the first night of Ramadan and the solar eclipse did not occur on the middle day of the month as detailed in the prophecy"" and the remaining references are however valid and should remain.

<user_id=FreeatlastChitchat>
There is ample evidence to counter your historicity claim.Really? Well you should visit http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsearch/SEsearchmap.php?Ecl=18940406, I put it in url so that everyone can see that the site belongs to NASA. So please provide any source valid enough to counter NASA or else please remove the historicity content.

<user_id=Xtremedood>
I have checked the url you provided and it does nothing to strengthen your claim, rather thanks for providing that link to me as it disproves your claim entirely. Let us examine the initial prophecy: ""For our Mahdi there are two signs which have never appeared before since the creation of the heavens and the earth, namely the moon will be eclipsed on the first night in Ramadan and the sun will be eclipsed on the middle day in the same month of Ramadhan, and these signs have not appeared since God created the heavens and the earth."" According to this statement, there should be a lunar eclipse on the 1st day of Ramadan and a solar eclipse on the middle day of the month. NASA claims no such thing happened, you can check the data. According to data the solar eclipse occurred on the 28th day of Ramadan, not the 15th and the lunar eclipse occurred on the 13th day of Ramadan, not the first. According to the Islamic Finder date conversion, April 06, 1894 converts to Ramadan 29th, 1311 AH

<user_id=FreeatlastChitchat>
This talk page has something written at the VERY TOP you should read it before scrolling down. It says that this is not a forum to discuss the topic in general ""This is not a forum for general discussion of the article's subject."" Please stay on topic about the sourcing.
You said that ""There is ample evidence to counter your historicity claim"", whereby you meant that there is AMPLE evidence to suggest that the eclipse did not occur and therefore the website blog/article by David McNaughton is a reliable source.
I countered this by saying that NASA has shown and accepted that the eclipse did indeed occur. Therefore the historicity of the event cannot be challenged without some powerful evidence.
What you wrote has nothing to do with this. Please stay on topic and discuss this. Here on WP we do not discuss anyones claims, we just create content based on sources, anything else is original research.

<user_id=Xtremedood>
You misunderstand my statements. You are the one bringing the primary research with your NASA website. I agree Wikipedia is not the place for this, but this was a necessary thing for me to do to counter your point that your website was a source for your claim, which it is not. NASA data in no way supports the ""Ahmadiyya"" prophecy claim. I request you to stop bringing original research into this. I have already provided you with four references containing proofs and views by a variety of sources that counter the fulfillment of the prophecy claim. Remember, the prophecy itself claims that the lunar eclipse should happen on the 1st day of Ramadan and the solar eclipse on the middle day of the month (15th). There are currently two views being shared on the article as of now, the view of critics claiming that it is weak and the view of ""Ahmadis"" that it is sound. There however is no information (as of now) on the article indicating a crucial view that the prophecy was not fulfilled in the first place. The criticism that the prophecy has not been fulfilled should be shared and there are two major points for this view, the first being that the solar eclipse and lunar eclipses did not occur on the days prophecized and the second point is that the prophecy itself applies prior to the arrival of the Mahdi, not after. This is clearly expressed on page 100 of ""Muhammad is the Last Prophet"" by Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi.

You are again muddling up the issue. Keep the discussion simple and you wont be ""misunderstood"". To simplify this discussion let us discuss one point at one time. Let us begin by discussing the simplest thing first. i.e the historicity of the event. You are saying that there is someone who says that the eclipse did not occur and you have given the source of David McNaughton. You have said that as ""There is ample evidence to counter your historicity claim"", so according to you the content added to the article should show that the eclipse may not even have occurred. I am countering this my providing you with data from NASA, which is more reliable than a website article. So what is your counter argument to this? You can either say that ""ok"" the eclipse did occur as NASA says, or you can say that ""NO"" it did not occur and then provide some source which is as authentic as, if not more than, NASA. Let us first discuss this then move on to other points.

<user_id=Xtremedood>
I am being clear and concise. NASA never shows that a lunar eclipse occurred on the 1st day of Ramadan and never shows that a solar eclipse happened on the 15th. The date on the NASA website is likely on the 29th of Ramadan, according to Gregorian to Hijri calendar conversions, NOT on the 1st or 15th. The content shows that the eclipse did NOT happen on the 1st and 15th days of Ramadan as described by the prophecy. The content is clear. Therefore the criticism should remain. Wikipedia is not the place for such religious propaganda. Also, do not bring about such original research as well.

<user_id=FreeatlastChitchat>
HISTORICITY means that the event occurred or not. Either you accept that or you say that it did not occur. This is why I wanted to talk about this first. If you admit that the eclipse did indeed occur, even if it occurred on the 29th, you cannot bring the David McNaughton source into the mix because his claims are refuted by NASA data. Simple as that. We are not going to discuss the prophecy I already told you that, we will just put in what ""reliable"" sources tell us about its occurrence. and the most reliable of sources ,NASA, says that it did occur. The first and fifteenth of the month do not have any possibility of an eclipse. There has never been any contest about those days. The hadith clearly uses a pronoun to say the eclipse will occur in the middle or the first of ""the possible"" days and nights.So please either agree with NASA or present some argument against their data.

<user_id=Xtremedood>
Nobody denies solar and lunar eclipses occur. The issue is not whether or not the solar or lunar eclipses occur. It is scientific fact that they occur. The issue is if they occurred in 1894/1895 on the date outlined by the prophecy itself (the 1st and 15th of Ramadan respectivly). NASA shows it did not happen on these dates. The four sources I have indicated also say the same thing. Therefore, the claim to the fulfillment of the prophecy is false. However, ""Ahmadis"" may claim otherwise. I am proposing a neutral and impartial representation of the views on this article, which includes three criticisms on the article, 1) the veracity of the prophecy itself (which is already on the article), 2) the indication that critics do not believe the eclipses occured on the 1st and 15th respectively, and 3) according to critics the prophecy is referring to before the arrival of the Mahdi, not after. I believe I have demonstrated quite rationally and soundly that my points are valid. Your statements are quite clear and demonstrate your incoherance, if you have nothing else to say I believe it is now time to remedy the situation and fix this portion of the article.

<user_id=FreeatlastChitchat>
The article is ok as it is. The prophecy does not say that the sun and moon will be eclipsed on the 1st and the fifteenth. You should read the Arabic prophecy before making such a claim. It does not mention dates. It mentions that the eclipse will occur on the first of the nights i.e the first of the nights when an eclipse ""can occur"" and the sun on the middle day i.e middle of the days when the eclipse can occur. Why will you want to put ""the indication that critics do not believe the eclipses occurred on the 1st and 15th respectively,"" when there is no claim from the person Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Sahib Alaih Salam that they occurred on these dates? He claimed that the moon was eclipsed on the first of its possible nights and the sun was eclipsed on the middle one of its possible days. This was his claim. As I have rendered your first two points moot. let us move onto the third. Which source would you like to use for it? and what content would you like to put in.

",1,"The discussion revolves around the inclusion of a criticism regarding the occurrence of a solar and lunar eclipse as part of a prophecy in the Ahmadiyya community. The main points of contention are the historicity of the event, the interpretation of the prophecy, and the reliability of the sources cited.

**FreeatlastChitchat's Argument:**
- FreeatlastChitchat argues that the eclipses did occur and are documented by reliable sources like NASA.
- They emphasize that Wikipedia should not include content based on unreliable sources, especially those that may be considered to produce hate literature.
- They point out that the prophecy does not specify the 1st and 15th of Ramadan as the dates for the eclipses but rather the first of the possible nights and the middle of the possible days for an eclipse to occur.
- They maintain that the discussion should focus on the sourcing and not the general discussion of the topic.

**Xtremedood's Argument:**
- Xtremedood argues that the criticism of the prophecy's fulfillment is valid and should be included in the article.
- They claim that the eclipses did not occur on the specific dates mentioned in the prophecy (1st and 15th of Ramadan) and cite various sources to support this claim.
- They assert that the NASA data does not support the occurrence of the eclipses on the specified dates of the prophecy.
- They propose including criticisms that the prophecy refers to events before the arrival of the Mahdi, not after.

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**
- The quality of the discussion is somewhat hampered by a lack of clarity and focus on the main issue. Xtremedood seems to misunderstand the prophecy's claim about the dates, which FreeatlastChitchat corrects by explaining the meaning of ""the first of the nights"" and ""the middle of the days.""
- FreeatlastChitchat's insistence on reliable sourcing and adherence to Wikipedia's standards strengthens their argument.
- Xtremedood's argument is weakened by the misinterpretation of the prophecy and the reliance on sources that FreeatlastChitchat challenges for their reliability and potential bias.
- The discussion could benefit from a clearer presentation of the sources and a more direct engagement with the actual wording of the prophecy.
- Both parties could improve the quality of the discussion by focusing more on the verifiability and neutrality of the content rather than the interpretation of the prophecy itself.

Considering the above points, the discussion shows an effort to engage with the topic critically, but it is marred by misunderstandings and a lack of focus on the core issue of source reliability and the actual claims of the prophecy. The arguments presented by FreeatlastChitchat are generally more coherent and aligned with Wikipedia's standards for sourcing and content inclusion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Mhhossein>
Paul Craig Roberts

<user_id=Mhhossein>
I just wanted to let you know that you had probably missed a point in self-published sources that ''""Self-published expert sources may be considered reliable when produced by an established expert on the subject matter, whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable third-party publications.""'' Paul Craig Roberts, as his page shows, is an expert with enough experience. you may look at his CV and the books he has authored. So, I'll  undo your edit.

<user_id=Anders Feder>
I did look at his CV, which says he is an economist. How does that make him an established expert on Iran or communication studies?

<user_id=Mhhossein>
He doesn't need to be an established expert on Iran or communication studies for making such a comment. As you see he has authored books such as ""How America Was Lost: From 9/11 to the Police/Warfare State"" and ""The Capitalist Revolution in Latin America"" and consider that Economics is not a discrete field falling far from political issues. He seems experienced enough for judging ""Western politicians and media"".

<user_id=Anders Feder>
If you read your own quotation above: ""Self-published expert sources  be considered reliable ."" Is economics the subject matter of the ayatollah's letter or any matter surrounding it?

<user_id=Mhhossein>
Of course, the action of sending such a letter as a message to the youth is within the realm of his expertise. By the way, he is not merely an economist, as his published views suggest.

<user_id=Anders Feder>
That is not what I asked. Answer my question, please. His views are completely irrelevant - Wikipedia is not a soapbox.  (UTC

<user_id=Mhhossein>
It is already answered. 1-Economics is not a discrete field falling far from social issues. 2- his published views are relevant to such a social issue. 3- He authored books on economical and socio political issues.

<user_id=Anders Feder>
Yes or no? Sidestepping the question does not result in it being answered.

<user_id=Mhhossein>
It is not sidestepping. Please read the comments to get your answer and consider that he is not merely an economist. Btw is it merely an economical book?

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Mhhossein argues that Paul Craig Roberts is an established expert whose self-published work could be considered reliable based on his expertise and previous publications. Mhhossein points to Roberts' experience and books on socio-political issues as evidence of his expertise.

2. User Anders Feder challenges the relevance of Roberts' expertise in economics to the specific subject matter of the ayatollah's letter and surrounding issues. Feder is questioning whether Roberts' expertise in economics directly translates to being a reliable source on Iran or communication studies.

3. Mhhossein responds by stating that economics is closely related to social issues and that Roberts' published views on socio-political matters make him qualified to comment on the letter. Mhhossein emphasizes that Roberts is not just an economist but has broader expertise.

4. Anders Feder seeks a direct answer to whether economics is the subject matter of the ayatollah's letter, implying that expertise in one field does not automatically confer expertise in another.

5. Mhhossein insists that Roberts' expertise is relevant and that his work is not limited to economics, suggesting that his broader socio-political insights are applicable.

Evaluation of Argument Quality:

- Mhhossein provides a rationale for considering Roberts an expert based on his publications and broader socio-political insights. However, the argument could be strengthened by providing specific examples of Roberts' work that directly relate to the subject matter in question.
  
- Anders Feder's argument is focused on ensuring the relevance of the source to the specific topic. Feder's insistence on a direct answer is a strong rhetorical strategy to clarify the applicability of Roberts' expertise to the subject matter.

- The discussion could benefit from more direct evidence linking Roberts' expertise to the specific topic of the ayatollah's letter and the broader context of Iran and communication studies.

- Both parties maintain a relatively civil tone, and the discussion is focused on the content and relevance of the source rather than personal attacks or unrelated issues.

Overall, the discussion shows engagement with the topic and an attempt to apply Wikipedia's standards for reliable sources. However, the arguments could be more focused on providing direct evidence of relevance to the specific subject matter.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Parsecboy>
Something to consider: in Google books, we have the following results:
Agstev river - 53
Aghstev river - 20
Aghstafa river - 2 (one of which does not refer to the river, but to the city
Agstafa river - 7 (only one of which appears to be about the river)
In Google Scholar, we get the following:
Aghstev river - 9 (of which 2 appear to refer to the river)
Agstev river - 9 (most of which appear to be about the river)
Agstafa river - 16 (only one appears to be about the river)
Aghstafa river 9 (only 1 or 2 appear to be about the river)
Based on this fairly quick Google sampling, it seems that either Agstev or Aghstev are favored in scholarly books, while they are pretty evenly split in scholarly journals (i.e, only a couple of appearances for each spelling variation). Based on the Google Book results, it seems that Agstev is the preferred spelling in English.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
It is preferred spelling, when Armenia is described, but the books and articles about Azerbaijan use the name of Aghstafa. The river has different names in different countries, but there does not seem to be a generally accepted English version of the name, that is used to refer to the river along its entire length. I have never seen a book or a serious international source that would call Azerbaijani section of the river Aghstev, and the city of Aghstafa cannot be located on the river of Aghstev. There are no towns called after this river in Armenia, that's why the spelling of Aghstafa is better.

<user_id=Parsecboy>
Check the first result in the Google Book search for Agstev. It's a UN publication that refers to both Armenia and Azerbaijan, and uses Agstev river.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
The most popular in google books is Russianized spelling Akstafa river, which gets 254 hits:  It is the most popular spelling since the region was a part of the Russian empire and USSR. Akstafa river also gets 36 hits on google scholar:

<user_id=Parsecboy>
Although by putting it in quotes (to remove the possibility of there being returns with just ""Akstafa"" or ""river""), you get 55 results for Akstafa. It seems that of the three, Aghstafa is the least preferred.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
Well, Akstafa is corrupted Aghstafa, so it is still the most popular spelling in scholarly literature. We can go with Akstafa, if that solves the problem. If we put Agstev river in quotes, it will get only 33 hits, which is less than 55 hits of Akstafa river, so the latter is more common.

<user_id=Parsecboy>
I would be fine with Akstafa, it is used by reputable organizations like the US's National Geographic Society.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
Me too, if no one objects.

<user_id=Brandmeister (old)>
One minor issue is that the letters ""gh"" in ""Aghstafa"" spelling more neatly deliver the Azeri sound ""ğ"".

<user_id=Grandmaster>
True. So let's decide, Aghstafa or Akstafa.

<user_id=Brandmeister (old)>
I personally sway to Aghstafa, as it is, but one may choose Akstafa for there are less clashing consonants.

<user_id=Parsecboy>
(od) Aghstafa seems to be the least preferred in English language sources. Akstafa seems preferable to me.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
I don't mind either Aghstafa or Akstafa. The latter is preferable, if we go for the most common name in English language sources.

<user_id=Vacio>
Akstafa is the Russian name of the river (and not a ""Russianized spelling""), and I don't agree that because ""Akstafa river"" and ""Aghstafa river"" ''together'' get more hits in books.google than Aghsev ''alone'', the latter must be left out. In ''google.com'' ""Akstafa river"" gets only '''25 hits''' , much lesser than ""Aghstev"" which gets '''239 hits''' . The fact that in ''books.google'' ""Aghstev river"" gets lesser hits than ""Akstafa river"" is because you get there generally academical stuff often based on Russian sources (some of these hits are from SSSR geographical documents). I think ''google.com'' shows clearly that ""Aghstev river"" is the most common name in English language sources. It is used by at least 2 UN publications () and also according to books.google () the from Agstev is used by:
American Meteorological Society
American Geological Institute
American Water Works Association
American Geographical Society of New York

<user_id=Vacio>
I therefore request that the title of the article should be moved ''back'' to ""Aghstev river"" before further discussion, because it was moved by Parishan without any discussion and I think it was not justified.

<user_id=Vacio>
Also, I think we should discuss the issue in a wider context. There are many rivers which first flow trough Armenia and later Azerbaijan. I hope we will not go each time the same way as here. We should discuss a general policy on naming such geographical names.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
According to the rules, google search is not a mandatory reason for rename of the articles. Google search returns mostly Armenian sources or sources reporting from Armenia. Akstafa is more popular with specialist sources, as it was demonstrated. Agstafa is also used by authoritative sources, and Akstafa used even more than any other name. So we should stick to either the present title, or Akstafa, as it is the most popular name in the specialist sources.

<user_id=Vacio>
And according to which rule the article was renamed from ""Aghstev river"" to Aghstafa river"" by Parishan?! And it absolutely untrue that google gets ''mostly Armenian sources or sources reporting from Armenia''. Look above how many non-Armenian organisations use the Agstev. The WP rules require that the most common name in English must be preferable, which in this case is manifsetly Aghstev.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
It is impossible to establish a common English name by a simple google search. Google books shows that the specialist sources prefer Akstafa.

<user_id=Meowy>
That's just because the English can't pronounce ""gh"" correctly! Given that the river is of minor international importance and notability, we can't use Google to decide on how it should be spelt. Nor can we directly use the Armenian or Azeri alphabets for the title. The name needs to be as close as possible to the actual pronounciation. For either version, ""gh"" seems closer than ""k"". As for which version to use, there should be Wikipedia guidelines. The problem must have come up before, and not just in relation to Armenia/Azerbaijan cross-border rivers. How much of the river is in Armenia, how much is in Azerbaijan? Is it more important in one country than in the other? Is it usual to refer to rivers that are tributaries of larger rivers by their source name, or by the name in use at the locations where they join the larger rivers?

<user_id=Grandmaster>
I believe the importance of Azeri spelling of Aghstafa or the Russian Akstafa is based on the fact that there's a town in Azerbaijan, named after the river. The town of Aghstafa is the center of the district by the same name. It would look strange if we write that the town of Aghstafa is located on the river Aghstev, after which it is named. At the same time, no town in Armenia is named after this river.

<user_id=Vacio>
That argument makes no sense whatsoever. There is a town in Armenia called Yeraskh, so according to you a can go and just move Aras River to Yeraskh River without even adding a letter to the talk page!? It is also a false argumantation of you as if the longest part of the river flows trough Azerbaijan. The part of the river which flows through Armenian is twice longer than the part of it in Azerbaijan (see this map)!

<user_id=Grandmaster>
Aras is different. It is a large river, known in English sources for centuries. Akstafa is a small river, and it forms only one town, the center of a district.

<user_id=Meowy>
Maybe we have to look at it at a different angle. Articles have titles so that the articles can be found. What would someone searching for information about the river call the river, bearing in mind that they are searching the English-language Wikipedia? So maybe Akstafa ''is'' the best choice. (Yep - I know I was saying it wasn't in the last post I made!)

<user_id=Grandmaster>
I don'tmind, let it be Russianized Akstafa, after all, it is the name accepted in scholarly sources.

<user_id=Vacio>
Meowy, for what reason the article would bear the title ''Akstafa'', when it is almost 10x lesser common in google then Aghstev? Also why would a river which flows through ''Armenia'''and for a little part in ''Azerbaijan'', have an ''Russian'' name? Please also note that I have been asking for reasonable arguments in support for the troublesome move of the article by Parishan (who so far has not typed a single word in this talkpage). What concerns me here is the policy of some Azeri users, the ''first'' move an Armenian name ''then'' try to justify it with false argumantations: (hits in google.az, representing the Russian name of the river as a ""corrupt spelling"", asserting that the part of the river which flows through Azerbaijan is longer than which flows through Armenia, etc).

<user_id=Grandmaster>
Google search is not a mandatory reason for rename. As I said, Akstafa is the name used in scholarly literature, and there are cities named after the river in Azerbaijan.

",0,"The discussion revolves around the appropriate English name for a river that flows through Armenia and Azerbaijan. The participants are debating which name is most commonly used and recognized in English language sources, considering variations like Agstev, Aghstev, Aghstafa, and Akstafa.

1. User Parsecboy starts by presenting data from Google Books and Google Scholar, suggesting that Agstev or Aghstev are favored in scholarly books, while the usage is split in scholarly journals. This is a data-driven approach that provides a good foundation for the argument.

2. User Grandmaster counters by emphasizing the regional naming conventions, stating that Aghstafa is used when referring to the Azerbaijani context. This introduces the idea that the river's name may vary by country, which is a relevant point in the discussion.

3. User Parsecboy then points out a UN publication using Agstev, which is a strong argument for the international recognition of that name.

4. User Grandmaster shifts the argument to the Russianized spelling Akstafa, citing its prevalence in Google Books and Google Scholar. This introduces another dimension to the debate, considering historical context and the influence of Russian sources.

5. User Parsecboy and User Grandmaster seem to reach a tentative agreement on Akstafa, based on its usage by reputable organizations.

6. User Brandmeister (old) raises a linguistic point about the pronunciation of ""gh"" in Aghstafa, which is a valid consideration for the English spelling of non-English names.

7. User Vacio challenges the move to Aghstafa and advocates for Aghstev, citing its usage by UN publications and several American organizations. This is a strong argument for Aghstev, based on authoritative sources.

8. User Grandmaster argues that Google search results are not a definitive reason for renaming articles and that specialist sources prefer Akstafa. This is a weaker argument since it dismisses the broader usage of the name in favor of specialist sources without fully addressing the counterpoints.

9. User Meowy introduces the practical aspect of what an English speaker would search for, leaning towards Akstafa. This is a pragmatic approach but does not fully engage with the evidence presented earlier in the discussion.

10. User Vacio continues to argue for Aghstev based on its commonality in Google searches and questions the rationale behind the initial move of the article. This insistence on the most common English name aligns with Wikipedia's naming conventions.

Overall, the discussion quality is quite high. Participants are using data, authoritative sources, linguistic considerations, and practical implications to argue their points. The debate is mostly civil, with users presenting evidence to support their positions. However, there are moments where arguments could be more directly addressed or where certain points are dismissed without thorough consideration.

Nature of the Work

<user_id=Research Method>
Currently the work is described as ""'''''An Oak Tree''''' is an iconicIrish Museum of Modern Art Website modernart.ie conceptual artwork created by Michael Craig-Martin RA in 1973.  The work consists of a glass of water on a glass shelf with an accompanying text,Bery, Bryony. ""An Oak Tree 1973: Technique and condition text"", Tate, June 2005. Retrieved 8 November 2008.Manchester, Elizabeth. ""An Oak Tree 1973: Short text, Tate, December 2002. Retrieved 8 November 2008. which states that the work is a fully grown oak tree which looks like a glass of water. Artist's Text Craig-Martin sees the work as a deconstruction of art to reveal its basic component of belief.""
This is a misleading description of a dematerialized conceptual artwork. The idea is more important than the shelf etc.
MCM =""I considered that in An Oak Tree I had deconstructed the work of art in such a way as to reveal its single basic and essential element, belief that is the confident faith of the artist in his capacity to speak and the willing faith of the viewer in accepting what he has to say. In other words belief underlies our whole experience of art: it accounts for why some people are artists and others are not, why some people dismiss works of art others highly praise, and why something we know to be great does not always move us. "" He doesn't mention shelves at all.

<user_id=Tyrenius>
The introduction is closely referenced to sources. Read them: ""In an artist interview in May 2003 Craig-Martin noted that the piece consists of two units; the object and the text."" There are numerous references that begin discussing the work by stating, as the Tate does, that ""An Oak Tree consists of an ordinary glass of water placed on a small glass shelf"". We follow the lead of such sources in our approach. Anything else violates WP:NPOV and becomes WP:OR. This is wikipedia policy and is non-negotiable. Please follow it. ''''''''''

<user_id=Research Method>
NPOV means including all view points. Your sources do not support what you are saying, within the context that you state it. If you read them, you will see that the ""art"" is in the Oak Tree or glass of water debate, not in the shelf.

<user_id=Tyrenius>
NPOV means giving due weight to sources, i.e. the majority sources get the majority weight. The majority of sources discuss the work in the way which the article now discusses it, i.e. by describing what it physically consists of, before then examining the conceptual aspects and Craig-Martin's claim for the work. Your argument is an interpretation of the sources and not a following of them. If you have a problem with this, then state clearly and succinctly the text you object to and what you think it should say, and we will get outside input on this. ''''''''''

<user_id=Research Method>
Examine the section ""WORK' it contains lots of stuff that doesn't describe the nature of work itself.
It starts ""An Oak Tree is a celebrated[5] artwork created by Michael Craig-Martin RA in 1973. It is now recognized as a turning point in the development of conceptual art, although initially it was met with surprise, if not scorn[6]. It has been described as ""questioning the nature of reality.""[5]
Interviewed in May 2003, Craig-Martin said the work consists of two parts, text and object.[2] The text is in red print on white; the object is a Duralex glass, which contains water to a level stipulated by the artist and which is located on a glass shelf, whose ideal height is 253 centimetres with matt grey-painted brackets screwed to the wall.[2] The text is behind glass and is fixed to the wall with four bolts.[2] Craig-Martin has stressed that the components should maintain a pristine appearance and in the event of deterioration, the brackets should be resprayed and the glass and shelf even replaced.[2]"""" I think it should start by saying that it is a fully grown oak tree, or at least that it should say that sooner than it does. Most sources talk of a glass of water. Critic's reception should be put in that section. The article is a mess.

<user_id=Tyrenius>
I've moved the element of critical evaluation into the Critical reaction section per your observation. The work section describes the content of the work, its nature, and its place within MCM's oeuvre and development. If this section becomes over-long, then it would be appropriate to split it into two sections, one about its construction and conceptual content, the other about its place relating to his other work. Articles should not, however, be divided into choppy sections each with a heading. The idea is for longer continuous sections of prose.

<user_id=Tyrenius>
I think it should start by saying that it is a fully grown oak tree is nonsense. That is an assertion made by the artist as to what it is. The secondary sources do not say it is a fully grown oak tree; they say it is an artwork that consists of a glass of water on a shelf, which MCM asserts is an oak tree. We follow sources. You are pushing your own interpretation. You might like to read WP:TEND. We do not at any point say that it is a fully grown oak tree, unless you find sources that tell us that it is a fully grown oak tree. We can say the text asserts it is a fully grown oak tree, or that MCM says it is a fully grown oak tree, but that is as far as it goes. This fact is in the second sentence as is appropriate.
The article is well constructed and follows wikipedia guidelines.
'''''''''

<user_id=Tyrenius>
I've just explained that the article should not consist of short sections each with a heading. You promptly did just that. Could you explain why you have done so? ''''''''''

<user_id=Research Method>
Because the text did not fit the heading. As I understand it, it is appropriate to create headings while the article is still a stub, that will later be filled with text.

<user_id=Tyrenius>
That's not standard practice. Let the article evolve. When there is more text, then break it down, step by step and add headings. The heading is quite OK: ""Artwork"", which covers the content in general terms. I don't think the reader is going to have a problem with that. It's not a stub any more. ''''''''''

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User <user_id=Research Method> argues that the description of the artwork ""An Oak Tree"" should emphasize the conceptual aspect of the work rather than its physical components. They suggest that the artwork is about the debate between seeing an oak tree or a glass of water, and that the shelf is not the focus.

2. User <user_id=Tyrenius> counters by stating that the introduction of the article is based on sources that describe the physical components of the artwork before delving into the conceptual aspects. They emphasize adherence to Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View (NPOV) policy and the importance of following the majority of sources.

3. User <user_id=Research Method> insists that NPOV means including all viewpoints and that the sources do not support the current description within the context it is stated. They argue that the ""art"" is in the conceptual debate, not the physical shelf.

4. User <user_id=Tyrenius> reiterates the importance of giving due weight to sources according to their prevalence and that the majority of sources discuss the work by describing its physical components. They invite <user_id=Research Method> to provide a clear and succinct objection and alternative text for outside input.

5. User <user_id=Research Method> points out that the ""WORK"" section contains information that does not describe the nature of the work itself and suggests that it should start by stating that it is a fully grown oak tree or at least mention this sooner.

6. User <user_id=Tyrenius> moves the critical evaluation element to the appropriate section and explains that the work section should describe the content and nature of the work, as well as its place within the artist's oeuvre. They also clarify that the article should not assert that the artwork is a fully grown oak tree but can state that the artist asserts it is.

7. User <user_id=Tyrenius> explains why they reverted the addition of headings by <user_id=Research Method>, stating that it is not standard practice to create headings for a stub that will later be filled with text.

8. User <user_id=Research Method> justifies their addition of headings as a way to organize content that did not fit the existing heading.

In doing some preliminary (original) research, I've found that Italian bakeries never call these 'Rainbow Cookies', although Brooklyn area Jewish bakeries do call them that. Seeing that these are Italian cookies, it might make sense to have the title refer to a more traditional name. However, we definitely need some good sources. Any takers?

<user_id=Luminifer>
Real name?

<user_id=J. Van Meter>
Not entirely true. Doing some internet searching I have found some Italian bakeries calling them Rainbow Cookies. Don't want to add any commercial links here, but do a Google image search for Italian Rainbow Cookies and you'll find them.  Also called Tri-colors.

<user_id=Luminifer>
Yeah, there are some - but I think that describing the Italian flag as a rainbow is kind of a strange thing to do. I wish there was a real source as to the original name of these cookies - if there is one - and how they were created. I have heard (local) Brooklyn rumors about how they were invented in the states. I'm going to move your sources to a different section since they describe the name but don't really go into the historical nature of the cookies or their name. Hope that's ok! Glad to find someone who's also interested in this!

<user_id=J. Van Meter>
i think here in wikiland comments posted on message boards are not considered 'reliable sources', and it looks like that's all you've got to back up some of the other names you've listed.  adding back that ""citation needed"" tag -when a couple lines down there are four sources listed- just looks weird. i can appreciate your wanting to verify the ""''original'' name"", but at the moment, we've got several published sources to back up ""rainbow"". (not to overlook the fact that it is the name of the article.)
right now the article reads, ""rainbow cookies...also referred to by other names including rainbow cookies""  that's just silly. but i don't want to get into an edit war over it. ""italian flag cookie"" is unsourced, as is the whole section about bakeries in bensonhurst.
i don't think it's the best form to get into a name list even ''before'' the description of the actual thing. see Wedding soup for a better example. but whatever.

<user_id=Luminifer>
I did not know about the 'dubious' tag - thanks for that! Regarding what is considered a reliable source in 'wikiland', I think it really depends on context. I don't have time to really find good sources, but I don't think the fact that I don't have time to find them means that this article should contain misinformation. )

<user_id=Luminifer>
Ok, it feels to me like that last edit was a fairly hostile and unwarranted act - nowhere in those references that you supplied does it suggest that Rainbow Cookies is the original name - in fact, there is no history discussed at all. I thought you were being helpful in wanting to get to the truth of this matter; is that not the case? You just completely undid the efforts of two other wikipedians.

<user_id=ChildofMidnight>
I think the concern over the dubious tag is warranted Lumin. There's not really any dispute that they're called Rainbow cookies, the dispute seems to be more about whether that should be the name of the article and whether that's the most notable name. I looked into it a little bit and Rainbow cookie seems to be the most prominent name for the cookies that I could find. I mentioned the issue on the food and drink project talk page, but unless someone takes an interest there may not be any response. How do you propose we sort out what name to use for the article and the first sentence?

<user_id=Luminifer>
I would be perfectly happy to let it sit there with a 'dubious' tag for a while, and see if anyone can find any concrete sources with historical information. I'll look myself if I have time - I suspect the internet won't supply much (I know that the area I grew up in is not entirely internet savvy so I'll have to try other means!). I was concerned with wikipedia continuing to spread what I think is the incorrect (and, seriously, to some people offensive) name for this cookie - as long as there is something showing that it's not clear what the name for the cookie is, I'll be happy. Also, it should be obvious, but just because something is the most common name for something, on the internet, does not mean it is the most accurate or original name for that thing. ) Thanks for your assisstance again!

<user_id=Tvoz>
I don't get this at all - do a google search on ""Rainbow cookies"" and you get over 4 million hits - this is what they are called. What's the issue? What is dubious?  /

<user_id=Luminifer>
(1) a lot of those hits are talking about other things called rainbow cookies - look at the images. (2) they are called different things in the neighborhoods where they (likely) originate - rainbow cookie seems to be a name they picked up when leaving their 'native' areas. (3) they are connected to the Italian flag, which is not a rainbow flag. (4) you can look up any of the other names listed, on google, and find they are also called those things. In this case, I would argue that the most common name is not necessarily correct, since these are originally a regional cookie. is that enough?

<user_id=Tvoz>
With all due respect, by the way, I have no idea what you think is offensive about ""Rainbow cookies"". As for what is ""correct"", that's not actually  our standard here  - our standard is what is verifiable, and as for names, what is most commonly used, or what is mostly likely to be searched on.   But actually I think you should concentrate more on the quality of the article - right now there's not much more than a list of names.  /

<user_id=Luminifer>
Can you show me where in WP that it states the corrent name is not the one that should be used?

<user_id=Luminifer>
Note that Sicilian pizza is not listed as an entry under ""square pizza"", which is basically what 'rainbow cookie' is to whatever the real name of this cookie is.

<user_id=Tvoz>
(I don't find ""rainbow cookies"" offensive myself, but I know people who do)

<user_id=Luminifer>
My hope is that the sources that tell a 'real' name would also reveal more about the origins of these cookies (which I have ideas about, but since they are unsourced, if I put them I'm sure someone will immediately delete them). I'll do it myself if/when I have the time. An example of a less common name that is the actual name of the article: sicilian pizza, when the more common phrase undoubtedly is ''square pizza pie''. Actually that's a very revelant comparison to what's going on here. All of this could easily be addressed by the suggestion below. And you can move on if you want, I'm sure this discussion can get along fine either way )

<user_id=Tvoz>
Maybe we have a regional problem here: in New York (perhaps I should say ""in the Bronx"") it is '''always''' called Sicilian pizza - never ""square pizza pie"". So it is not true to a NYer that the more common phrase ""undoubtedly"" is square pizza pie. In fact it's usually referred to as just ""Sicilian"". Not ""square"", even though the slices are indeed square. So I'd say that article is correctly titled as the most common name. (And the photo on that page is incorrect for Sicilian, so I don't know why they've included it.) And - in NY they are rainbow cookies, often more than three layers which may or may not resemble the colors of the Italian flag, but I've never seen them advertised or sold as ""Italian flag"" cookies. /

<user_id=Luminifer>
There are certainly pizzerias in Manhattan and Brooklyn that call them square slices. If you can find them outside of New York (their native habitat), like Boston, they are called square slices. Likewise, the ""rainbow cookie"", in its native habitat, has a different name (I have never heard Italian Flag Cookies - I grew up with ''seven layer'' myself) than elsewhere. So clearly there are regional issues - but you should realize that in one case, you are IN the region in question (I assume), and in the other, you are not. )

<user_id=Tvoz>
Yeah, well, there is New York, and then there's everywhere else.  I never claimed to be objective about that. /

<user_id=Luminifer>
Heh. Well, think about how you'd feel if the article _were_ called 'square pizza pie'.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Luminifer raises a concern about the accuracy of the name ""Rainbow Cookies"" for an Italian cookie, suggesting that it may not be the original or most appropriate name. They express a desire for historical accuracy and mention that the term might be offensive to some people.

2. User J. Van Meter provides evidence that the term ""Rainbow Cookies"" is used by some Italian bakeries, countering the claim that it is not used at all. They also point out that the article should not list the same name as both the primary and an alternative name, which would be redundant.

3. User Luminifer acknowledges the existence of the term but maintains that it may not be the original name and suggests that the article should reflect the uncertainty about the name's origin.

4. User ChildofMidnight suggests that the prominence of the name ""Rainbow Cookies"" in searches indicates its widespread use, which is a factor to consider when deciding the title of the article.

5. User Tvoz argues that the standard for Wikipedia is verifiability and common usage, not necessarily the ""correctness"" of a term. They also suggest that the focus should be on improving the article's content rather than debating the name.

6. User Luminifer compares the situation to the naming of ""Sicilian pizza,"" which is not called ""square pizza pie"" despite the latter being a descriptive term.

7. User Tvoz provides a regional perspective, stating that in New York, ""Sicilian pizza"" is the common term, and ""Rainbow Cookies"" is the term used for the cookies in question.

The discussion shows a mix of perspectives, with some participants emphasizing the importance of historical accuracy and original naming, while others focus on verifiability, common usage, and regional differences. The arguments presented are generally coherent and relevant to the topic, with users providing examples and reasoning to support their positions. However, there is a lack of concrete evidence regarding the original name of the cookies, which leaves the debate somewhat unresolved.

Considering the reasoning and arguments presented, the discussion is constructive, with participants engaging in a civil exchange of views and providing various insights into the naming issue. The discussion could be improved with more definitive historical sources or expert opinions on the original name of the cookies.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.",7.0

Psychometrics

<user_id=2601:D:2881:D20:ECF0:4A0E:ACF5:A68C>
The psychometrics section was deleted as it is a widely accepted area of psychology (scales such as the PANAS, the STAI, personality measures of the Big Five, etc. are widely validated and utilized by research psychologists and neuroscientists). Use of psychometrics are a direct consequence of the cognitive revolution. Prior citations appeared to be biased against psychometrics, and included a lot of pop-science books refuting IQ tests. While books like the Bell Curve are certainly wrong in their interpretations, IQ exams are well validated with primary literature to support their usage.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=Grayfell>
The current section should be rephrased to more neutrally reflect that there is a wide variety of views on this, and psychometrics is a fairly wide field itself, but removing it from this list completely doesn't seem appropriate. Being biased does not invalidate a source. This is a list of topics that have been characterized as pseudoscience by reliable sources. This is not a list of topics that ''are'' pseudoscience.

<user_id=TDJankins>
It goes without saying that those within a field itself assert its validity.  Obviously no one expects those within a pseudoscience to admit that it's a pseudoscience as that would threaten their livelihood.  The prevailing wisdom in the larger scientific community is that it's pseudoscience.  Volumes have been written on this fact and the subject has been beaten to a bloody pulp, but like many pseudosciences it perpetuates on despite what science has said about it.   No way should this page seek to confuse the public as to that fact.  It's bad enough Wikipedia has become a last bastion for these types.

<user_id=Fountains of Bryn Mawr>
Reverted this edit because no explanation was given for edit and the references used do not clearly support the material as presented in the article. Citing a Cronbach and Meehl work does not support a statement on ""controversy"", a source about a controversy would (WP:V). The second source does not seem to cover Psychometric validity/IQ Tests (also WP:V).

<user_id=2601:D:2881:D20:18A1:2C6B:2A82:23F5>
Do you have sources beyond books that decry the use of IQ exams? Where is the outcry of physicists against the SAT, ACT, GRE, or MCAT which are standardized psychometrics? As far as I can tell all of those exams are widely used with absolutely no outcry of the scientific community of peudoscience. I have supplied articles that discuss and give data on the validity of these tests in future performance, but I do not believe you read them. Most of the citations as listed in the article are in reference to claims that IQ tests assess innate aptitude, which is in fact not the scientific consensus now; instead it is now widely understood that the cause of differing IQ scores is multifaceted, but (and this is key!) they are not invalid at predicting future performance. Furthermore, your characterization of the issue as having been ""beaten into a bloody pulp"" is entirely misguided; did you not notice that psychological assessment courses are required for APA accreditation of clinical psychology programs? Or that psychometric work is accepted by APS journals? Or do you wish to question the validity and judgment of the entire field of clinical psychology? If you still have questions, I am more than willing to supply you with further empirical articles that clearly demonstrate the validity of psychometric data, which continues to be used in clinical, social, developmental, experimental, and biological psychology research.  If you can, I challenge you to clearly provide links to sources available online that provide support of this supposed ""scientific consensus"" against psychometrics, I would be glad to read them. — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=32.218.152.85>
Psychometrics is taught in every single college and university department of psychology in the world. One can earn a Ph.D. in the subject from any number of universities (e.g., , ). This means that it is not just some self-delusional subfield of psychology, but that it is recognized and sanctioned as a legitimate field of scholarship by higher education authorities worldwide. Citing a number of ignorant, skeptical crackpots to say that it's ""pseudoscience"" is the height of wikimania.

<user_id=Vsmith>
Stephen Gould was rather ''not'' an ''ignorant, skeptical crackpot''.

<user_id=Feldkurat Katz>
As it stands now, the article on Psychometrics flatly contradicts the section in this list claiming that it's pseudoscience. This claim, though possibly not limited to crackpots, is clearly a minority opinion and should be stated as such: WP:NPOV.

<user_id=TDJankins>
Do you know of any non-psychologists or non-psychometricians (those who do not practice psychometrics) who undertook a thorough investigation of psychometrics and were able to conclude that it's not a pseudoscience?  I think some people in this conversation are confusing whether something is done/used with whether it's pseudoscience.  Completely different concepts.

<user_id=Feldkurat Katz>
Wikipedia should not perform original research to establish the standards to judge pseudo-sciences and to determine whether X or Y is one or not. Wikipedia should refer the consensus of the scientific community, or, if there is no consensus, neutrally enumerate the major positions. In the case of, say, astrology, there is a clear consensus in the scientific community, proponents of astrology as a science are only found outside the scientific community. The case of psychometry is competely different, since it is widely accepted by mainstream science.
According to your reasoning, should we also include economics as a pseudoscience? In my opinion Trivers makes a better case against economics as, say, Gould does against psychometry, which I believe to have a better scientific grounding than many other branches of psychology. Its critics are mainly ideology-driven and attack psychometry because they don't like its findings. But my opinion is not relevant here, neither is yours. The scientific community is relevant here, and they largely accept psychometry, therefore the psychometry section in the article cannot stand as it is now.

<user_id=Grayfell>
I would support the inclusion of a sourced section on economics (Voodoo Economics comes to mind), but adding one to prove a WP:POINT is not the way to go about doing that. Psychometrics is widely accepted by most of academia. It is also characterized by a small, but not trivial, minority as being a pseudoscience. The current wording doesn't make that clear, and it doesn't make it clear that the field is broad enough to contain a range of practices. Some of those are on the fringe, and some are very mainstream. The section could stand to be reworded, removing it completely seems extreme.

<user_id=Myrvin>
I have had a go at rewording it. I'm not sure it was correct English as it was.

<user_id=TDJankins>
Psychometrics is clearly not accepted by mainstream science.  You saying that it is doesn't make it so. You need evidence.  '''Once again, do you know of any non-psychologists or non-psychometricians (those who do not practice psychometrics) who undertook a thorough investigation of psychometrics and were able to conclude that it's not a pseudoscience?''' Here we have cited five scholars from the larger scientific community who have each done such an investigation and concluded it is pseudoscience.

<user_id=TDJankins>
Taken from your edit summary: "" 'contrived' is weasel. 'Additionally' doesn't make sense. This is what critics say."" ""Contrived"" is a sourced word and clearly a true word as these are artificial tests just made up by some dude based on what he thinks is intelligence or creativity. ""Additionally"" does make sense as the first sentence is clearly describing a topic that is pseudoscience as IQ tests for example do not even measure what they purport to measure.  That is a widely accepted fact and one that has even been proven in a court of law.  It is impossible for any test to measure every aspect of intelligence in equal weight and thus it impossible for any test to measure ""intelligence.""  Further, it is impossible to isolate innate intelligence from learned abilities.  Measuring (metrics) elements of the mind (psycho-) is impossible. In regards to your comment ""this is what critics say,"" every description on this page is what critics say.  This page is not for representing pseudoscientific beliefs as fact.

<user_id=Feldkurat Katz>
We have heard you the first time, thank you. Repeating your arguments ad nauseam does not make them any better. A handful of cherry-picked critics, most of them known for an ideology-driven political agenda, does not represent the scientific community. I dare say I could find researchers in several fields outside psychology and psychometry, say, education, medicine or genetics (chosen at random, geneticist Tim Spector comes to mind) who uphold the validity of psychometry, but that's beside the point.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The first argument presented by user 2601:D:2881:D20:ECF0:4A0E:ACF5:A68C is that psychometrics is a widely accepted area of psychology, citing the use of various scales and tests that are validated and utilized by research psychologists and neuroscientists. This user argues that the deletion of the psychometrics section is unwarranted and that the field is supported by primary literature. This argument is fact-based and appeals to the authority of the psychological community, which is a reasonable strategy.

2. User Grayfell suggests that the section should reflect a wide variety of views on psychometrics and that it should not be removed completely. This user acknowledges the existence of reliable sources characterizing psychometrics as pseudoscience but also recognizes that this is not a unanimous view. This argument is balanced and calls for a neutral point of view, which is in line with Wikipedia's guidelines.

3. User TDJankins argues that the field's practitioners asserting its validity does not negate the possibility of it being pseudoscience. This user claims that the prevailing wisdom in the larger scientific community is that psychometrics is pseudoscience. However, this argument lacks specific evidence or references to support the claim of a prevailing wisdom against psychometrics.

4. User Fountains of Bryn Mawr points out that the references used do not clearly support the statements made in the article and that proper verification is needed. This user emphasizes the importance of adhering to Wikipedia's verification policy, which is a critical aspect of maintaining the quality of the encyclopedia.

5. User 2601:D:2881:D20:18A1:2C6B:2A82:23F5 challenges the claim that there is a scientific consensus against psychometrics and provides examples of its acceptance and use in various standardized tests. This user also offers to provide empirical articles demonstrating the validity of psychometric data. This argument is well-reasoned and invites further evidence-based discussion.

6. User 32.218.152.85 argues that psychometrics is taught worldwide and recognized by higher education authorities, suggesting its legitimacy as a field of scholarship. This argument appeals to the widespread acceptance and institutional validation of psychometrics.

7. User Vsmith simply states that Stephen Gould was not an ""ignorant, skeptical crackpot,"" which is a defense of Gould's credibility but does not directly address the quality of arguments regarding psychometrics.

8. User Feldkurat Katz argues that Wikipedia should reflect the consensus of the scientific community or enumerate major positions if no consensus exists. This user suggests that critics of psychometrics are mainly ideology-driven and that the field is widely accepted by mainstream science. This argument calls for a representation of the broader scientific perspective and is coherent with Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.

9. User TDJankins repeats the demand for evidence from non-psychologists or non-psychometricians who have investigated psychometrics and concluded it is not pseudoscience. This user also asserts that psychometrics is not accepted by mainstream science, but again, does not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.

10. User Myrvin attempts to improve the wording of the section for clarity and correctness, which is a practical approach to enhancing the quality of the article.

Overall, the discussion includes a mix of well-reasoned, evidence-based arguments and assertions that lack sufficient backing. Some participants call for neutrality and adherence to Wikipedia's policies, while others make claims without providing the necessary support. The discussion could benefit from more direct citations and a clearer representation of the scientific community's views on psychometrics.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Cuchullain>
This has come up before, and the fact is that the scholarly consensus about the Joan story is that it's fictional. The story can't be attested until centuries after she died, among other things. A number of relevant sources were mentioned, for instance, here. There are a few modern writers who claim the story is true, but they're not historians so far as I can tell, and historians don't take them seriously. /

<user_id=Cuchullain>
Scholarly consensus

<user_id=Cuchullain>
Again, the sources speak to a clear consensus among experts in the field that the story is a myth. Novelist Diana Cross and the Daily Mail aren't historians. /

<user_id=Kansas Bear>
I would have to agree with Cúchullain. Peter Stanford is not a historian and should not be used as a source for any historical article.

<user_id=189.8.107.196>
This is all nonsense. First of all, nowhere in the Wikipedia rules is it said that only historians serve as reliable source, whereas journalists or other academicists do not. Second of all, there is not even an official definition of what a historian is or is not! Third of all, if there were a definition, it is absolutely certain that someone whose one and only graduation career was History, in Cambridge, qualifies as a Historian. And fourth of all, if you like sources, Peter Stanford is called a ""Catholic historian"" by the BBChttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5355758.stm; a ""religious historian"" by Real-Islam.orghttp://www.real-islam.org/jesus/jesus_bbc4.html; an ""acclaimed religious commentator and historian"" by Michael Ardittihttp://www.michaelarditti.com/non-fiction/c-day-lewis/; an ""avid writer and historian"" by William Burgess Jrhttps://books.google.com.br/books?id=s4PdrEwSNRIC&pg;=PA59&lpg;=PA59&dq;=peter+stanford+historian&source;=bl&ots;=o2n_ohjVCS&sig;=MlSP2xPkyAtWINB1bMGvQh2_XFA&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=64fCVMH9KbOMsQSr0oDIDA&ved;=0CCUQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q;=peter%20stanford%20historian&f;=false; and is labeled a ""religious historian"" in the documentary ""Did Jesus Die?"", and therefore in iMDBhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3091044/?ref_=nm_flmg_slf_4, of which he participates.
All that taken into account, I think it is pretty clear that the fact that Stanford is not a historian or is not a serious writer is definitely NOT a consensus; and therefore the claim that all modern historians agree that Joan did not exist is definitely NOT a consensus either, what makes the current version of this Wiki page inaccurate, reflecting only the partial, biased position of some Wiki editors.
I have no doubt there is a very clear case for at the very least disputing the neutrality of the current version of this article.

<user_id=179.148.187.148>
I have got only one word regarding what this anon above just did: OWN'D.

<user_id=179.148.187.148>

<user_id=189.8.107.196>
And from time to time people will continue reverting it, because, as it's been already said before by different users, this article is clearly written from a biased officialist Catholic POV. Consensus hs one simple and only meaning, in all languages: if one single person disagrees with it, it is NOT a consensus. You may call it a near-consensus, you may say that ""most scholars agree"", I would even let you go with ""almost all scholars agree"", but you guys KNOW that there are reputable academicists and authors who deffend her story, and yet you are just chosing to ignore them just because they contradict your personal beliefs.
I have provided link and reference to the former editor of ""The Catholic Herald"", British scholar and writer Peter Stanford, who concluded in his huge book entirely about Pope Joan that ""Weighing all this evidence, I am convinced that Pope Joan was an historical figure, though perhaps not all the details about her are true"". It is blatant proof that the last sentence in the opening paragraph of this wikipedia article is simply incorrect - the addition of one simple word (""most"", even ""almost all"" if you'll feel better with it) would make the article academically correct, but the same users who have previously been accused by other users of turning this article into a biased piece of Catholic propaganda keep removing my correct references and continue ignoring any authors who do not 100% agree with their absolute certainty on such a historical matter on the grounds that it ""must be discussed first"". Well, then; let us discuss it, then.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=191.222.109.81>
It seems like there is controversy enough to allow the controversy to be featured in the article. It's obvious to me that, in order to provide readers with information (which is the objective of Wikipedia), the evidences gathered by scholars to support the hypotesis of her existence should be featured with sources, as well as the fact that the larger portion of scholars do not believe her historical existence, with the reasons to such discredit an sources too. Omitting controversy clearly jeopardize the neutrality of the article and prevent readers from knowing the most to continue their research outside wikipedia or knowing the most about the topic as an end in itself.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

Google searches are not a standard of quality we allow here, especially since the algorithm on which google searches are based customizes search results to each person/computer based on past searches.  I, for example, get nothing on Peter Stanford when I google ""expert on Pope Joan"".

I had just made the first Wiki post of my life above, complimenting the anonymous OP for what I see as a long-overdue rebuff against what is clearly a bias in this ""article"" (which indeed looks more like a piece of officialist propaganda), and even my comment was censored out of this talk page.

<user_id=Dr.K.>
So, I repeat: kudos, OP. Kudos. This article is the most blatant example of what a neutral article is NOT that I could find in years around the community.

<user_id=Cuchullain>
Again, please sign your posts with four tildas (~~~~). For something to be included in Wikipedia, it must be attributed to a reliable source relevant to the topic. Additionally, we give more weight to stronger sources, and less or no weight to weak sources. Peter Stanford isn't a historian. He describes himself as a ""writer, journalist and broadcaster"". He's got an impressive output but he's got no credentials in history, medieval studies, or some other relevant field, and his works don't appear to be well regarded by the experts in the field. I already mentioned the ''Speculum'' review; Thomas F. X. Noble's review in ''The Catholic Historical Review'' (October 1999, Vol. 85, No. 4) is also very critical. Those are just two I found at my library.
Exceptional claims require exceptional sources. Considering that all the other sources by historians speak to a consensus that Joan was a myth, Stanford's claim that she may have been real is exceptional. But his book is not an exceptional source. /

<user_id=Cuchullain>
Sources must be reliable for the topic at hand for their viewpoint to be included. Stanford has no credentials in history or medieval studies, his book is pop history, and it's not regarded by other scholars in the field. It's probably worth a mention in the article body, but we shouldn't change the introduction based on his book. /

In response to this, like Diana Cross, Peter Stanford isn't a historian. He's a journalist, and his book is not well regarded by others in the field. As I said above, it was harshly reviewed by John C. Moore in ''Speculum'' (July 2000, Vol. 75, No. 3, pp. 726-727). The sources by actual scholars speak to a consensus that the story is a myth. Allain Boureau's standard work on the topic is called ''The Myth of Pope Joan'', for crying out loud. Claims that stating this fact is somehow ""Catholic propaganda"" are baseless and inappropriate. /

<user_id=189.8.107.196>
Oh, I love the irony: if you google ""expert on Pope Joan"", all (and I mean it in the dictionary sense of the word ""all"", not in the usage of this article, where it is used to mean ""almost all"") and every single result that shows up on Google refers to Peter Stanford, and exclusively to him. Not one mention to all the putative serious  ""experts on the topic"", only and exclusively mentions to whom the article deliberately chooses to ignore. The more we dig it, the more clearly it gets that there is strong bias in this article's writing and editions.

<user_id=Dr.K.>
I agree, but the anon keeps reverting.  

<user_id=189.8.107.196>
What you just said is incorrect. Google the term including the quotation marks, ""expert on Pope Joan"", with both quotation marks at the beginning and at the end, and you'll see that every and all results that exist in Google refer to Peter Stanford. The customization only regards the order of the results, not what results show up, in such a case when there is such a limited number of results. Anyway, your statement will only be helpful - I ask all users who come here to try googling the phrase including quotation marks and see which statement is true.

<user_id=Scolaire>
I agree that the IP has caused an amount of disruption, and I appreciate that hackles have been raised as a result. But let's remember that he or she is a newbie. We do have to allow a certain amount of latitude, while at the same time getting the message across that edit-warring is unacceptable. We also have to ask ourselves, is there any merit in his or her case? Having read the article, and looked at some of the edits that were reverted, I believe it does have some merit. The question that is being answered in the article – and it is reflected in the title of this thread – is whether there is today a ''scholarly consensus'' in favour of her existence, but it is reasonable and right also to ask the question, are there people in the 21st century that give the idea credence? Thus, we have Peter Stanford, a reputable writer, Donna Cross, a novelist notable enough to be reported by ABC News, and the ''Daily Mail'', a well-known British tabloid, all saying they believe she existed, at least on some level. Stanford is included in the ""Modern analysis and critique"" section, Cross's opinion is not mentioned and she is relegated to the ""In fiction"" section, and the ''Mail'' is rejected out of hand. I think that both WP:NPOV and WP:DUE are consistent with including all three in the article, and I think there would be no harm in reflecting that in the lead. For instance, the last sentence might be re-written to say something like, ""Pope Joan is now widely accepted to be fictional. Nonetheless, the legend remains influential in art, literature, drama, and film, [Rustici, 2006] and a small number of 21st-century writers and journalists have expressed the belief that the legend is at least partially true.""

<user_id=Farsight001>
But none of those people are actually reliable sources for the subject.  None of them are scholars of history.  We don't typically cite non-experts as sources for information on a subject.  And a tabloid?  Almost NEVER useful.
Also, regarding NPOV and DUE - I would point to those policies as evidence that these sources should NOT be included.  NPOV does not mean that we have no point of view, but that the article reflects the point of view of the RELEVANT experts.  These people listed here saying Joan was real are NOT relevant experts.  The idea is fringe, and as policy states, fringe ideas should NOT be included because they are fringe - even if a relevant scholar or two espouses them.

<user_id=Farsight001>
Due is also clear that fringe ideas should not be included at all.  These people are clearly fringe.

<user_id=Scolaire>
You seem to have misread what I wrote (it ''was'' a bit wordy so that is forgivable). I don't propose to cite any of them as evidence that she existed; I propose to cite all of them as evidence that there are people of some consequence in the world today who ''say they believe the legend'', at least to some extent. WP:DUE says, ""Specifically, it should always be clear which parts of the text describe the minority view."" I think my proposal makes it crystal clear, and that is why I said it is consistent with policy.

<user_id=Farsight001>
Fringe is not relevant to their fame.  It is relevant to the popularity of the idea they are espousing and their expertise on the subject.  Newspaper editors and novelists are no more experts on the subject of a mythical thousand year old female pope than a 5th grader is.

<user_id=Farsight001>
And I have a problem with it because, as I already pointed out, fringe ideas merit NO mention in articles.

<user_id=Scolaire>
They are clearly ''not'' fringe. One is a newspaper editor, one is a novelist who carefully researched her subject, and the third is a newspaper with a wide circulation. They are a minority, but in no way can they be classed with flat-earth theorists or 9/11 Truthers. Anyway, why do you have such a problem with adding a short half-sentence to say that there are people that differ from the ""scholarly consensus""?

<user_id=Scolaire>
And please indent properly. I took considerable trouble already to make this section legible.

<user_id=Scolaire>
Well, I'm not going to continue arguing in circles. I've said my piece and I've nothing to add.
Thank you very much for all your sensible (and much needed) inputs, Scolaire.

<user_id=189.8.107.196>
Thank you very much for all your sensible (and much needed) inputs, Scolaire. One observation: as you have correctly stated, ""Stanford is included in the 'Modern analysis and critique"" section'"", indeed, but please note that any mention to him at all has only been there since yesterday, only because I dared putting him back there in clear ""defiance"" of literal threats by the above user's, who threatened to ban me if I insisted on inserting non-Catholic POV in the article.
Also, I do agree with you that it is pointless arguing on a bilateral way with said user - who, as you can see in his own Talk Page, has received almost complaints and warnings and feedback from almost one hundred different users, almost every single one of them complaining about the fact that said user will censor out every single bit of information that does not suit the officialist POV of the Roman Catholic Church. Therefore it is a waste of time trying to reach a consensus or an unbiased solution with said user (and the other couple of his supportes whose only jobs at Wikipedia are deffending one specific point of view across all articles - that being the Vatican's POV), especially while trying to write an article on a religious historian who raises doubts about the Roman Catholic Church's official position on a controversial topic, such as this one. Thankfully, Wikipedia's official standards are not subject to censorship and official propaganda of any kind.

<user_id=Kansas Bear>
Farsight is correct. It would appear the ''Daily Mail'' article was written by Stanford, thus the same unreliable ""source"". The ABC article quotes one historian, ""''Valerie Hotchkiss, a professor of medieval studies at Southern Methodist University in Texas, says that the story of Pope Joan was actually added to Martin Polonus' manuscript after he died''. Which negates Polonus' as a source. Consequently, no modern historian is quoted stating there was a Pope Joan, just a former nun, Mary Malone and a novelist Donna Cross. The ABC article does not appear to have any reliable sources stating Pope Joan existed and tries to take primary sources, heresay, and innuendo to build a case, but without comments from modern historians, it's not a viable source.

<user_id=Kansas Bear>
I guess we all know why the ABC article did not quote Tolomeo of Lucca who said, ""''All whom I surveyed except Martinus(Martin Polonus), relate that Benedict III was after Leo IV''"".

",1,"The discussion revolves around the inclusion of certain sources and viewpoints in a Wikipedia article about a historical figure, Pope Joan, whose existence is debated. The main points of contention are the reliability of sources, the definition of scholarly consensus, and the representation of minority viewpoints in the article.

Arguments for inclusion of certain sources:
- Some participants argue that Peter Stanford and others who believe in the existence of Pope Joan should be included in the article to represent a minority viewpoint.
- They argue that not all sources need to be from historians, as journalists and other academics can also provide valuable insights.
- They suggest that the neutrality of the article is at stake if it does not represent all viewpoints.

Arguments against inclusion of certain sources:
- Other participants argue that the sources in question are not reliable for the subject matter, as they are not historians or recognized experts in the field.
- They emphasize that Wikipedia's standards require exceptional claims to be supported by exceptional sources, which they argue is not the case with the sources proposed for inclusion.
- They point out that fringe theories should not be given undue weight in the article, and that the scholarly consensus is that Pope Joan is a myth.

Quality of arguments:
- The arguments against inclusion are generally well-supported by Wikipedia's policies on reliable sourcing and due weight, which are relevant to the discussion.
- The arguments for inclusion, while well-intentioned in seeking to present a balanced view, do not adequately address the need for sources to be reliable and recognized experts in the field.
- The discussion includes some personal attacks and accusations of bias, which detract from the overall quality of the argumentation.

Overall, the discussion demonstrates a mix of strong policy-based reasoning and less rigorous appeals to balance without sufficient consideration of source reliability. The participants who argue against inclusion provide more references to Wikipedia's guidelines and policies, which strengthens their position. However, the discussion is marred by some participants' failure to engage constructively and resorting to personal attacks.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

<user_id=BeenAroundAWhile>
I removed this section because it did not cite its sources. There was some good stuff in there, but this article already suffers severely from lack of sources, and there is no sense in adding even more information which may or may not be tru (but there is no way to check). Sincerely,

<user_id=Will Beback>
No way to check? The fact that Villaraigosa is the first Latino mayor since statehood is widely-cited. The Zoot Suit riots are the subject of articles, books, and even a movie. The demographic and protery shifts following statehood are also well-known. I agree that the article needs more sources, and even  a complete overhaul, but deleting undisputed information may not the be the best way to improve the article. This material was never even tagged for sources.

<user_id=BeenAroundAWhile>
It's up to the editor or author who submits material to cite the sources up front, rather than be goaded into it, right? Maybe I have the drill wrong, but that is my understanding. We editors shouldn't have to clean up after unverified material is inserted into our encyclopedia. Anyway, that's my opinion. Am I wrong in this? Yours,

<user_id=Will Beback>
The aim here is to create an encyclopedia. These aren't weird or extraordinary assertions. Do you dispute any of them? Have you made any effort to verify them? Why did you pick that section to delete when the rest of the article doesn't have sources either?  I think it would be better to ask for help to improve the article rather than taking just deleting random material that doesn't have a citation. If the problem is too few sources then more sources are the answer, not deleting important events. Does that make sense?

<user_id=Agtaz>
I had to step in because GL had removed some material that might have been true in other sections as well.

<user_id=BeenAroundAWhile>
Thanks for your posting, Will_Beback, but the policy of Wikipedia is quite clear: The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true. Editors should provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or the material may be removed. To me, this means that ''the editor who added the material in the first place'' should be the one to provide the source (since he or she presumably has access to it or he wouldn't have added the info). It's not for the guy coming along afterward to clean up the mess. As for removing this section, I reverted it as soon as I noticed it on my watch list. There is some good material in it, some specious and tendentious stuff, but it must all be sourced. I trust you will agree with me on that latter anyway. Who was it that added this section? He or she should be willing to back up everything in here with a citation per WP policy. ""Can't we all get along"" in attempting to improve, not depreciate, this article about our fair city? Pretty firm on this, I remain, yours sincerely,

<user_id=Agtaz>
If you're going to delete that section, you might as well remove the other sections relating to race.

<user_id=Will Beback>
It took some searching, but I found the origin of this material. It was added five years ago. Perhaps some folks weren't here then- back in those days very few inline references were added. In any case, it's been here for five years, with several fine editors copyediting or moving it, implictly endorsing its contents. If there's a specific part that is challenged then we can deal with that. There's no need to delete the parts that aren't challenged.

<user_id=BeenAroundAWhile>
Thanks, Will_Beback, for your attention to detail. As for Agtax's snide comment, the less said the better. I will go through the section and attempt to find sources for the good parts, and I invite others to do the same. I recommend Leonard and Dale Pitts' ''Los Angeles From  A to Z'' as a good source. Unfortunately, in the haste of moving from L.A. to Frazier Park a few months ago I gave away my copy and have just now ordered another one from Amazon.com. When it arrives I'll get to work on making the fixes; in the meantime I have no objection to restoring the section. Yours sincerely,

<user_id=BeenAroundAWhile>
Oh, and thanks for writing  to the original author of the section in question.

<user_id=BeenAroundAWhile>
I tried to find sources for the first statement of the section (that there were 200,000 Chicanos in L.A. in 1930) but could not do so. In 1930, foreign-born residents amounted to 15% of L.A.'s population, and in that year ""Mexicans"" were reclassified as ""whites."" This section, like others in this article, needs a lot of cleanup, so I added the extant tag thereto. Sincerely,

<user_id=Will Beback>
The original editor replied that some of the material came from ""Carey McWilliams' histories of California"".

<user_id=Will Beback>
It may have been:
'North from Mexico; the Spanish-speaking people of the United States.'' New York, Greenwood Press, 1968 [©1948]
It looks a bit old, but presumably accurate even so. There are a bunch of copies in my local library system; I'll see if I can get a copy.

<user_id=BeenAroundAWhile>
The original editor also replied that most of his submission came from an organization he belongs to, the National Lawyers Guild, which is not an unbiased source, even though it does very fine work. Mind you, I have done volunteer service for that guild (monitoring the Demo convention in L.A.); it is an activist organization, and you can tell so from the original wording of the section in question. Sincerely,

<user_id=Will Beback>
Yes, that's where he said he got the pamphlet, which he thought came at least partly from the Williams book. If we can find the facts in that book then we can source the assertions to it directly, bypassing the ""middleman"". Some of the info, like the mayor being the first Latino, we chould be able to find in the L.A.T. archive or newer history books.

<user_id=Agtaz>
It would appear that the rest of the sections after the Chicano section have been deleted as well. From going through the edits on this article, why is there so much debate on this section?

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Citation and Verifiability**: User BeenAroundAWhile emphasizes the Wikipedia policy that all information should be verifiable and sourced, which is a strong argument for maintaining the integrity of the encyclopedia. This is a valid point and aligns with Wikipedia's guidelines.

2. **Removal of Unsourced Material**: User BeenAroundAWhile removed a section due to lack of sources. This is a common practice on Wikipedia to ensure information reliability, although it can be seen as drastic if the information is widely known and could easily be sourced.

3. **Challenge of Widely Known Facts**: User Will Beback argues that the removed information is widely known and can be easily sourced. This suggests that while the policy of verifiability is important, there should be some flexibility in handling information that is common knowledge. This is a reasonable counterpoint, suggesting a more nuanced approach to sourcing could be beneficial.

4. **Effort to Verify**: User Will Beback also questions whether any effort was made to verify the information before deletion. This is a fair point, as it is part of the editorial responsibility to attempt to verify information, especially if it is widely known or easily verifiable.

5. **Selective Deletion**: User Will Beback questions the selective nature of the deletion, which is a valid concern as it may indicate inconsistency in applying the verifiability standard across the article.

6. **Improving vs. Deleting**: User Will Beback suggests that adding sources is a better approach than deleting material, especially if the material is not disputed. This is a constructive approach that aligns with the goal of improving Wikipedia.

7. **Responsibility for Sourcing**: User BeenAroundAWhile maintains that the responsibility for providing sources lies with the editor who adds the material. This is consistent with Wikipedia's guidelines, but it does not address the collaborative nature of Wikipedia, where multiple editors often work together to improve articles.

8. **Research and Collaboration**: User Will Beback demonstrates a willingness to research and find sources for the material in question, which is a positive and collaborative approach to resolving the issue.

9. **Bias and Reliability**: User BeenAroundAWhile points out that the original editor's source, the National Lawyers Guild, may be biased. This is an important consideration in evaluating the reliability of sources.

10. **Historical Context**: User Will Beback suggests using older sources that may still be accurate, showing an understanding of historical research and the value of older publications.

Overall, the discussion demonstrates a mix of adherence to Wikipedia's policies, a willingness to research and improve the article, and a consideration of the collaborative nature of Wikipedia editing. The arguments presented are generally well-reasoned, with a focus on improving the article's accuracy and reliability.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Kosovo is to compete as a sovereign state at the Olympics, this isn't a dispute, it is a fact.

The note isn't required as this isn't a political article and NPOV isn't being violated by referring to Kosovo as Kosovo, nor is NPOV being violated by saying that Kosovo will participate at the Olympics. The note violates WP:UNDUE as it gives undue weight to a political dispute on a sport article. We don't have a note on Taiwan or Palestine competing at the Olympics do we? Also please use the proper WP:RM process when wanting to move an article, I'll report next time a page is moved unilaterally. Also let me remind you both of WP:3RR and WP:CONSENSUS.

'""you don't even know what you are talking about""'' is a non-argument, good luck with your future edits on wikipedia.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User PjeterPeter argues that Kosovo should be recognized as an independent nation in the context of the Olympic Games, as it has been recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). This argument is based on the premise that sports pages should remain apolitical and that the IOC's recognition should be sufficient for the purposes of the Olympic Games.

2. User Qwerty786 challenges this by asking for proof that Kosovo is no longer a disputed nation and that Serbia has recognized Kosovo's independence. This argument seems to conflate the political recognition of a state with the criteria used by the IOC for Olympic participation.

3. User PjeterPeter responds by stating that Kosovo is recognized by a significant number of UN countries and is participating as an independent country, not as a disputed territory. This argument is based on the factual status of international recognition and the specific context of the Olympics.

4. User Qwerty786 continues to demand proof that Kosovo is not disputed, which seems to ignore the context of the Olympic Games and the authority of the IOC in determining participants.

5. User IJA intervenes, pointing out that the participation of Kosovo as a sovereign state in the Olympics is a fact recognized by the IOC and that the Wikipedia Manual of Style for Kosovo-related articles is only a proposed policy, not binding. This argument is based on the distinction between political disputes and the context of the Olympics, as well as Wikipedia's guidelines.

6. User Qwerty786 brings up the example of Chinese Taipei at the Olympics to argue for consistency in explaining naming conventions. This argument attempts to draw a parallel between the situations of Kosovo and Taiwan, although the circumstances and international recognition differ.

7. User IJA threatens a ban for disruptive actions, which is a procedural argument rather than one based on the content of the discussion.

8. User Qwerty786 accuses IJA of ignorance, which is an ad hominem attack and does not contribute constructively to the discussion.

9. User IJA dismisses Qwerty786's comment as a non-argument and focuses on the future of editing rather than the issue at hand.

Overall, the discussion includes some factual arguments regarding the status of Kosovo in the context of the Olympics and the authority of the IOC. However, there are also instances of conflating political recognition with sports participation criteria, demands for proof that are not directly relevant to the Olympic context, and personal attacks that do not contribute to the quality of the discussion. The constructive arguments are somewhat overshadowed by the disruptive elements and lack of focus on the specific issue of Olympic participation.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 4.5",4.5
"<user_id=Novidmarana>
There are many studies out there that try to measure the number of uninsured, with widly varying conclusions. Defining underinsured is inherently subjective and thus all estimates will vary with the concrete defintion of uninsured that is employed by the study. A Meta-analysis of studies is ""How Much Health Insurance Is Enough? Revisiting the Concept of Underinsurance"", Medical Care Research and Review, Vol. 63, No. 6, 663-700 (2006), DOI: 10.1177/1077558706293634. They find that estimates of the percentag of uninsured range between 2.9% and 53%, all depending on the definition and the methodology of the study (thus also making it hard to compare all the numbers from all the different studies). Citing only one study, especially one yielding an estimate that is in the higher range of estimates, is rather unbalanced and POV. See also WP:RS, quote:
Studies relating to complex and abstruse fields, such as medicine, are less definitive. Avoid undue weight when using single studies in such fields. Meta-analyses, textbooks, and scholarly review articles are preferred to provide proper context, where available.

<user_id=Novidmarana>
Number of uninsured

<user_id=DocKino>
It's time to call an end to your tendentious campaign against addressing this issue. The current statement is not backed by ""random newspaper clippings"", as your disingenuous edit summary claims. It is supported by two articles from the country's leading daily newspaper, describing three major studies whose findings have been released in the last four-and-a-half months. There is no reasonable basis for your POV tag, and it has been eliminated.

<user_id=Novidmarana>
Excuse me? I pointed you to a meta-study, which according to WP:RS is preferable to random newspaper clippings. And this meta-study show that your cherry-picked studies are not representative, like it or not. And the sentence ""Millions of insured Americans also have difficulty meeting medical costs."" is not very informative anyway, because it does not say anything about how many Americans are affected (2 million? 200 million?), and even worse difficulty meeting medical costs is something completely subjective.
And tendentious campaign? Really, maybe I could say the same about you and you repeated insertion of POV material that contradicts academic meta-studies. Please address these concerns before removing the POV tag, or remove the sentence in question.

<user_id=Novidmarana>
And for further reading, quote from WP:RS: ""For information about academic topics, such as physics or ancient history, scholarly sources are preferred over news stories. Newspapers tend to misrepresent results, leaving out crucial details and reporting discoveries out of context. For example, news reports often fail to adequately report methodology, errors, risks, and costs associated with a new scientific result or medical treatment.""

<user_id=Mrzaius>
On a tangentially related note, noone owns this article - Please try to keep that in mind before issuing such dismissive comments as the first comment by DocKino above when attempting to explain a revert of an obviously good-faith edit (which, by the way, there's been rather a lot of going 'round lately). Let's keep it civil, especially when we're dealing with other established editors. That said, the tag did seem a little off the mark - It's not so much POV as it is a bad source that should be stricken, along with its data, with an explanation here when contested. Note that noone has raised any objection to the proposed edit Novidmarana, to point - Seems reasonable to me. The only thing I'd say is that the practice here of linking to popular press sources when available gives much more layman-accessible sources. If the study above has garnered any press, it'd be nice to have one well-written article ref'd as well.   ''Btw, my apologies if the above seems a touch more curt than need be - I initially read this conversation out of context, without seeing the more reasonable one above it.''

<user_id=DCGeist>
(A) The single ""meta-study"" Novidmarana keeps pushing is over two years old. References to three independent studies that have reached similar conclusions within the past six months is obviously preferable.
(B) There is nothing in Novidmarana's favored source that contradicts the statement that now appears in the article.

<user_id=DCGeist>
As a side note, Novidmarana has reasonably inquired if there are any studies surveying this issue in other developed nations. There are. The Commonwealth Fund conducts periodical multinational studies. The 2005 study surveyed six wealthy nations (US, UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Germany). The three questions on access to health care vs. cost show that the United States is the clear ""leader"" in cost/access problems. See here.—

<user_id=Novidmarana>
A) Silly statement. Not only are you completely ignoring WP:RS, you do not even seem to understand what a [[meta-study}} is. It is not me who favors this source, but WP:RS. If you would have read at the least the introduction to this meta-study you would understand that the definition of underinsured drives the result leading to estimates that range from almost zero to more than fifty percent. That these studies are newer has only one effect, that is having newer data available. The fundamental problem of defining underinsured stays. It is really time to ask to stop pushing your NYTimes newspaper clippings, and accept that we have a guideline WP:RS that clearly states that meta-studies are preferable to single studies, scholarly studies are preferable to newspaper clippings.

<user_id=Novidmarana>
B) As I said already above, the statement ""Millions of insured Americans also have difficulty meeting medical costs"" is completely uninformative as it does not tell us anything about what millions of Americans means (2 million or 200 million), and does not tell us anything what difficulty meeting medical costs means (if I have to sell my Rolls-Royce to be able to pay my medical bills is that a difficulty already?). Per WP:WEASEL we should avoid sentences such as this, especially as this sentence merely hides that there is no generally agreed number of underinsured in the US, not even close.

<user_id=Novidmarana>
Hence remove, and please argue here with Wikipedia policies and guidelines instead of your personal opinion on what we should include here and what not. And lastly, as a side note: Maybe the three questions on access to health care show that the United States has the highest percentage of complainers, but there are other questions (preventive care, prescription drugs etc) where the answers are not that clear-cut. In any case, this is a questionnaire, not a study. There is a difference, because a study attempts to correct for things such as selection bias and so on.

<user_id=Arnoutf>
No need to be aggressive, I think DCGeist was pretty reasonable. Also note that DCGeist notices that a metastudy which is more than two years old out of necessity does not contain newer sources. I think this is a good point, newer (reliable) arguments provide growing insights and are therefore more relevant. A meta study only gives the view of the investigated period (A meta-study from about AD 1450 would provide the argument the world is flat).

<user_id=Arnoutf>
I agree millions is a problematic statement; however even 1 million uninsured would be noticable. It is beyond doubt, as shown for example by DCGeist's reference, that underinsuring is a problem in the US compared to other developed countries.

<user_id=Novidmarana>
Well, I explained that all above. The fundamental problem of all these studies is defining the term underinsured. Depending on the definition a study employs you can get anything from zero to hundred percent of all insured being underinsured. That is why the meta-study shows that estimates range from 2.9 to 53 percent. The new studies add nothing to this basic problem of defining the term underinsured. They use new data, but they do not tell us how these percentage estimates would vary with using different definitions of underinsured.
Also WP:RS is clear about the use of meta-studies VS single studies and academic studies VS newspaper clippings. Two years is not very old, things change, but nothing suggests that the numbers have changed dramatically so to make a difference.
Furthermore, there is alot of doubt that underinsuring is a problem in the US compared to other developed countries, because this is not what DCGeist reference addresses. The reference is an opinion survey, not a study that addresses problems such as making numbers comparable across countries or addressing a possible selection bias. So far no study has been forthcoming that applies the same definition of underinsured across countries and makes an international comparison.
The sentence ""Even for insured Americans it is frequently difficult to meet medical costs"" gives no real information and is completely subjective. They same could be said about almost every country as no definition is given what difficult to meet medical costs means.

<user_id=Novidmarana>
Lastly, if we are at it. If we point out all those insured that have difficulty meeting their medical costs, for the sake of neutrality we should also point out all those uninsured that would have no difficulty purchasing health insurance, see Is health insurance affordable for the uninsured? respectively should also mention that a large number of those uninsured are illegal immigrants, see Immigration's Impact on The Size and Growth of The Population Lacking Health Insurance, something that is too often forgotten in international comparisons, because these ignore that illegal immigrants are not insured in most developed countries either.

<user_id=BlueSalo>
A few comments. Apparently the problem here is that there is no good and water-proof definition of what underinsured means, resulting in wildly varying estimates of the number of uninsured. That means that we should not try to hide that there is considerable disagreement on this. Choosing studies as a reference that give estimates at the higher end strikes me as very unbalanced, apart from that WP:Reliable Sources is very clear about what sources are preferred.
I am not sure whether the current statement ''for insured Americans it is frequently difficult to meet medical costs'' is a compromise or not, the problem is, as is pointed out above, that this sentence is ambiguous (because it attempts to encompass all those estimates of the number of uninsured) and thus gives no real information to the reader.

<user_id=DCGeist>
Well, like many compromises, it gives less definitive information then many of us might wish, but it still succeeds in indicating the important point—that not only noninsurance but underinsurance is a significant problem in the United States, one that—as we know—affects not only the daily lives of many Americans but political contests and public policy priorities as well.
On another point, Novidmarana's observation about the connection between the large number of uninsured and the large number of illegal immigrants in the United States is well worth considering. Unfortunately, the study he references dates from 2000 and is based on health coverage data from 1998. If we can find a more recent reference, we should look at recasting the relevant passage.—

<user_id=BlueSalo>
But then we could also write just the opposite, that is ''for insured Americans it is frequently NOT difficult to meet medical costs''. It would imply exactly the opposite, but with estimates of the number of underinsured between 2.9% and 53% (according to what was said above) this would be covered by the sources as well. If the problem of underinsurance needs to be included because of its political implications, well, then we should write that out in full, something like ''underinsurance is an important topic in the political discourse'', with good source, obviously.

<user_id=DCGeist>
For insured Americans it is frequently NOT difficult to meet medical costs? Really? We should articulate an obvious assumption like that? No. The current statement is worth including because it indicates something that is ''not'' immediately obvious. Many readers are likely to assume that possessing insurance essentially ensures (yes) that medical costs will not pose a significant problem. Our multiple, up-to-date sources indicate otherwise. The statement and the links that accompany it advance understanding. Articulating the obvious would not.—

<user_id=BlueSalo>
That is why we have WP:NPOV - the sources support both version of the statement as whether the right statement is ""insured American frequently have"" or ""frequently have NOT difficulties"" depends on what estimate one uses and depends on how one interprets the numbers (there is no clear threshold above which one says frequently and below one does not say frequently - is it 50%, 25% or 10%, who knows, that is very subjective.). So one has to choice which statement to use. I agree that one would not include ""frequently have NOT difficulties"", but logically that does not imply that one should use the other version, as this would be POV.

<user_id=BlueSalo>
It is not even clear whether our source indicate otherwise (ie all sources, not only those that made it into the newspaper this year), because with this wide range of estimates they do imply anything except that we do not know much and that there is no scholarly consensus on the definition of underinsured. In the end that is the big news, and the article would gain if we would try not to hide this uncertainty.

<user_id=Novidmarana>
Could not agree more, but I guess it is useless to repeat oneself again and again. No answer so far why we should ignore the WP:RS and prefer newspaper clippings to an academic, peer-review meta-study that establishes that there is no consensus on the significance of the problem of underinsurance. Using two studies (both not even published in a peer-review process), that give numbers at the very high end of the range of estimates is blatantly violating WP:UNDUE. The only argument forthcoming is that the meta-study is two years old (guess what, WP:RS says: The scholarly acceptance of a source can be verified by confirming that the source has entered mainstream academic discourse - the meta-study has, these two studies by advocacy groups have not). I said it above again and again, the fundamental problem of these studies is that there is no generally agreed definition of underinsurance. The new studies can add new data and could thus indicate trends. They do not establish a consensus on the definition of underinsurance, and have thus nothing to say what the scholarly consensus on the absolute number of underinsured is.
No answer so far also why we should use have a sentence that obscurs the truth that there is no scholarly consensus on the definition and the significance of underinsurance. We could phrase the sentence both ways, given the sources. Giving preference to just one version violates WP:NPOV. It was said that one version is obvious and the other is not, but that what is obvious and what is not is entirely subjective. For someone who is underinsured the current version would be obvious, to someone else the other one would be.

<user_id=DocKino>
No, what's really useless is for you to step in and think you can simply delete well-discussed, well-sourced, and broadly supported article content because you don't like it. It's useless for you to falsely claim there are only two recent studies when you know there are three. It's useless for you to frame this as a debate over what the absolute number of uninsured is when the article clearly does not address that point. It's useless for you to argue that the passage in question should be dismissed as ""entirely subjective,"" when it summarizes in plain English the common findings of three independent studies.

<user_id=Novidmarana>
You are completely unwilling to address the points I raised, substituting debate with false claims of well-discussed, well-sourced, and broadly supported. My apologies if there are three and not two studies out, but as the article clear two studies were financed by the Commonwealth fund and one by the Kaiser foundation, so in fact it seems to be that we are talking about two studies and not three here (and we are still ignoring the scholarly consensus, yay why bother with scholarly consensus if we have sources that support our personal POV). Please explain why we should only consider these three (or two?) non-peer-reviewed studies by advocacy groups (what's next American Enterprise Institute as source?), and ignore all studies that have gone through the peer-review process. Maybe because if we would do that, we could not summarize in plain the common findings anymore, because there are NO common findings.

<user_id=DocKino>
Well, it's quite clear that there are three distinct studiesone was ''undertaken'' by the Commonwealth Fund, another was undertaken by the Center for Studying Health System Change with financing from the Commonwealth Fund. And a major correction to your claims: the Commonwealth fund study was published in ''Health Affairs'', a ""''peer-reviewed journal'' that explores health policy issues of current concern"" [emphasis added]. At any rate, all three studies are respectable enough to be reported on in the business pages of the ''New York Times''. Now, you've stated that these reports have been ""cherry-picked."" Let's see about that. We currently reference two major mainstream news reports describing the findings of three studies from two or three groups, depending on your count, and released in the past four-and-a-half months. Can you point us to any studies that have been released and reported on in the past, say, twelve months that reach contradictory conclusions? If you can, you may actually have a case.

<user_id=Canada Jack>
Nope, it did went to the peer-reviewed process. Health Affairs seems to be peer-reviews, but the study was not published in Health Affairs as it is a Web exclusive. Furthermore, I have repeatedly pointed out that there is a meta-study that represent academic consensus, and following WP:RS we have to use this study, something you conveniently ignore by setting the bar at past 12 months. Two years is hardly outdated, especially as the basic problem of finding an appropriate definition of who is underinsured and who is not is the same as it was last year or the year before or ten years ago. Again, your choice of twelve months is cherry-picking, we are not talking about a meta-study that is ten or twenty or more years old, then you would have a case. And by the way, in medicine I would never trust a study that is four-and-half months old, has not been cited, has not gone through a peer-review process, has been released shortly before election day and has been released by two advocacy groups.

<user_id=Canada Jack>
And if we are at it, using uncivil edit summaries and defaming me as tendentious editor do not add at all to the discussion. I raised several points that have not been answered - in particular, that is why we should ignore the WP:RS guideline on which sources to use, and which not.

<user_id=Canada Jack>
Before everyone explodes here, why not phrase this in a manner such as  ""Some studies suggest that  even for some insured Americans, it is frequently difficult to meet medical costs, though to what extent is difficult to quantify and open to differing interpretations."" Something like that. That is if there is an agreement that this is truly a controversial issue. My two (Canadian) cents.

<user_id=Canada Jack>
Sounds better, maybe we could add something like: ""Although the number of underinsured Americans is not known, with academic studies yielding estimates from a low 2.9 to a high 53%, the subject of underinsurance frequently features in political debates."" Sources (a meta-study, and one or two newspaper articles on this subject establishing that it is a notable subject in the political debate.

<user_id=DCGeist>
Let's just try to keep it more concise, while connecting it logically to the preceding passage thus: ""The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans—estimates of which vary widely—is a major political issue."" Anyone object to that? The topical articles, Health care reform in the United States and Health insurance in the United States (to which we should add links), are the place to go into more detail.—

<user_id=BlueSalo>
I agree, although I also think that the estimates of the number of uninsured are not varying that wildly, after all whether someone has insurance or not is relatively straightforward to measure (as opposed to underinsurance).

<user_id=DCGeist>
Oh, I think in context it will be clear that the phrase ""estimates of which vary widely"" applies solely to the underinsured, as this sentence would immediately follow the passage giving hard numbers on the uninsured, thus: ""In 2005, 46.6 million Americans, 15.9% of the population, were uninsured, 5.4 million more than in 2001. The main cause of this decline is the drop in the number of Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans—estimates of which vary widely—is a major political issue.""—

<user_id=Novidmarana>
I agree with all version mentioned - something that reflect that there is no scholarly consensus on the number of uninsured, but that nevertheless it is an important part of the political debate on the US health care system.

<user_id=DCGeist>
Okay, I've made the change. Two references seem sufficient for the citation: I've added the 2006 meta-study supplied by Novidmarana and retained one of the news reports supplied by DocKino—the one that references the Commonwealth Fund study which, though it was published as a ""Web Exclusive"", in fact appear to have gone through the same ''Health Affairs'' peer-review process applied to journal submissions that appear in print. All the best, Dan.—

",0,"The discussion revolves around the issue of how to represent the number of underinsured Americans in an article, with various participants bringing up different points related to the definition of underinsurance, the age and type of studies to be used as references, and the neutrality of the statement in question.

1. **Definition of Underinsurance**: Novidmarana points out that the definition of underinsurance is subjective and that estimates of the number of underinsured Americans vary widely depending on the definition used. This is a valid point, as the lack of a standardized definition can lead to vastly different conclusions.

2. **Age and Type of Studies**: There is a debate over whether to use a meta-study from 2006 or more recent studies from the past year. DCGeist argues that newer studies are preferable, while Novidmarana and others argue that the meta-study represents a scholarly consensus and should be preferred according to Wikipedia's reliable sources guideline. This is a complex issue, as newer studies may provide updated data, but a meta-study can offer a broader overview of the research landscape.

3. **Neutrality and Representation**: Participants discuss how to phrase the statement to maintain neutrality. Novidmarana and BlueSalo argue that the current phrasing is uninformative and subjective, while DocKino defends the inclusion of the statement as it reflects the findings of recent studies. The discussion here is about balancing the representation of different viewpoints and the clarity of the information provided.

4. **Political Implications**: The political implications of underinsurance are mentioned, with suggestions to include a statement about the political debate surrounding the issue. This is a relevant point, as it contextualizes the importance of the topic beyond the numbers.

5. **Sourcing and Wikipedia Guidelines**: There is a recurring theme about adhering to Wikipedia's guidelines on reliable sources and undue weight. Participants argue over the validity and appropriateness of using newspaper articles versus academic studies. This is crucial for ensuring the credibility of the article.

6. **Compromise and Resolution**: Towards the end of the discussion, there is a move towards finding a compromise that acknowledges the variability in estimates and the political significance of the issue without delving into specifics that are contested.

Overall, the discussion is robust, with participants providing reasoned arguments and engaging with each other's points. There is a clear effort to adhere to Wikipedia's guidelines and to present information in a neutral and informative manner. The discussion also evolves towards a compromise, showing a willingness to work collaboratively.

However, there are moments of tension and some dismissive remarks, which slightly detract from the quality of the discussion. Despite this, the participants' engagement with the topic and their efforts to reach a consensus are commendable.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5.",7.5

The ""Sugar"" song article is not very large at all, and the music video article can easily be condensed and merged into the song article. I'm not seeing the need for a separate article. –''''''''''  /

Proposed merge with Sugar (music video)

''Merge''' without a doubt. Echoing the nominator here but it can very easily be merged without leaving out anything important. There was no need for the initial split. ''''''

<user_id=Gloss>
Please don't bring personal issues into this. The nominator was advised by another editor to open this discussion after the AfD was closed rather quickly. No revenge playing into this, unless you'd like to assume bad faith. ''''''

Excuse me? I assume bad faith? You are the one acting like his stalker going around his ""comments"" on other user pages how they shouldn't have closed/opened etc. discussions and supporting him. For anyone who wants to see that just let them check your ""Contributions"". —

I'm not sure where you're from, but in the U.S. calling someone a ""stalker"" is a very serious accusation, and not a word you should be throwing around so lightly. You've now used it twice. Lucky for you, I have very few feelings and a little punk who has his panties in a bunch because his article might be merged won't bother me anytime soon. But I'd suggest you refrain from using that kind of word around anyone else before you come across somebody who will put in the effort to have you blocked for it. Back to the point, this is a discussion about merging two articles, not about how much you don't like the person who proposed the merge. WP:ANI is that way if you think the nominator is out for ""revenge"". ''''''

<user_id=Tomica>
I meant a Wikipedia stalker, not a person/child/woman stalker. Wherever you from it's easy to understand the context [duh!]. As per the other part of the comment, I can express my opinion wherever I want, and I still think WP:REVENGE applies here. —

<user_id=Petergriffin9901>
''Merge''' per both above. Honestly Tomica, it sounds like you're incredibly attached to this article and it comes off very biased. Perhaps instead of attacking Gloss, you should chill and sit this one out.  •

<user_id=HĐ>
''Merge''' – There are ''very'' few music videos that can be considered notable and have their standout articles (such as ""Gangnam Style"" and ""We Found Love"" – both of which have achieved numerous awards and gained a huge number of views on video-sharing websites). Compared to the aforementioned articles, I personally don't think that the video for ""Sugar"" can have its stand-alone article.

<user_id=Calvin999>
To be fair though, those two videos have been out for several years, so thy are bound to have more views on VEVO than a few weeks old video.  — 

<user_id=Arre 9>
''Oppose''' per Calvin999's comments. The music video is notable enough to warrant its own article, and everything in the article itself is noteworthy. The video is sort of unconventional compared to the norm, and it is what seems to have propelled the song's performance. —

<user_id=Wikimandia>
''Merge''' - this article is ridiculously long, particularly the introduction! I thought at first this was the entire article! LOL. Unless a video is somehow historical or notable in some way, I don't see how it's justified for it to be a separate article. Especially where you could watch the video five times in the time it takes to read the article.

<user_id=Tomica>
Longevity is actually '''why''' this article '''exists'''. A video doesn't need to be historic to have its own article. It has been a month since this video has been released, it had so many social media attractions (memes, controversies etc etc), 100+ million views on YouTube and will of course have a multiple video awards. And for your last sentence... watching the video =/= reading about how it was made. —

<user_id=Tomica>
''Oppose / Keep''' it as a separate article. It has enough material to stand at all. Also WP:REVENGE has it steps here, having the fact the history if the nominator and his stalker has given to numerous of articles I created/edited. —

<user_id=Calvin999>
''Keep / Oppose''' - To be honest, there is a lot of valuable information here. Too much for the song article and would make it far too big. I wouldn't mind seeing this stay. Remember, this is an encyclopedia, guys. Promote information, don't reduce it. This article has had more than 10,500 views in the past 30 days, so I think we can safely say that it is notable enough to stay as a lot of people are looking at it.  — 

<user_id=Calvin999>
It's not actually ridiculously long, but it's too long for the song article.  — 

<user_id=Wikimandia>
IMO it is ridiculously long. It's obsessively long. I hear your reasons Tomica but I don't see how it deserves its own article. Lots of videos are cool and popular and have guest stars and themes and get lots of views, but it doesn't mean they can't be described in a nice section of the song article. Check out Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.) - article about song and video living merrily together. This one too Dark Horse (Katy Perry song) and it had controversy as well.

<user_id=Tomica>
'It's ridiculously long'' is nowhere a reason for an article to get ''merged''. ''If'' we merge this amount of words (about how the conception started, it was planned, shot, what the video is about, how the critics accepted it, controversy etc etc) will still be in the song article [according to you still long]. And for the upper mentioned examples, I do not need to go over videos which were notable and create separate articles for them if I do not want to (I am not a fan of Perry). If there is an interested editor he can try creating one and I will not oppose for sure. Tbh, I never planned to create a video article for this one either, but I found this great interview by the director and said why not, created an article that can perfectly stay on Wikipedia.—

<user_id=Magiciandude>
''Keep''' per Tomica.

<user_id=Status>
''Oppose'''. The music video itself meets WP:GNG. There is nothing in WP:NMUSIC that sets limitations on whether or not a music video can have its own separate article, and what are the qualifications that warrant it. —   ·

<user_id=Wikimandia>
The length isn't my reason for it not deserving its own article. I was simply commentating on my initial shock at seeing the article. This is not Michael Jackson's Thriller. The point in referencing the other examples (and I thought of Katy Perry bc Dark Horse was the most watched video of 2014, and I think won best video overall at VMA) is that there is no need for them to have their own articles. If someone created them, people would promptly propose they be merged back into the song article.

<user_id=Tomica>
'It's not notable like Thriller by MJ''... Does that mean only Thriller can get a video article? Because it was parodied/influenced a lot of other music videos? Shit no. That doesn't mean the ""Sugar"" video will not be notable one day. As I said ofc it will received a lot VMA/EMA/Grammy nominations and then what? We can create an article? Btw, Best Video was ""Wrecking Ball"" by Miley Cyrus, not ""Dark Horse"". —

<user_id=Chasewc91>
There are site-wide guidelines, however, on creating multiple articles about the same subject. WP:SPINOFF was cited in the AfD, but it says that ""a section of the article is made into its own article"" only when ""an article gets long"". The song article is ''not'' long, nor would it be with a condensed version of the music video article merged into it. –''''''''''  /

<user_id=Chasewc91>
And that's where ''condensing'' comes into play. No one is suggesting this forked article be merged back in its entirety. In fact, the music video section of the song article, as of this writing, looks perfectly fine as is, with no need for an additional article. –''''''''''  /

<user_id=Tomica>
If you think that's enough, I don't think. At the end of a day this is a merge discussion (getting the content from the video article to the song article) not deleting. We are not POV-ing the opinion of a single user on Wikipedia, when here are other users who think this article '''should''' exist on itself. —

<user_id=Chasewc91>
Four other editors besides myself disagree with a separate article existing, so I'm not sure why you're trying to suggest I'm the only one who thinks that. POV refers to article content, not discussions regarding content; obviously POV is at hand on both sides and that's the point. Don't misinterpret policies. Extra details can be added from the current video article, but I don't think there's much else that needs to be merged. –''''''''''  /

<user_id=Tomica>
And yet that's your opinion. Four other editors agree with me. If this article gets merged most of the details apart of the lead [ofc] and the aftermath can go, the rest will be replaced in the Music video section. At least you should respect other users work which was done by using a reliable sources that can perfectly stay in the article. —

''And four others besides myself agree with a separate article existing.'''  — 

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Argument for Merge: The initial argument presented by <user_id=Chasewc91> is that the ""Sugar"" song article is not very large and the music video article can be condensed and merged into it. This is a practical argument based on the size and content overlap of the two articles.

2. Support for Merge: <user_id=Gloss> supports the merge, stating that it can be done without losing important information and that there was no need for the initial split. This argument is based on efficiency and redundancy.

3. Personal Conflict: The discussion takes a turn when <user_id=Tomica> accuses <user_id=Gloss> of personal bias and stalking, which <user_id=Gloss> refutes. This introduces a personal conflict into the discussion, which detracts from the quality of the argument as it moves away from the content of the articles and focuses on the editors' behavior.

4. Argument against Merge: <user_id=Tomica> and <user_id=Calvin999> argue that the music video is notable enough to warrant its own article and that merging would reduce the amount of information available. They emphasize the video's popularity and potential for awards. This argument is based on the notability and distinctiveness of the content.

5. Counterargument for Merge: <user_id=Wikimandia> argues that the length of the music video article does not justify a separate article and that other notable videos do not have separate articles. This argument is based on precedent and the idea that notability does not necessarily require a separate article.

6. Argument for Notability: <user_id=Status> argues that the music video meets general notability guidelines and that there are no specific limitations on music videos having separate articles. This argument is based on the interpretation of Wikipedia guidelines.

7. Argument for Merge based on Guidelines: <user_id=Chasewc91> cites WP:SPINOFF, which suggests that a separate article is only warranted if the original article is too long, which is not the case here. This argument is based on Wikipedia's guidelines for content organization.

Overall, the discussion includes a mix of practical arguments based on content management and guidelines, as well as arguments based on the notability and uniqueness of the music video. However, the introduction of personal conflict and accusations detracts from the overall quality of the discussion. Despite this, the participants do provide reasoned arguments both for and against the merge, referencing Wikipedia policies and the specifics of the content in question.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Article written like an advertisement

<user_id=2605:8D80:6E2:46EE:286A:BC79:6F37:4402>
Why is this article written like an advertisement? It reads like it's written by an insecure teenager trying to boast about their city. The most, the best, the biggest, widely recognized, prominent, well known, largest... I mean does no one else think this is kind of sad? I know Toronto wants to prove it's a ""world class"" city, but this is excessive. I'm not suggesting rewording the entire article, but it should be toned down, especially the four lead paragraphs. After all this is an encyclopedia not a tourism ad.

<user_id=Johnny Au>
I would like to know specific examples, as currently, it is rather neutral.  Once the ""advertisement"" parts are identified, they can be fixed and perhaps we can nominate it for good article status.   /

<user_id=50.100.252.149>
How about Revision as of by . This edits just reeks of desperation for acknowledgement. Not many cities have such desperate tones in their LEAD PARAGRAPH!

<user_id=50.100.252.149>
I proposed the lead paragraph be changed to something that doesn't sound so desperately sad, such as:
″''Toronto is the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario, Canada and is located on the northern shore of Lake Ontario. The 2016 census recorded a population of 2,731,571 and a metropolitan population of 5,928,040 making Toronto the largest city in Canada. A global city, Toronto is a centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural cities in the world.''″
Maybe removing the some of the excessive fluff will make this article lead far more encyclopedic.

<user_id=Alaney2k>
Canadian province of Ontario, Canada is not an inspiring improvement in writing. -)

<user_id=50.100.252.149>
Small typo, but thanks for missing the entire point. Good one.

<user_id=50.100.252.149>
I see that small changes were made, the lead still needs some major changes, may I suggest:
'Toronto is the capital city of the province of Ontario, Canada. An established ''(is there a non-established global city?)'' global city, Toronto is an international ''(Canadian)'' centre of business, finance, arts, and culture ''(Toronto widely criticized for lack of culture)'' and widely ''(original research)'' recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan ''(not in references)'' cities in the world. It is the most populous city in Canada, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, ''(absolutely unheard of and irrelevant outside of Ontario)'' the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2016 census recorded a population of 2,731,571. In 2015, the population was estimated at 2,826,498, ''(est. irrelevant now that 2016 census released)'' making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on city limits (behind Los Angeles), while it is the fifth-largest (behind Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area ''(widely debated stat considering CMA's and MSA's are drastically differing. Also this sentence sounds plan sad and desperate)''''
A lot of original research and peacock terms still in the lead paragraph

<user_id=Alaney2k>
After looking at comparable city articles like Chicago, it seems that the city leads seem to start with most populous, etc. For whatever reason, this is what the eds have been writing. This includes the ranking versus other cities. It's not great, but I don't think it sounds desperate either. Being in the first paragraph, it is probably too prominent. Cosmopolitan is a bit vague, maybe they were going for liberal, open, etc. I'm not sure about the criticism about culture. That seems subjective. I mean, sure I have heard complaints about culture, living here, but I don't have a sense of how to rank levels of being cultured. There are lots of galleries, live theatres, live entertainment venues, and all sorts of media located in Toronto. The criticism I've read is more of a scolding nature, intending to out some backwardness and lack of confidence in some institutions, without any historical reference. Within my lifetime, Toronto has leaped forward in a lot of areas, so I really don't feel so harsh about it.

<user_id=JPark99>
I strongly disagree with you that this article is written like an advertisement or tourism article. I and many others have worked and continue to work to improve this article along Wikipedia guidelines, and I feel that the lead of this article is written from a neutral point of view that states facts and information about Toronto backed up with strong references, and does not attempt to compare Toronto to other cities, to promote Toronto as superior to other cities, or to sway opinion. That said, I am interested to know which parts of this article you think are written like an advertisement, and how you would propose to ""tone down"" the article. Please provide specific examples.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The initial complaint by the user with the IP address 2605:8D80:6E2:46EE:286A:BC79:6F37:4402 is about the tone of the article, which they feel is written like an advertisement with excessive use of superlatives and promotional language. This is a valid concern in the context of an encyclopedia, which should aim for a neutral point of view.

2. Johnny Au asks for specific examples to address the concerns, which is a constructive approach to improving the article. This indicates a willingness to engage with the criticism and make changes if necessary.

3. The second user with the IP address 50.100.252.149 provides a revised version of the lead paragraph, aiming to make it sound less ""desperately sad"" and more encyclopedic. This is a proactive step and contributes positively to the discussion by offering a concrete solution.

4. Alaney2k's response to the proposed revision is dismissive and focuses on a minor typo rather than the substance of the proposed changes. This does not contribute constructively to the discussion.

5. The user with the IP address 50.100.252.149 continues to argue their point, providing a more detailed critique of the lead paragraph and suggesting further changes. This shows a commitment to improving the article's neutrality and encyclopedic tone.

6. Alaney2k then provides a comparison with other city articles and offers a perspective on the use of certain terms and the cultural aspect of Toronto. This adds context to the discussion and helps to understand the norms for city articles on Wikipedia.

7. JPark99 defends the current state of the article, stating that it adheres to Wikipedia guidelines and is backed by strong references. They also express openness to specific suggestions for improvement. This is a reasonable stance, assuming that the article does indeed follow the guidelines and the references support the claims made.

Overall, the discussion includes a mix of constructive criticism, specific suggestions for improvement, requests for clarification, and defense of the status quo. There is a clear effort by some participants to address the concerns raised and improve the article, while others seem less receptive to the criticism.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.0",7.0

With regards to the edit on the Vyborg-Petrozavodsk Offensive, the information is not dubious, and I have added citations to reliable sources for it. The Werth source clearly says, on page 906 as well as where the citation is, that Soviet forces had ""stopped at the 1940 Finnish fronteir, and did not go beyond it. They were giving the Finns time to reflect."" The Wright source also clearly says that they stopped voluntarily, on or slightly past the 1940 border, on page 343. ""On June 15, the Finns were forced to draw back to their final, VKT Line, which streched from Viipuri to Kurarsaari, then east along the Vorksi river to Taipale."" While I agree that this line is not across the Finnish border, it is very near it. Also, your wording on the footnote is not particularly NPOV (""shattered""?) I would question the ""unable to fulfill the orders"" quote as well, it contradicts what both my sources say.

<user_id=Joe N>
Dubious

One task, which I have found really frustrating is the fight against ignorant historians writing in English who are using solely Soviet second and third hand sources and thus repeating Soviet war-time and post-war propaganda. Even Glantz is not immune on that, as witnessed his inclusion of South-East Army to the Finnish OOB in his book about Leningrad. Finnish language is not the easiest one, but one can get a couple embarrasing moments less if one bothers to check facts from the both side sources. But to the facts on the ground...

<user_id=Whiskey>
...very near it. At the closest point at Vyborg, Soviets were about 40km from the border, at Taipale they were almost 150km from the border.
Wright is correct in stating that Finns retreated to VKT-line, but his wording confuses the fact that VKT was the final line in the sense that Finns were able to stop Soviet advance there and didn't have to retreat to the Salpa line, which was still behind VKT. And at least from the quote you gave, there is nothing about voluntary stopping of Soviets.

<user_id=Whiskey>
shattered Instead of this word, I could have used the following: ""Most of the men of those two divisions were able to escape Finnish encirclement by abandoning all their heavy equipment, artillery, trucks and mortars and fleeing through the roadless forest with their handarms. After they reached Soviet lines, they were forced to spend several months to recuperate from the losses and wounds, and before their heavy equipment were re-equipped."" Better?

<user_id=Whiskey>
unable to fulfill the orders is a direct quote from the Platonov's book, which is generally considered official Soviet military history of the Siege of Leningrad. It is supported by archive material about messages between STAVKA and Marshall Govorov, see Talk:Strategic_operations_of_the_Red_Army_in_World_War_II#Vyborg_operation_dates. It was only later, when politically correct historians started to interpret things when the idea of Soviet voluntary stopping was invented. It was just as voluntary as German stopping at Bastogne.

<user_id=Whiskey>
You should be critical about your sources and not parrot everything they say. Basically, you have two books written by British/American historians, and your interpretations of them, based on the quotes you have referred, as they seems not to say directly that Soviets stopped voluntarily. I have both Finnish (Maanpuolustuskorkeakoulu:''Jatkosodan historia 4-5'') and Soviet (Platonov et al.:''Bitva za Leningrad'') official histories and both Finnish (Sota-arkisto) and Soviet (CAMD) archival material to support my view. I'd say third hand sources vs. first and second hand sources.

<user_id=Joe N>
Oh, what rich irony. I am either criticized by mrg3105 for not using enough Soviet sources, or you for using too many. The Werth book is written by a Brit living in Moscow as the BBC corespondent during the war. Therefore, it seems that these two potential biases would cancel out and he would produce a fairly neutral book, which I have found him to have done, so far. He states twice that the Soviets stopped voluntarily, to give the Finns time to consider peace terms without using more men and supplies to continue the offensive, which was taking heavy casualties. Glantz's book When Titans Clashed also clearly says on page 202 that the Soviet Offensive went well. Regarding the shattered, I'll try to rewrite that to be better and less lengthy than what you have. And about sources - Wikipedia sources should be secondary sources, as written by historians, not primary sources interpreted by individual Wikipedians, which comes awfully close to WP:OR.

<user_id=Whiskey>
No, I don't criticize you using too many Soviet sources, in fact you are using too few. And what is even more distressing, you are using *only* Soviet sources. I believe Werth is trying to give unbiased view in his book, but as he a)relies only an information from one side of conflict and b)doesn't have all relevant information available (Platonov's book was released in the same year as Werth's), he is not able to express a balanced view. This is clearly indicated in his claim that Soviets stopped voluntarily, as it clashes against the direct STAVKA order to Govorov:""...1. To armies of the Leningrad front, acting Karelian isthmus to continue approach with a task 26-28.06.1944 the main forces to take possession a boundary Imatra, Lappenranta, Virojoki. A part of forces to attack Keksgolm, Elisenvara with the purpose of clarification from the opponent of Karelian isthmus to northeast from the river and lake Vuoksi. 2. In the further the main forces to develop approach with a task to take possession boundary Kuovola, Kotka and will be fixed on east coast (bank)of the river Kjumin-Joki. To provide the main grouping from the north..."", which was published after his book was released.
Glantz is correct in a sense that offensive went well ''until June 20''. In fact it went perfectly, just according the timetable, facing less opposition as was presumed. But then it hit to the wall. Platonov, coming from the military, and unaware of any political and ideological pressures, states:""The repeated offensive attempts by the Soviet Forces failed ... to gain results. The enemy succeeded in significantly tightening its ranks in this area and repulse all attacks of our troops ... During the offensive operations lasting over three weeks, from June 21 to mid-July, the forces of the right flank of the Leningrad front failed to carry out the tasks assigned to them on the orders of the Supreme Command issued on June 21."" The net result of this was a total amnesia among the historians: The Vyborg operation end date was set to June 20, although Leningrad front suffered more casualties in offensive operations after that date than it suffered during the previous eleven days.

<user_id=Whiskey>
Regarding the sources, the first hand sources can be used also in Wikipedia to prove exactly what they say (WP:OR#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources). In this case it is an intention of Soviets to go further than Vyborg. Then I have Platonov to do second hand interpretation of the issue:""...failed to carry out the tasks assigned to them..."" I really presume that Werth was unaware of this order, as it stretches my imagination too much how that order could be interpreted as a ""voluntary stopping"".

NPOV: Please note that
According to the European Court of Human Rights European Court of Human Rights cases on Occupation of Baltic States, the United Nations Human Rights Council , the governments of the Baltic countries, the United States, and the European Union, the Baltic states were occupied by the Soviet Union.
Therefore the use of liberation in the article is not factual, even though liberated from the German occupation ,that followed is considered Soviet Occupation according to the sources above. The only source that is in disagreement with this is the Russian government.

RE: ''the article is about a speech given by Stalin, as explained in the article. The titles of the offensives given are the ones used by Stalin''
Sorry but I don't see anything or any sources referring to this in the text that would refer to it as ""according to Stalin"". And even if this is fixed, you'd need to add the majority viewpoint to the article in order to maintain the WP:NPOV

''Comment''': ''Please note that while ""liberation"" is used here as a translation of Stalin's speech'' in what secondary published source is this translation of Stalin's speech exactly given remains unclear like it remains unclare that the text in the section is according to Stalin. I'd suggest using the appropriate WP titles for the 10 blows and then make it clear how Stalin called it instead of stating these as facts in the article.

<user_id=Joe N>
this page, linked to in the footnotes section is the source, and when it is translated into English on Google then you can see that, although the translation is imperfect, it still says, in relation to the Crimean offensive ""As a result of the attack were released from a German yoke of Crimea and Odessa"" In relation to the Offensive against the Finns, ""The result of this attack was to liberate much of the Karelian-Finnish Soviet republic."" In relation to the Belorussian Offensive (Bagration) ""took to the Neman and freed most of the Lithuanian Soviet republic."" In relation to the Lvov-Sandomierz, ""released Western Ukraine,"" for the Baltic Offensive ""a) was released Estonian Soviet Republic, b) was released most of the Latvian Soviet republic,"" and for the ninth offensive listed ""a) our troops have had direct assistance to federal Yugoslavia, we in the expulsion of Germans and the liberation of Belgrade, b) our troops were able to move through the Carpathian mountain range and to reach out to us the Federal Republic of Czechoslovakia, part of whose territory has been liberated from German invaders."" While the translation is imperfect, you can still understand the message he is conveying.   I would be willing to compromise, using the generally accepted titles for the links and stating in each paragraph the title Stalin gave it.

",0,"The discussion revolves around the interpretation of historical events, specifically the Vyborg-Petrozavodsk Offensive and the use of the term ""liberation"" in the context of Soviet military actions during World War II. The participants are debating the accuracy and neutrality of the information presented in the Wikipedia article, with particular focus on the sources used to support the claims.

User Joe N argues that the Soviet forces stopped at the 1940 Finnish frontier voluntarily, citing sources from Werth and Wright that suggest the Soviets paused to give the Finns time to consider peace terms. Joe N emphasizes the importance of using secondary sources written by historians rather than primary sources interpreted by individual Wikipedians, to avoid original research.

User Whiskey counters by suggesting that Joe N is relying too heavily on Soviet sources and not considering Finnish sources. Whiskey provides a detailed argument, referencing specific military orders and historical interpretations that suggest the Soviet advance was not voluntary but was halted due to military resistance and failure to achieve objectives. Whiskey also points out that primary sources can be used to support specific facts and that secondary sources like Platonov's work support the view that the Soviets did not stop voluntarily.

User Termer brings up the issue of neutrality and factual accuracy regarding the use of the term ""liberation,"" pointing out that according to various international bodies and governments, the Baltic states were occupied by the Soviet Union, not liberated. Termer insists on the need to reflect the majority viewpoint and to clarify that the terms used are according to Stalin's speech, not necessarily historical fact.

Joe N responds to Termer by providing a source for the translation of Stalin's speech and suggests a compromise where the generally accepted titles for the offensives are used, but Stalin's terminology is also mentioned for clarity.

Chain-of-Thoughts reasoning:

1. Joe N provides sources to support the claim of voluntary stopping by the Soviets but is challenged on the depth and variety of sources used.
2. Whiskey provides a counter-argument with detailed references to military orders and historical interpretations, suggesting a lack of voluntary stopping.
3. Termer raises concerns about neutrality and the use of the term ""liberation,"" which is a contested term in the context of Soviet actions.
4. Joe N offers a compromise to address the concerns raised by Termer, showing a willingness to adapt the article for clarity and neutrality.

The discussion is robust, with participants providing detailed arguments and counter-arguments, referencing a variety of sources, and showing a willingness to compromise. The participants are engaged in a critical examination of historical interpretations and the implications of language used in the article. The discussion reflects a high level of engagement with the subject matter and a commitment to accuracy and neutrality.

Sabiha Gokcen's identity as an ethnic Turk is highly questionable

<user_id=EtienneDolet>
Sabiha Gokcen's identity as an ethnic Turk is highly questionable. As we already know, recent research into her ethnic background has shown that she is likely an Armenian, not a Turk. Consequently, Sabiha Gokcen may might as well belong in the Armenian people article. Therefore, in order to reduce a rather unnecessary dispute over this matter (disputes in the past similar to this resulted in a delisting of this article's GA status), I propose we swap Sabiha Gokcen picture with that of Mimar Kemaleddin or another ethnic Turk.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
The ibox isn't about people that have the Turkish cizizenship, but about the ethnic group, like the rest of the article.

<user_id=Maurice Flesier>
As ı said earlier, it's just a claim. There is no concrete evidence in this regard,except for a few newspaper headlines. See: WP:SOURCE. In 2004, armenian citizen Hripsime Gazalyan claimed that Gökçen her own aunt and the real name was Hatun Sebilciyan. Her sister Ülkü Adatepe has denied these claims. She said tahat: The claims are baseless and had no basis. Also, Turkish Armed Forces and THK have made 

<user_id=EtienneDolet>
It's a legitimate claim adopted by Western and Turkish sources alike. There has been a long standing consensus regarding this issue on this and of Sabiha Gokcen's article. The source's you provide aren't even academic and are seemingly guided by nationalist sympathies of the Turkish Republic, its government, and its cohorts. The Turkish government may say a lot of things, that doesn't mean it should be accepted outright. Therefore, to avoid continuing this endless debate and discussion, I think swapping Sabiha Gokcen for another ethnic Turk is a good proposal. What's so wrong about that? Mimar Kemaleddin's picture is nice as well. There are dozens of other ethnic Turks that deserve to be up there. Do you really want to continue arguing this for ages? Besides, as far as I can see from Rumi's article, there's a consensus on his article that he is Persian. Al-Farabi doesn't appear in the Iranian peoples article.

<user_id=KazekageTR>
, i agree that she is not Turkish origin, but these sources are not solid enough, not facts just claims though. The 'offical' sources indicates that she is a Turks (like TSK, THK etc.)

<user_id=KazekageTR>
Our point is to put Turkish women mainly to this infobox. Cause as you can notice there are not that much important Turkish women in our history. But if you find reliable sources like her own statements or DNA results etc. we will remove her from infobox, until then i insist for her presence.

<user_id=EtienneDolet>
There's no ""official"" discourse on her identity. We go by what the research says. Just because the Turkish government says that she's Turkish doesn't mean she is one. If the German government says the Holocaust didn't happen, should we abide by those rules here as well? No. It doesn't work that way. Her Armenian racial identity is a major controversy in Turkey but it's an accepted fact under western scholarship and we have more than enough sources to attest to this. So instead of arguing and bickering, I suggest a simple swap of people. If not, I will take this to WP:DR for more community involvement.

<user_id=KazekageTR>
Well then why don we just go to WP:DR for all those people. As you know except Osman and Orhan, mothers of the Ottoman emperors are devşirme, as you know there are claims that Atatürk's father is Albanian not Turk.  The fact is Turkey was a melting pot for cultures, ethnical groups and there are no definite ancestral background scheme for anyone(well even i don't surely know my origin, my grandfather says that we hailed from Caucasus like Chveneburi or Meskhetian Turks) .

<user_id=KazekageTR>
By the way i am a strict follower of Hrant Dink's wiews(i miss his presence in this country), he published several notes on that issue, that's why i believe that Gökçen is not Turkish.  But further than that, i have nothing to say or show as a solid source. I'm passing the ball to . If he pleases to take this to WP:DR, i will be in that article too.

<user_id=EtienneDolet>
I appreciate your sincere response. Unlike Ataturk and the Devsirme's, the issue is that she is considered 100% Armenian by numerous sources as opposed to 100% Turkish by others. So her ethnicity is either black or white, there's no gray areas like Ataturk. So, if this continues, I will take this to DR if there is no third-party involvement here on this talk page.

<user_id=Maurice Flesier>
As long as there is no certainty on this issue, Gökçen's photo should stay there. WP:DR an option, no obstacle for me, unless there is an imposition, on the article of Sabiha Gökçen before WP:DR! Resources consist of newspaper clippings, not reliable WP:RS. I don't agree , no any definite and clear decision that she is an Armenian. Another important point, the person who defend this claim, does not have any concrete evidence.

<user_id=KazekageTR>
i was saying that too, we are on the same page mate. Like i said no definite evidence. Just thoughts, claims.

<user_id=Maurice Flesier>
Dear, , I propose to swap Tevfik Fikret with Abdul Hamid II. Because, currently there are five novelist on the box. Also, Fikret is not a very popular author like Nazım Hikmet,Halide Edip, Pamuk and Şafak. However, no any last term Ottoman Sultans..Abdülaziz, Mehmed V, Mehmed VI etc. I think that is the most important sultan Abdul Hamid II with 31 March incident, İkinci Meşrutiyet.. Aslında önemi bu kolaj ile daha iyi anlaşılıyor. See:

<user_id=KazekageTR>
There are lots of Ottoman sultans already, instead of replacing it with another sultan, i think we should upload images for older Turkish rulers like Tughril and Kilij Arslan I. Nasıl?

<user_id=Alexikoua>
The fact that Sabiha Gokcen's ethnicity is uncertain is a strong argument to remove her picture, not to keep her. This is definitely the infobox about ethnic Turks, not Turkish citizens of uncertain ethnicity.

<user_id=KazekageTR>
As  said; ""Rumi and Al-Farabi disputed between Turkey and Iran but they are located in Iranian people."" So can we remove them too then ?

<user_id=Alexikoua>
Each case offers a diferrent background, but I'm generally against adding personalities of complex or unclear ethnic background. As for Rumi, things seem to be clear: he was termed 'Persian' by Western sources, and of Persian family background too.

<user_id=Maurice Flesier>
Dear , What do you think about '''Ismail I''' ?? Currently, He is located in Iranian peoples, Kurdish people and Azerbaijani people infoboxes! Another exp, Saladin which nationality? Kurdish people or Iranian peoples? Arsen Kotsoyev's nationality Ossetian but he is take place Iranian peoples article together Ossetians. Besides, Carlos Slim, (richest person in the world) is Lebanese origin he has been included among Mexican people!! And Vladimir the Great, Russian or Ukrainian? and more..Sabiha Gökçen even can not subject of dispute between Armenians and Turks, while there are so many controversial figures.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
Thanks for the notice. It may be a complicated issue, but I'm in general against using people of multinational background as representatives of one ethnic group. I'm not going into further detail with this, per Wikipedia:OTHERCRAP, but maybe a general discussion is needed in the case of such iboxes.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
wp:OTHERCRAP per definition isn't a convicing argument.

<user_id=Maurice Flesier>
Sorry, but it is not a convincing explanation. I will not let in any ""fait accompli"" about Sabiha Gökçen like your vandalic edit .Gökçen's photo  uploaded 3 November 2006 but ""for some reason"", it has been nominated for deletion. And other sabotage effort, . I have to report this situation to the administrator.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
Removing non-free images can't be termed vandalistic edit. As for the arguments about keeping the person in the infobox, I would suggest to follow instructions per wp:OTHERCAP: we are discussing about the infobox of this article and so please focus on the specific discussion.

<user_id=KazekageTR>
Well thats the point mate. You could just replace her image with antoher image of hers, but you completely replaced her with another person. Thats we're saying not right and its considered to be vandalistic.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
I'm against the use of fictious protraits, as the first 2 examples: 20th century oil paintings to depict medieval 11th century personalities is something that should be avoided in such infoboxes (might be a good idea for a children's book but not for an encyclopedia).

<user_id=KazekageTR>
As you know well, all of the paintings of the kings, old noblemen, old important persons' portaits are fictious. For example
These paintings are fictious after all, if you take a look at another portrait of those people, you'll see different faces. And there are no wikipedia rules to not to use them by the way.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
It seems that not all of the above examples are exactly fictious. The portraits of Moliere & Voltaire were painted the time they lived, Peter's was based on earlier portraits, Joan of Arc's was at least painted the century she lived.
On the other hand, based on the the low quality of the unknown oil paintings in this article (A.& K. Arslan, not to mention they both lack the necessary references: author, year etc.) someone can easily assume that they were just painted for a modern children's book. Off course they have nothing to do, in terms of quality, with some other famous portraits of the infobox, like that of Suleiman and MehmetII,

<user_id=Alexikoua>
A better alternative of Arl Arslan will be this one [], in case we can find the appropriate reference here too.

<user_id=KazekageTR>
Did you get my point mate. What i'm saying is the definition of 'fictious'. It's up to painter's talent to reflect or not to reflect the reality of someones face appearances. We can assume that all of the paintings are fictious unless we got a photographic evidence. It doesnt matter whether they were painted the time they lived. It doesnt mean it reflects %100 reality.

<user_id=Alessandro57>
Fact is that one cannot exclude pivotal exponents of an ethnic group (like Alp Aslan) just because there is no known faithful representation of them. Talking about my people, Marco Polo and Christopher Columbus are two examples of famous Italians who never were portrayed during their life, but they are present on the collage indeed. Of course,  if there are no descriptive elements apt to represent faithfully someone, one is entitled to choose the best representation: in that case, I would choose the portrait which is temporally closer to the lifetime of the person in discussion.

<user_id=Calthinus>
What is a Turkified Armenian, but a Turk? Ethnicity isn't about blood. You know how many Turks would be ""Armenians"" if we were to do it by blood? A whole ton of them... Of course she's a Turk, regardless of her ancestry, because she behaves as one.

<user_id=KazekageTR>
Well fate's twist, I've removed or had to remove Sabiha Gökçen from infobox because of the copyright issues with her images. So can we remove the dispute template now? It looks bad at the top of that page.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
The dispute tag was placed long before the ibox issues and was placed due to serious issues raised about genetics and if they deserve to be mentioned in lead (...largely descend from these ancient indigenous Anatolian groups) and history section. Discussion link [].

",0,"The discussion revolves around the inclusion of Sabiha Gokcen's image in an infobox related to ethnic Turks. The main point of contention is whether Gokcen's Armenian heritage disqualifies her from being represented as an ethnic Turk. The participants present various arguments, sources, and analogies to support their positions.

1. **Ethnicity vs. Nationality**: The debate starts with the distinction between citizenship and ethnicity. User EtienneDolet argues that Gokcen's Armenian heritage makes her inclusion in the ethnic Turks infobox questionable. User Alexikoua supports this by emphasizing the focus on ethnicity rather than citizenship.

2. **Sources and Evidence**: User Maurice Flesier and User KazekageTR point out that the claims about Gokcen's Armenian heritage are not substantiated by concrete evidence, relying on the principle of WP:SOURCE from Wikipedia's guidelines. They argue that official Turkish sources identify her as Turkish.

3. **Precedents and Consistency**: The discussion touches on other historical figures with complex ethnic backgrounds, such as Rumi and Al-Farabi, and how they are represented in Wikipedia articles. User Alexikoua argues for consistency and against including personalities with unclear ethnic backgrounds.

4. **Nationalist Bias**: User EtienneDolet raises concerns about potential nationalist bias in the sources defending Gokcen's Turkish identity. This is countered by the argument that there is no definitive proof of her Armenian identity.

5. **Historical Figures Representation**: The conversation shifts to the representation of historical figures without contemporary portraits. Users debate the appropriateness of using later artistic representations in infoboxes. User Alessandro57 suggests using the best available representation, ideally one closest to the person's lifetime.

6. **Ethnic Identity**: User Calthinus introduces the idea that ethnicity is not solely about ancestry but also about cultural identity and self-identification, suggesting that Gokcen's self-identification as a Turk is what matters.

7. **Resolution and Focus**: The discussion concludes with the removal of Gokcen's image due to copyright issues, which shifts the focus away from the ethnic identity debate. User Alexikoua reminds the group that the dispute tag was related to broader issues in the article, not just the infobox.

Throughout the discussion, participants use a mix of Wikipedia policies, historical context, and logical reasoning to argue their points. The dialogue is generally respectful and focused on the topic, with users providing evidence and counterarguments. However, there are moments where the discussion veers into less productive territory, such as when User Maurice Flesier accuses another user of a ""vandalic edit,"" which could be seen as a personal attack rather than a constructive contribution.

Overall, the discussion is robust, with participants engaging with the topic in depth and bringing various perspectives to the table. The quality of the arguments varies, with some users providing more substantiated claims than others. The discussion could benefit from a more structured approach to evaluating evidence and a clearer consensus-building process.

. Thanks for coming to the talk page with this. Since I twice reverted your contribution, I want to make it very clear why I did so. This has little to do with the content you have tried to add and a lot to do with what is important in the way things are added to Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a place where anyone can simply add their favorite piece of information ... if that were allowed we would be no better than an electronic bulletin board. In order to make Wikipedia a reliable source of information, everything that is added should come from a reliable secondary source (see WP:SOURCES). Part of the job of editors is to evaluate the sources that are provided to make sure that they are of high enough quality, and another role that editors play is making sure that a source actually says what is claimed. When these issues are questioned, the editors who are interested in the topic need to agree (by consensus) on the validity of the sources. Finding good sources takes some work and you shouldn't get discouraged if you missed the mark at first. If, as you say, there are good sources for the information you wish to add, then I, and I am sure other editors as well, will be only too glad to help in getting this statement into the article.

hello there
ive tried to add a very important piece of information about the early stages of the function concept but it was reverted.
at the section of Functions before the 17th century, there are various, extended and well-documented sources about the work of Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī of being the first
to form the first concept of a function on his analysis of the equation x3+d=bx2.he was first to use an '''if''' term and the relation of the function result according to a
given variable.if there are any mathematicians here that are familiar with his work i would be glad to get some feedback on this subject.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

As I said, finding good references is difficult. Your first two are high school course notes and the comment has been copied from somewhere without attribution. These are not scholarly works. The third[2] and sixth[5] are wikis, and no wiki, including Wikipedia, is considered a reliable source. The fourth[3] is a scholarly paper that, as far as I can tell, has never been published. The publishing process is important since that says that the material has been examined by other scholars and found to be valid. Unpublished work is lacking this validation and so, remains unreliable. This reference, as well as the book reference[4], do not support the claim you are trying to make. They are both arguing that he developed the derivative concept, not the function concept. This theory is disputed by several math historians (some of these are even referenced in the book quoted). Having said all of that, there is a possibility. The Wikipedia article cites a book by Katz and Barton. Katz is a well-known math historian. That book ''may'' contain the reference you are looking for. I do not have a copy and I can't tell from the Wikipedia article if they actually make this claim, but this would be a good place to try to find what you are looking for.

<user_id=Roneln>
.hi bill, so if a statement was approved once by Wikipedia community, it should be approved again? I mean if a piece of information is valid in one article it's not valid in another? shouldn't information validity be Global at the Wikipedia realm?

This is not an issue of a citation being good in one place and not good in another. The problem is that I can not determine from what is written what the scope of the citation is. Does it apply to the entire paragraph, a portion of the paragraph or just to the claim that it is attached to? There are several claims made in this paragraph, so what the scope of the citation is is a crucial issue. Notice that in other paragraphs of that history section, each claim made has a citation attached, even if it is the same citation for several claims. Without actually looking at the source, I can't tell what is supported and what isn't.

ok I've found the article here.this is the work that was used to cite the statement of sharaf al tusi to be the first to develop the function concept in the history of algebra article.it is very clear according to katz that tusi laid the first elements of a function but no one has ever continued his work.

<user_id=Wcherowi>
Thank you for that. I do not think that this article supports the claim that Tusi developed the function concept. There are three reasons that have led me to this conclusion. Firstly, when Katz refers to functions in relation to Tusi's work, he always puts the term in quotes. In this context the quotes would indicate that the term is not quite right, probably anachronistic. Later in the paper Katz says that the function concept is much more abstract than the simple solving of equations, which is what Tusi is doing. Finally, Katz's co-author, in yet another section of the paper, describes the history of the term ""function"" and how its meaning had changed over the years. Tusi is not mentioned here. I would say that the best statement that this source supports is that some rudimentary understanding of the function concept can be inferred from Tusi's work, but this was not expanded or built upon.

<user_id=Roneln>
of course,and i agree.since the work of sharaf al Tusi and another mathematician work named al Bruni the concept of the function has been developed immensely, by content and applications.katz does state that al sharaf used the 'function' because the term didnt exist back then and sharaf himself made a really brand new approach to this subjuct that he yet to even name it.but that doesnt mean one can passover his very important discovery and contribution, it is there, explained by process and proved by numbers.there is a clear use of a function form, in a very clear way. and to disregard it, in the history of function concept is really to disregard facts.i really think that if experienced mathematician made a clear recognition and analysis of this statement, comparing it to modern functions and function interface, he would agree you have to credit sharaf al din for his contribution.every concept starts with one point and than geeting developed.you asked me to bring you the data cited at the history of algebra article regarding Sharaf al din.if its not backed up,dont you think you should remove it from that article as well?

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Wcherowi's Argument Quality:
   - Wcherowi emphasizes the importance of reliable secondary sources for Wikipedia content, which is in line with Wikipedia's content guidelines.
   - The user explains the reasons for reverting the edits clearly and provides guidance on what constitutes a reliable source.
   - Wcherowi distinguishes between different types of sources and their reliability, such as the difference between published scholarly work and unpublished work.
   - The user also points out the importance of consensus among editors and the need for sources to directly support the claims made.
   - Wcherowi suggests a potentially valid source (the book by Katz and Barton) and encourages further investigation, showing a constructive approach to resolving the issue.

2. User Roneln's Argument Quality:
   - Roneln asserts the importance of Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī's work in the development of the function concept, which is a relevant topic for the article in question.
   - The user attempts to provide sources to back up the claim but fails to meet Wikipedia's standards for reliable sources.
   - Roneln shows persistence in trying to validate the edit by referring to a source that is cited in another Wikipedia article, which demonstrates an effort to find consensus.
   - The user argues that the contribution of Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī should not be disregarded, which is a valid point if supported by reliable sources.
   - Roneln raises a question about the consistency of information across Wikipedia articles, which is a legitimate concern for the platform's credibility.

Overall, both users are engaged in a constructive dialogue, with Wcherowi providing clear guidelines and Roneln showing a willingness to understand and adhere to Wikipedia's standards. The discussion is focused on the validity of sources and the appropriate representation of historical facts, which is central to the integrity of Wikipedia content.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.0",8.0

Canada PM in lead

<user_id=DBigXray>
The statement of Canada PM is added in lead as it is an important declaration of the National Policy and Canada's view point of this movement. please check WP:WEIGHT and WP:LEAD. That fact that it is there in the article body below is not enough justification to remove it from the Lead which is a short summary of the article. ''''

<user_id=Elephanthunter>
It wasn't a statement of national policy so much as an assurance to Singh himself, who had repeatedly accused Canada of supporting the Khalistan movement. We can have it in the lede under two conditions: 1) In the context of said accusations and 2) If we mention Trudeau said this to Singh himself.

<user_id=DBigXray>
Kindly accept my request to read the page of WP:LEAD first, and then we can talk. Without you reading that page I an sure, this discussion will be futile.''''

<user_id=Elephanthunter>
You actually caught me in the middle of updating my reply to say that, if the Canadian Prime Minister was merely reassuring Singh, that means it is probably not content for WP:LEAD anyway.

<user_id=DBigXray>
Please confirm that you have read the whole page of WP:LEAD and WP:UNDUE today, even if you have read those in past. It is easier to to discuss when we have  aclear understanding of the policy. ''''

<user_id=Adamgerber80>
Please discuss your changes here first. I think you do not understand some Wikipedia policies based on your WP:OR earlier. I am also awaiting your response on another page.

<user_id=Elephanthunter>
Adamgerber80, it's disingenuous to make an edit and then ask that I discuss my changes first. Also, you can't just take a statement out of context and then claim WP:OR.

<user_id=Adamgerber80>
Currently you are changing a lot of content and not just moving it out of the lede. I am referring to your earlier edits that ""the movement was being downplayed by India"". Even now,  where you have changed the mention of Sikh radialization (which does not violate NPOV) and changed the meaning of the sentence. Please discuss your changes here.

<user_id=Elephanthunter>
I am trying to engage in civil conversation with you. Please just speak your mind an explain calmly. I've read and (just now) re-read the sections on WP:LEAD and WP:UNDUE. My point is, to quote Trudeau as if he was not responding to Singh's accusations misrepresents the situation. That's all. But further, that context changes the weight of Trudeau's comments. After re-reading WP:UNDUE I think it becomes less obvious that Trudeau's comments belong in the lede.

<user_id=Elephanthunter>
We did have a discussion about the word ""downplayed"" just above, and I don't believe you responded to me.

<user_id=Adamgerber80>
Because I was still awaiting your answer on the other page which is related to this. Also, please stop creating your own rules about NPOV and respond to the queries that have been raised. Please refrain from editing the page unless we have cleared these issues.

<user_id=Adamgerber80>
Your edits are getting very disruptive currently and it seems your understanding of WP:NPOV is incorrect. Please discuss these edits here. And I did not follow you to this page. I have been editing and watching over this page for a long time (including 24 May, 19 May, 29 April, 22 April, 17 March, 7 March, 25 February to name the latest ones). Please look at the page history before you make baseless accusations on other editors.

<user_id=Elephanthunter>
you came here to make edits after attempting to remove Khalistan from List of active separatist movements in Asia. There you were censoring this group, making the argument they are ""inactive"" (which is false), and then when you claimed the group does not exist within India (even though Indian citizens are being arrested?) It was confusing, to say the least. And now you care about WP:OR, WP:LEAD, etc. but only when anyone makes any update that doesn't paint this group as extremist.

<user_id=Adamgerber80>
I have answered to the inclusion of this on the talk page there. I am currently discussing content based on sources and Wikipedia guidelines. Unfortunately, it seems either you do not understand these rules or do not want to follow them making it a case of WP:IDONTLIKEIT. Please discuss based on sources. Just because some India citizens have been arrested does not make an entire movement active again. This is where your WP:SYNTH comes in. On your point of militant and extremist, these are WP:NPOV words on Wikipedia and have been used across multiple pages and are supported by sources. Please discuss on these basis.

<user_id=Elephanthunter>
Just because the words ""extremist"" or ""militant"" are used on other pages does not mean those words are suddenly NPOV in all situations. You're pushing an Indian nationalist view pretty hard here, but Wikipedia articles should stay professional and neutral. Also, I am familiar with Wikipedia's rules.

<user_id=Adamgerber80>
If you are indeed familiar with the rules of Wikipedia then please explain to me how is militant violating NPOV here? If a WP:RS is supporting it, then it can be included. Wikipedia does not allow using the word terrorist which puts this in the negative light. Any movement which takes arms is referred to as a militant (I hope you get this). Also, please reply to concerns I have raised earlier on how you arrived at this movement to be ""active"" on the relevant page. Lastly, please do not attribute anyone to a view and treat everyone with respect (the same way I have treated you with one and not called you a particular side or the other).

<user_id=DBigXray>
Thanks for re-reading the WP:LEAD and WP:UNDUE again on my WP:Civil request. we will descuss the disputes in order. please respond immediately after the subthreads to prevent confusion.
''Dispute 1: the word ""MILITANT"" and ""EXTREMIST"" vs""GROUPS"" and ""SUPPORTERS""'''

As I can see your reply above. It is clear that you consider the word ""MILITANT"" and ""EXTREMIST"" as non neutral. Please share your source supporting this claim (with link to exact policy and Reliable source).  If you really are familiar with Wiki Policies this should never have arisen in the first place. Armed murderers and shooters cannot be mentioned in the article as mere Supporters. WP:NPOV does not mean Facts will be watered down in a motivated effort to make them appear more palatable.

''Dispute 2: adding CANADA PM Statement in LEAD'''

<user_id=DBigXray>
If you have really read the WP:LEAD as you say, can you explain (with link to exact policy and Reliable source)  why you feel that CANADA PM statement about ''DENYING SUPPORT to revival of KHALISTAN'' does not deserve to be in LEAD ? ''''

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Understanding of Wikipedia Policies**: Both parties are invoking Wikipedia policies such as WP:LEAD, WP:WEIGHT, WP:UNDUE, WP:NPOV, and WP:OR. They are discussing the relevance and application of these policies to the content in question, which indicates a good understanding of the Wikipedia framework for content management.

2. **Relevance of the Canadian PM's Statement**: User DBigXray argues that the Canadian PM's statement is a significant national policy declaration and should be included in the lead section. User Elephanthunter counters that the statement was more of a personal assurance and questions its weight in the lead. Both users are considering the importance of the content and its relevance to the article's summary, which is a valid discussion point.

3. **Use of Terminology (Militant/Extremist vs. Groups/Supporters)**: User DBigXray is concerned with the neutral portrayal of terms and insists on using ""militant"" and ""extremist"" based on WP:NPOV, which allows for the use of such terms if supported by reliable sources. User Elephanthunter suggests that these terms may not be neutral in all contexts. This is a complex issue as it involves the interpretation of neutrality and the representation of groups within Wikipedia's guidelines.

4. **Civility and Respect**: The discussion shows signs of tension, with accusations of disingenuous behavior and pushing a nationalist view. However, there are also calls for civility and respect, indicating an awareness of the need for a professional discourse.

5. **Engagement with Policy and Sources**: Both parties are asking each other to engage with Wikipedia policies and to provide sources for their claims. This is a positive aspect of the discussion as it shows a commitment to grounding the debate in verifiable and policy-compliant information.

6. **Resolution and Progress**: The discussion is somewhat circular, with repeated requests to read policies and a lack of resolution on the issues. This indicates a need for better conflict resolution strategies or third-party mediation.

Overall, the discussion shows a good level of engagement with Wikipedia policies and an attempt to argue based on these guidelines. However, the quality of the discussion is hampered by the circular nature of the arguments and the occasional lapse into less constructive exchanges. The participants are knowledgeable but could benefit from more focused and resolution-oriented dialogue.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

I have found another author in support of the early split of Malayalam and Tamil. '''David Dean Shulman (2016)''' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dean_Shulman) is regarded as one of the world’s foremost authorities on the languages of India, he says;
QUOTE: ""''There has been a tendency among historical linguists to think of Malayalam as having diverged directly from Tamil (the Tamil is spoken from the ancient times in what is today Kerala), perhaps as late as the thirteenth century. But this view is almost certainly wrong. Tamil and Malayalam must have separated from one another at a much earlier stage perhaps around the first millennium AD, as we can see from the several archaic features of Malayalam.”'' UNQUOTE.

As per his own CV, David Shulman does not even say that he knows Malayalam, forget about being an expert in it. You can see it here - https://www.academy.ac.il/Index2/Entry.aspx?nodeId=809&entryId;=18357. There is no reason to think that his comments on Malayalam are on par with the sources that are already given. The origin of both Malayalam and Tamil are traced back to some form of Proto-Dravidian or Proto-Tamil-Malayalam. The authoritative references are already provided. If you wish to add your own comments to this, then please provide similar sources. And Shulman or any others that you provide, unfortunately, do not come anywhere near for this.

You are in denial. I am not going to waste my time in an edit war with you. My questions to you are the following:

<user_id=80.229.155.49>
(1) Do you deny that Kerala produced Sangam classics and the Silappatikaram?
(2) Do you deny that the team behind Malayalam classical language status used Sangam literature as evidence for Malayalam's antiquity?
(3) Do you deny that the Chera dynasty who used Tamil for centuries were based in Kerala?

Sanskrit and Tamil classical literature are something that every Indian should be proud of.

<user_id=80.229.155.49>
There has to be an agreement on semantics before anyone can have a serious discussion on the evolution of Malayalam. 'Tamil' can refer to 3 different stages of the language, 'Old Tamil', 'Middle Tamil' and 'Modern Tamil'.
The difference between a 'language' and 'dialect' must also be defined. In the case of Modern Tamil and Malayalam, it is clear from the ancient literature that the people of Tamilakam (ancient Kerala and Tamil Nadu) regarded themselves as speaking the same language called 'Tamil' which was Old Tamil. This was mutually intelligible despite dialectal differences (East coast vs West coast).
''Govindakutty paper only highlights 3 dialectal differences''' such as varying pronunciations of the initial 'n', the addition of 'u' in East coast Tamil as a second person oblique form, and the preservation of the cluster 'lk' in words such as 'Kolkkai' in the West coast dialect. East coast Tamil has changed the 'lk' into 'rk' e.g. 'Korkai'. '''It is laughable to claim that this is evidence of a different language called Malayalam in the ancient period.''' It is evidence of a different dialect for sure and Govindakutty does not claim otherwise. His designation of 'Proto-Tamil-Malayalam' is only correct if you regard the 'Tamil' in that term as 'Modern Tamil'. But we already have a term for that common language given in the classical literature of that period and it is Tamil, now known in the modern era as 'Old Tamil'.

<user_id=80.229.155.49>

<user_id=Hyper9>
Though your questions are interesting, it is fairly obvious that you do not understand why and how Malayalam is connected to Sangam literature. And I can tell you that it is definitely not the way you think it is. Like you, I am not interested in either an edit war or taking any classes for you. And as for your exhortations on Tamil or Sanskrit ""pride"" or ""classical"" etc etc - they are frankly irrelevant and only serve to stray away from looking at the topic objectively. The Govindankutty article uses just 3 examples for illustrative purposes, there are probably hundreds. It also clearly states that Malayalam cannot be considered as a derivative of any form of Tamil (Old, Middle or Modern) but that it can only be derived from what is designated as 'Proto-Dravidian' or 'Proto-Tamil-Malayalam' - which is also the source of Tamil. What part of that is not clear??

<user_id=Hyper9>
Most of your points on Malayalam are erroneous and cannot be characterised so easily as you try to do. I am frankly not against any well sourced and clearly researched information but most editors here are often just raging and ranting and providing their own opinions which, like mine, are of little value. Such claims are often supported by weak sources by general historians and linguists which is usually outdated as far as Malayalam is concerned and so there is little point in referring to them. If you wish to get answers to questions, you can post them (nicely) on my page but I am not inclined to answer your general and unrelated questions here as many of them are not relevant. Thanks.

<user_id=Hyper9>
Nice poem - With probably a lot of exaggerations. Is this poem your proof for something? If so, please make it clear what you want to say. In any case, I don't see what is your problem with the Wikipedia entry. Both competing theories on Malayalam have been provided space. In fact, I'll point out that the 7th century theory does not have any Malayalam expert's backing, but is often part of the mis-characterisations by Tamil experts who seem to know very little Malayalam. Also, If you wish to discuss Chera dynasty then you can discuss it on the relevant pages. Cheers.

There is no misquoting, as Shanmugam provides a discussion on the issue and then provides a clear conclusion. Only the conclusion is used. Also, the other point he is making is that the relationship between the languages is complex over time, not a simple tree diagram. But that is not the same as saying that the languages are not existing independently. In fact, by selecting parts of his discussion that suit you, you wilfully ignore his final conclusion of the presence of spoken Malayalam around 5th century AD (ie his dating of Sangam literature). If there is any contribution that needs to be made, you can summarise them and add them to the page but there is no need to copy-paste the entire paper here. Also, both views had been listed in a neutral language. Why has this been tampered without any sources or basis? Please feel free to discuss before editing these sections.

<user_id=Nagadeepa>
It is abundantly clear from Shanmugam's article that Proto-Malayalam was not an independent language from Old Tamil, but another spoken dialect which had retained many archaic features not found in the oldest written forms of Tamil. He is clear that Kerala was a Tamil speaking region in the ancient period. He is also clear that the theory that Malayalam is not primarily derived from Old Tamil is untenable. I will request a dispute resolution/3rd party because you are clearly misrepresenting the evidence.

<user_id=Nagadeepa>
you wilfully ignore his final conclusion of the presence of spoken Malayalam around 5th century AD. Shanmugam does not say that anywhere in his article. Stop distorting his words. Please use verbatim quotes from the article in your arguments. Shanmugam clearly states that '''Proto'''-Malayalam was spoken in the Sangam age. That is not the same as modern Malayalam. That is not the same as a completely independent language from Old Tamil. Shanmugam has also covered the great contribution Kerala has made to ancient Tamil literature (which you have deleted because it exposes your fringe view). The ancient literature of Kerala refers to 'Tamil' being spoken in the common region of Tamilakam.

<user_id=Hyper9>
The conclusion presented on the WP page is the one after a dispute resolution. There is no need to modify it without discussing it first. All of these additional sources that you have added have been shown to be deficient. That is already present on this Talk page and it appears that you have not read them. I do not think that the same arguments need to be repeated. Not only this but, Caldwell and Ayyar are so outdated that they can be dismissed outright. You have not been able to produce any more recent or authoritative references but are trying to support your theories with these outdated sources.

<user_id=Hyper9>
I would strongly suggest that if you wish to dispute any content, you ought to discuss the issue in a manner that follows WP:CIVIL. There is no problem for me or any other editor in participating in a discussion if it is carried out in a civil manner. If you would like to do so, please make your points clearly, isolating them clearly from extracts from experts by using quotes or '''bold'''. It is only then that there can be any progress on this, as I am still not sure what your exact point is.

<user_id=Nagadeepa>
You have already been banned previously for your distortions and unscientific edits. Nothing in your responses has any value and is simply hot air. On one hand you use and distort V.S Shanmugam as an accurate reference. Then on the other hand you malign Ayyar as outdated, when the very same Shanmugam quotes and agrees with Ayyar's findings which have stood the test of time. You have evaded all of my questions and just distort accurate sources. Hopefully 3rd party mediation will put an end to your nonsense.

<user_id=Nagadeepa>
I am still not sure what your exact point is.

<user_id=Nagadeepa>
I genuinely think you are playing dumb. It is really obvious what my points are, and I made them explicitly clear in the dispute resolution noticeboard. I suspect you know that you cannot refute any of my points under 3rd party mediation, hence why you have run away from the discussion. I am very happy to continue the conversation without describing what I genuinely think of you, and to leave the debate to the content and nothing else.

Surrounded by the sea on three sides and extending up to Vengadam in the north and Kumari in the south was the ancient Tamil land.

'Historically, Tamil was spoken and written in Kerala alongside Sanskrit and early forms of Malayalam. The two languages. Tamil and Malayalam must have separated by the mid-first millennium, but they remained very close in many ways; Tamil literature flourished in  Kerala from the beginning - whenever that was - and was always a prestigious component of Kerala culture.

<user_id=Nagadeepa>
, (Hyper9) has distorted the work of S.V. Shanmugam (1976). It does '''NOT''' support the fringe view that Malayalam was a separate language from Tamil in the ancient period. In fact, Shanmugam clearly suggests that the idea that Malayalam originated independently from Proto-Dravidian is untenable:
'""'''Kerala''' during the Sangam age '''formed part of a larger linguistic area called Tamilakam, 'the Tamil speaking region''''...Many Tamil poets hailed from this area. Poets like Kapilar, Paranar, Kappiyanar were from the Kerala part of ancient Tamilakam. One of the Sangam works, Pattirupattu was written eulogizing the Chera kings who were the rulers of one part of the Kerala country. Another Sangam work Ainkurunuru, an anthology, was collected and edited in response to an order from one of the Chera kings. The grammatical treatise, Tolkappiyam, which is the earliest extant literary composition in Tamil, is considered to have been have written by a scholar who belonged to the southern-most part of the Kerala coast. '''So, there is no doubt that the language of literature was Centamil, 'standard Tamil', in Kerala at the time'''.""
'""'''a slightly different dialect''', preserving some archaic features not found in any of the literary works of Tamil, must have been vogue in Kerala at the time. Ramaswami Ayyar refers to these features as 'archaisms preserved in the West-coast colloquials'.""''
'""Nevertheless, many changes, which have taken place in the historical period of Tamil, had occurred in Malayalam also. As already noted, only these changes are responsible for Ramaswami Ayyar to say that Malayalam separated from Tamil in the Early Middle Tamil period. Thus, it seems quite certain that the evolution of Malayalam cannot be explained by a tree diagram, i.e. split process alone.""''
'""Yet, some scholars of Malayalam still believe that Malayalam should have originated independently from the Proto-Dravidian at a very early stage. Despite Ramaswami Ayyar's exposition of the '''untenability of this theory''' as early as 1936, a few Malayalam scholars cling to it, their sole support being the presence of some archaisms in the language.""

<user_id=Nagadeepa>
Ramaswami Ayyar - The Evolution of Malayalam Morphology, 1936 Cochin government press - '''a whole book''' by a '''Malayalam linguistic expert''' on the evolution of the language is forthright on the widely held assertion that Malayalam is derived from Middle Tamil:
P138-141  ''As already pointed out above i'''t is with Early Middle Tamil that Malayalam is most intimately related.''' I have been led to stress the question of affiliations so much here because of the view prevailing among some scholars in Malabar (Kerala) that in point of linguistic kinship, Malayalam stands in relation to Tamil on as much a footing of equality as Kannada or even Telugu.''
'""Those who maintain that ""Malayalam is as much independent of Tamil as Kannada or Telugu"" seek support for their view in the following postulates of theirs. It is necessary to examine them here in some detail in view of the vogue obtaining for them among some Malayalam scholars: but '''I may say at once that some of these postulates (see below for discussion) are wholly untenable''', while others are not proved or supported, and further that even if it happens that some of these postulates could be in the future be supported by data which are now not available, one has to remember that '''these features (appearing as archaisms) are after all so few''' that they cannot touch anything more than the outermost fringe of the problem of affinities; for, as I have already pointed out above, correspondences and derivative relationships between Malayalam and a stage of speech answering to Early Middle Tamil are so numerous and fundamental that '''there would be no scientific warrant for any view other than that Malayalam is most intimately allied to stage of speech corresponding to Early Middle Tamil''', with a few archaisms peculiar to the west coast"".''
'On the whole, '''except for a very few archaisms''' like the inflexional n'in-, the plural imperatives with vin, ppin, and perhaps constructions like ceyyam and ceyyarudu, '''the features of Malayalam morphology are directly related to, or immediately derivable from a stage of speech corresponding to what may now be described as Early Middle Tamil'''.""''
Ramaswami Ayyar conclusively puts Govindakutty's ludicrous theory (based on the meagre evidence of 3 dialectal differences) to rest. The book is available here:
https://archive.org/stream/TheEvolutionOfMalayalamMorphology/The-Evolution-of-Malayalam-Morphology
The Silappadikaram - Translation by V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar, lecturer in Indian history and archaeology, University of Madras, Oxford University Press 1939, Page 346:
'""So ends the Silappadikaram...In the manner in which lofty hills are reflected in the mirror, it expresses the essence of '''the cool Tamil country bounded by the Kumari, Vengadam and the eastern and western seas''', in its two quarters of '''pure and impure Tamil''' [3] comprising the five regions (tinais) where dwell men and gods devoted to duty and to the common practice of dharma, artha and kama; and it deals in '''chaste language''' expressive of good sense in flawless rhythm, with aham (love) and puram (war), and with worthy songs...and other things which were in conformity with established rules of the well known forms of vari, kuravai and sedam '''couched in perfect and understandable Tamil.'''""

You incoherent ramblings do not do any good to your argument, if you are making one ie. I am genuinely unable to see what exactly your point is - as you keep saying something different every time. The wording on the Wikipedia page was made neutral to reflect both theories - '''and this was the consensus arrived at by two disputing editors'''. Rather than giving me all these irrelevant points, kindly point out what is it in the page thats so big a problem and what is it about the Shanmugam paper that you think has been interpreted incorrectly. Also, I am giving you ample time and space to discuss this but you are refusing to do so and going and editing the page without any discussion, which is not agreeable.

<user_id=Nagadeepa>
(1) Malayalam is derived from an ancient West Coast dialect of Tamil. The evidence for this is overwhelming in both the linguistic and historical record. It should be made clear in the opening paragraph that this is the widespread view accepted by most scientific scholars. The fringe theory that Malayalam has an older root independent from Tamil is not equatable.
(2) During the ancient period Kerala formed part of a larger linguistic area called Tamilakam, 'The Tamil speaking region'. Much of the extensive ancient Tamil literature was composed in Kerala including Tolkāppiyam, Ainkurunuru, Pathitrupathu and Silappatikaram. There is no doubt that the language of literature in Kerala was Standard Old Tamiḻ (centamiḻ) at the time and this should be mentioned on the page. Internal historical evidence from the said literature clearly shows a Tamil consciousness among the people of Kerala, who saw themselves as speaking Tamil in a Tamil region.
(3) A slightly different spoken colloquial dialect, preserving some archaic features not found in any of the literary works of Tamil must have also been present in Kerala at the time. This accounts for the differences which has led some fringe scholars (e.g. Govindakutty) to claim an independent origin. However, this fringe view has been jettisoned by more serious and scientific scholars such as S.V Shanmugam and Ramaswami Ayyar.
(4) All of the above points I have made are supported by the following reference which has been distorted by you:
S.V. Shanmugam (1976) - Formation and Development of Malayalam, Indian Literature,Vol. 19, No. 3 (May-June 1976)
You have used this above reference to claim an independent origin of Malayalam when in actual fact it supports the mainstream view that Malayalam is largely derived from an ancient form of Tamil.
S.V. Shanmugam - Formation and Development of Malayalam, Indian Literature,Vol. 19, No. 3 (May-June 1976), Page 7, Section 2.1.

<user_id=Nagadeepa>
 Also, I am giving you ample time and space to discuss this but you are refusing to do so.

<user_id=Nagadeepa>
You are the one who ran away from a mediated discussion on spurious grounds. Are you willing to discuss the points in question under 3rd party mediation?

<user_id=Hyper9>
Once again, you do not differentiate between your own views and where you are quoting from an expert. However, I will still try and address the basic source of dispute. Shanmugam (1976) discusses various aspects of the theory for an earlier origin for Malayalam. In contrary to your interpretation of the paper, he is finally agreeing with this 'early' theory. He provides the clearest proof for his conclusion on Page 26 - which you do not appear to have seen. On this page he states clearly that there is an existence of spoken Malayalam when Tamil was used for the purpose of writing the Sangam literature. This is the clearest and simplest form you will see to understand Shanmugam's conclusions.

<user_id=Hyper9>
It is you who has not shown the basic decency when addressing other editors here and not followed WP:CIVIL. I really dont have any problem with having a discussion anywhere as long as you behave appropriately.

<user_id=Nagadeepa>
On this page he states clearly that there is an existence of spoken Malayalam when Tamil was used for the purpose of writing the Sangam literature. He does not say anything of the sort on page 26. Proto-Malayalam is another dialect of Old Tamil and was mutually intelligible with East Coast Old Tamil. This is why 3rd party mediation is needed as you are constantly distorting the paper. As you have agreed to discuss these points anywhere, I will open another dispute resolution. I will leave the discussion to the points and not mention your personal character or behaviour.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. The discussion revolves around the historical and linguistic relationship between Malayalam and Tamil, with specific reference to the works of scholars like David Dean Shulman, S.V. Shanmugam, and Ramaswami Ayyar.

2. User Hyper9 argues for an early separation of Malayalam and Tamil, citing Shulman's work and emphasizing the archaic features of Malayalam. They also refer to Shanmugam's paper to support the early origin theory.

3. User 80.229.155.49 and User Nagadeepa challenge Hyper9's interpretation, arguing that Malayalam is derived from an ancient West Coast dialect of Tamil. They cite historical and literary evidence to support their claim that Kerala was part of the Tamil-speaking region and that the language of literature in Kerala was Standard Old Tamil.

4. User Nagadeepa accuses Hyper9 of distorting Shanmugam's work and insists that the mainstream view supported by scientific scholars is that Malayalam is largely derived from an ancient form of Tamil.

5. The discussion involves references to historical texts, linguistic theories, and interpretations of scholarly work. Both sides present evidence and interpretations to support their views.

6. The quality of the discussion is somewhat compromised by accusations of distortion and evasion, which detract from the objectivity and civility expected in a scholarly debate.

7. Despite the contentious nature of the discussion, both parties provide references and articulate their positions with some degree of coherence. However, the discussion could benefit from a more structured and civil approach to resolving the dispute.

Based on the reasoning above, the discussion shows engagement with scholarly sources and attempts to interpret and apply historical and linguistic evidence. However, the quality is affected by the confrontational tone and accusations of distortion. The discussion could be improved by focusing on the substance of the arguments and maintaining a respectful and civil discourse.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Excessive tagging

<user_id=GreenC>
Everything in the article is well sourced so if you're going to insist on a tag then you will need to support it by listing what is factually inaccurate ie. which facts in the cited sources are not supported by the cited sources. That doesn't mean original research drawing on other sources to disagree with the cited sources, that is a separate issue and now what the factual accuracy tag is for.

<user_id=Tonystewart14>
There was a comment by  that is buried in the ""Very Problematic"" section above but basically says that the article needs more references other than Harden, similar to what  has been saying. I believe Step 1 should be to assemble a list of good references that have not already been used in this article and then go from there in writing and rewriting the article as needed to ensure reliability and NPOV. This is always difficult with subject matter like this, but will be easier once a bibliography is laid out first.
Here are a couple of references (tags removed) that were in the lead section in the past, but I removed these as the facts are already elsewhere and I wanted to avoid references in the lead. I wouldn't use these in the article, but want to mention them in case someone runs by them again.

Harden is Shin's official testimony and naturally takes up a big portion. If that's a problem his testimony can be found in other sources besides Harden. However Jack Upland and HerrGeisterhuhnmann have said that any source that supports Shin's testimony is biased, POV etc.. they are coming at this with a preconception that Shin's story is fundamentally unbelievable ''as a testimony'', and both have said so. This is a logical fallacy. Shin is widely considered to be a reliable witness and his account is broadly believed, there is no controversy or counter narrative with any weight (the DPNK version of events has no consensus). The few legitimate criticisms of Shin are already in the article and sourced. I'm not sure what we hope to accomplish by adding yet more sources in support of Shin's testimony, other than to make the Ref section have fewer ""Hardens"" when doing a visual scan of the page.

<user_id=Jack Upland>
Well, I think having less reliance on Harden would be an improvement. The problem, however, goes deeper. Most of these sources are effectively primary sources, by and large. Harden, as he himself acknowledges, is just repeating what Shin told him without verification, as are the journalists who base articles on interviews with Shin etc. It would be good to have a secondary source, which gives some assessment of Shin's testimony taken with other evidence, etc. This is what Felix Abt does, though not as well as it could be done. A good source would not need to counter Shin, but it would need to take up an independent, analytical stance. This is not merely my point of view: it is Wikipedia policy. Biographical articles should not be based on a first-person account.

<user_id=GreenC>
Harden did more than just repeat Shin's version of events, he vetted the story, as he states: ""the story '''has been vetted''' and rang true to survivors of other labor camps, to scholars, to human rights advocates, and to the South Korean government."" (emphasis added). Harden is a journalist writing a biography in which he vetted the testimony (by way of other experts), it contains original analysis and a lengthy Notes section with dozens of sources besides Shin.

<user_id=Jack Upland>
That's so dishonest. Because Harden says the vetting did not turn up Shin's repeated lying. And Harden also says that Shin's story is unverifiable. Quotation given above.

<user_id=Jack Upland>
And Blaine Harden has now said that Shin has admitted he lied again, and revised the story for a second time. See reference in the article.

<user_id=Tonystewart14>
I think the changes Jack Upland made to the article just now regarding the inaccuracies in the original story look good. I also think that it could be expanded upon, so I'll work on that over the next few days and you all can let me know how it looks. I think if we cover this part and the video from his father contesting the story, we could remove the factual accuracy tag and cover all sides.

<user_id=Jack Upland>
I don't understand why the tag is such a big deal.

<user_id=Tonystewart14>
It's not just the tag itself, but the fact that the article's factual accuracy/NPOV is debated. That is the title of this section, after all.

<user_id=GreenC>
I completely disagree that the changes Jack made look good. It is out of balance with what the rest of the world says about Shin Dong-hyuk. There is no ""skepticism"" about Shin Dong-hyuk except with two people: Jack Upland, and Felix Abt who is arguably not a reliable source. The United Nations, governments, experts, etc.. all say Shin is credible. Tony, ''show me a single source that is skeptical of Shin''' (beside Abt's 1-sentence comment). There is no justification for a section like this. It runs afoul of WP:WEIGHT, it's Jack Upland's personal biases twisting the sources to blow out of proportion something the rest of the world has not done. We don't create original research, synthesizing the source to build a case as to why people should be skeptical.

<user_id=Jack Upland>
Having thought about it, I think that the article needs a permanent tag of some kind until there's some definitive source to settle things one way or the other. The predominant source for the article is Shin himself, primarily as told to Harden. We now know that Shin has altered his story yet again, and that Harden's book is being revised. According to the report, Harden seems to have a bottomless faith in Shin, and believes in whatever the latest version is. I find Shin's inaccuracy very troubling, and Harden's blind acceptance of it even more so. This seems to go against the very basis of what a reliable source is. At the very least, surely we need to warn readers that Shin and Harden have retracted the existing story. It appears that no one is now asserting the factual accuracy of the article as it stands.

<user_id=GreenC>
We're not supposed to write self-referentially eg. ""This article.."" rather state the facts and tag the problem. I've added an Update tag. I think we should keep the biography as written because we don't know the extent or seriousness of the changes. Based on the Post article it looks like he left things out, but didn't make stuff up. And everyone interviewed continues to support Shin's basic account. If he is a reliable source or not will be determined by the sources. If the UN, experts, etc.. continue to support him. It is more than just Harden and Shin that supports his account, for Wikipedia purposes he is still reliable because many support him. If there are detractors then we can weigh, but right now there is only 1, Felix, and he doesn't have much weight.

<user_id=Jack Upland>
I think NPOV is a different, but overlapping, issue from accuracy. I'm very concerned about editors like you, Green Cardamom, who claim to know what sources say when you haven't read them (and apparently you've never read Harden's book), and who dismiss them even when they are proven correct. Wikipedia is not a propaganda website for the DPRK, but equally it is not a propaganda website against them. Any neutral person would now acknowledge that Shin is now a very dubious source about anything.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. <user_id=GreenC> argues against the excessive tagging and insists that any factual inaccuracies should be explicitly stated. They emphasize that the article is well-sourced and that the sources cited are supportive of Shin's testimony. They also argue that adding more sources would not necessarily improve the article but would just visually dilute the number of times Harden is cited.

2. <user_id=Tonystewart14> suggests that the article could benefit from additional references to ensure reliability and a neutral point of view (NPOV). They also acknowledge the difficulty of dealing with controversial subject matter and propose a step-by-step approach to improve the article.

3. <user_id=Jack Upland> raises concerns about the reliance on primary sources and suggests that secondary sources that provide an independent analysis would improve the article. They also point out that Wikipedia policy discourages biographical articles based solely on first-person accounts.

4. <user_id=GreenC> defends Harden's work, stating that it has been vetted by various experts and is not just a repetition of Shin's story. They argue that Harden's work contains original analysis and is supported by a range of sources.

6. <user_id=Tonystewart14> and <user_id=Jack Upland> discuss the factual accuracy tag and the importance of addressing all sides of the story to ensure NPOV.

7. <user_id=GreenC> argues that the skepticism towards Shin Dong-hyuk is not widespread and that the article should reflect the consensus view of Shin as a credible witness. They also caution against creating original research by synthesizing sources to cast doubt on Shin's credibility.

8. <user_id=Jack Upland> suggests that a permanent tag may be necessary until a definitive source can settle the matter, expressing concern over the reliability of Shin and Harden as sources.

9. <user_id=GreenC> proposes an update tag and argues for maintaining the biography as written until more information is available. They emphasize that the broader support for Shin's account should be considered when assessing his reliability.

10. <user_id=Jack Upland> emphasizes the importance of NPOV and expresses concern about editors dismissing sources without having read them. They argue for a neutral approach to the subject matter.

Overall, the discussion shows a clear divide between the participants on the reliability of sources and the approach to NPOV. There is a mix of well-reasoned arguments and some instances of ad hominem attacks. The participants are engaged in a substantive debate about the content and sourcing of the article, which is a positive aspect of the discussion. However, the accusations of dishonesty and the dismissal of concerns without fully addressing them detract from the quality of the discussion.

Promotion of eugenics for low income and low IQ parents

<user_id=Fæ>
Young's article in September 2015 on ""Progressive Eugenics"" includes his proposal to provide free embryo screening to poor people and those with low intelligence: ""why not offer it free of charge to parents on low incomes with below-average IQs?"". Sources:

<user_id=Philip Cross>
The issue is clearly relevant for the article, but not yet suitable for the summary which is not intended to include material absent from the main article. Nor do sources suggest Young's recent resignation from the OfS board is linked with the clandestinely held eugenics conference at UCL, as was suggested in the additions I removed. While Young was present, sources so far are not suggesting he played an active role. Adding it to the summary was presumptive. As I say, it should be in the main article first before it is covered in the summary.

<user_id=Fæ>
Glad we agree it's relevant. In the context of someone with some control over how schools are managed, Young's views on how we should use eugenics to possibly give the bottom 10% of society more intelligent children is enlightening. Equating being ""in the bottom 10%"" with having a genetic low IQ, is pretty informative of how Young thinks about children.

<user_id=El Badboy!>
@ Mr Cross. You removed the additions? Could I ask why specifically and what was the problem?

<user_id=Philip Cross>
I state the issue above. Another source. Incidentally, he ''was'' actively involved in the related conference in Toronto, which it would be best to concentrate on here, a few months after the University College London event, as well as the coverage of Young's ''Quadrant'' article. The UCL article does not yet have a passage on the the secret conference controversy.

<user_id=J.M.Ike>
Since the information has been added to the lede again, I thought I'd mention that I think there should be a section on this within the article. It does seem odd to include this content in the lede and not the main text. This controversy is definitely notable enough for it to merit mention within the article text and ought not to be removed.

<user_id=WoodChopper>

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Fæ introduces the topic by mentioning Toby Young's article on ""Progressive Eugenics"" and his proposal to provide free embryo screening to poor people and those with low intelligence. The user provides several sources to support the claim, including an archived article, references to Young's views on eugenics, and a tweet by Young that was deleted.

2. User Philip Cross responds by acknowledging the relevance of the issue but argues that it is not yet suitable for the summary section of the article. The user points out that the material is absent from the main article and that there is no direct link between Young's resignation and the eugenics conference at UCL, as suggested by the additions.

3. User Fæ counters by emphasizing the importance of Young's views on eugenics, especially in the context of his influence over school management. The user argues that Young's equating of being ""in the bottom 10%"" with having a genetic low IQ is indicative of his perspective on children and intelligence.

4. User El Badboy! asks Philip Cross for clarification on why the additions were removed, seeking a more detailed explanation.

5. User Philip Cross reiterates the issue and suggests focusing on Young's active involvement in a related conference in Toronto and the coverage of Young's article in ""Quadrant."" The user also notes that the UCL article does not yet cover the secret conference controversy.

6. User J.M.Ike agrees that the controversy is notable and should be mentioned within the article text, finding it odd to include the content in the lead without it being present in the main body of the article.

7. User WoodChopper provides additional sources about the eugenics conference and mentions the attendance of Emil O. W. Kirkegaard, who has neo-Nazi views. The user also notes recent news articles that mention both Toby Young and Emil Kirkegaard.

8. User WoodChopper informs that UCL has issued an official statement and that the eugenics conferences have been suspended.

Evaluation of Discussion Quality:

The discussion shows a clear engagement with the topic, with users providing sources and arguing about the relevance and placement of the information within the Wikipedia article. User Fæ provides a strong argument for the inclusion of the information based on its relevance to Young's influence on education. User Philip Cross raises valid concerns about the summary's content and the need for the information to be included in the main article first. User J.M.Ike's point about the oddity of including the information in the lead but not the main body of the article is well-taken and suggests a need for structural consistency within the article. User WoodChopper contributes by providing additional sources and updating the discussion with UCL's response to the controversy.

Overall, the discussion is fact-based, with users providing sources and engaging in a back-and-forth that is focused on the content and structure of the Wikipedia article. The arguments are coherent, relevant, and show an understanding of Wikipedia's guidelines for content inclusion and summarization.

Suppression of reference

<user_id=Iñaki LL>
I am the main contributor to this article and, coming down to detail, there is nothing that leads us to think that the invasion of Hispania was a premeditated plan. Information available suggests that developments on the ground escalated from an initial military support by Tariq to the officialist faction led by Achila II on into a full-blown political takeover of the Visigothic Kingdom. This is suggested by Roger Collins. ''Collins, Roger (1989). The Arab Conquest of Spain 710-797''.

<user_id=Swazzo>
your edit summery 'Rv fully sourced info...' is strange since I only added further referenced content and did not remove the sourced info added by Marcel. Is there a specific reason for your removal of the sourced content I added? Regards -

<user_id=Iñaki LL>
Um...I took a look at this, where no mention is done to the Caliph. Also the source that would support your claim does not say anything about any Caliphs. Plus from what I can remember, Collins does not support a Caliph sending orders to invade Hispania. Regards

<user_id=Swazzo>
I also took a look at the source added by Marcel and it does not say anything about any Caliphs. It instead refers to his ''wali''. Don't get me wrong, Collins is well-respected historian, but I think it's fair to include differing information from other reliable sources.

<user_id=Iñaki LL>
The thing is none of the sources cite a Caliph, so why add it? A wali is cited, but I think it refers to the next commander breaking into the Peninsula, al-Nusayr.

<user_id=Kansas Bear>
'There was a time when the Moors Ruled Spain'', is self published(AuthorHouse), and the author has written a similarly titled book about the Romans. Do you have information concerning this author?
Your link goes to this:

and not what you wrote, ''Civilizations Past and Present, Chapter 7. The Islamic World, 800-1300''
Civilizations Past and Present, Single Volume Edition to be a testing book, can not find a publisher and I see no author. Doubtful RS.
For:

The source says nothing of the Caliph, so do not alter the statement, that is WP:SYNTH or (as bad) misrepresentation of sources. Thanks

<user_id=Iñaki LL>
I do not know what the point is of adding the Caliph, it does not look like precise or safe information, it is speculative altogether. Not having further time right now, and would need to confirm it in detail, but Collins, who elaborates on the matter, does not find any evidence to support such claim.

<user_id=Iñaki LL>
This is getting a bit boring, Swazzo. Please do not alter the content of sources, that is WP:SYNTH at best (please read it), if not WP:OR and misrepresentation of sources. You may add that phrase in another place if relevant. Thanks

<user_id=Swazzo>
please tell me, what do you find faulty in the sentence:

<user_id=Swazzo>
The sentence does not mention or imply that the Umayyad conquest was a premeditated plan in any way, shape, or form, it simply states that it took place during the reign of Al Walid I. Also, a source has to actually support its adjacent claim and far more than 'Forces led by Tariq ibn Ziyad' is cited and quoted. I moved the source to a relevant section where the event is discussed in detail. Regards -

<user_id=Iñaki LL>
I am trying to be didactic but you are not hearing, right?

<user_id=Kansas Bear>
Is there some unknown reason why Swazzo is removing the source, ''The Muslim Conquest and Settlement of North Africa and Spain''? And continuing to edit war to remove it?

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Source Verification**: The discussion revolves around the accuracy and interpretation of historical sources. Iñaki LL and Kansas Bear emphasize the importance of accurately representing what the sources say, particularly regarding the involvement of the Caliph in the invasion of Hispania. They point out that the sources do not support the claim that the Caliph ordered the invasion.

2. **Relevance of Sources**: Swazzo attempts to introduce new sources to support their claims. However, Kansas Bear questions the reliability of these sources, noting that one is self-published and the other does not provide clear information about its publisher or authorship.

3. **Understanding of Wikipedia Policies**: Iñaki LL references Wikipedia policies such as WP:SYNTH (prohibition against synthesis of published material to advance a position) and WP:OR (original research), suggesting that Swazzo's edits may be violating these policies by misrepresenting or extrapolating from the sources.

4. **Coherence of Argument**: Marcel Baron introduces a new perspective, citing the French Wikipedia and suggesting that some Arab-Muslim historians mention Tariq deciding on his own to land in Spain. This adds complexity to the argument but is not fully addressed by the other participants.

5. **Civility and Constructiveness**: The discussion, while heated, remains relatively civil. Participants are focused on the content and quality of the sources rather than personal attacks. However, there is some frustration expressed by Iñaki LL, indicating a breakdown in communication.

6. **Resolution and Consensus**: The discussion does not seem to be moving towards a resolution or consensus. Swazzo's persistence in adding potentially unsupported information and the repeated removal of this information by others indicate a stalemate rather than a productive dialogue.

Overall, the discussion shows an engagement with the material and an attempt to uphold Wikipedia's standards for verifiability and reliable sourcing. However, the repeated back-and-forth without resolution, the potential misrepresentation of sources, and the introduction of questionable sources detract from the quality of the argumentation.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Nietzsche never said anything like that. Complete fiction!

<user_id=Epipelagic>
You seem very confident for someone whose edits are generally getting things so wrong. I've reinstated your deletion and added a further source.

<user_id=77.47.74.232>
This is Nietzsche's ""Duty"" Quote in context:
He never said it is the duty to help the weak. Once again: pure fiction. Nietzsche has written a lot about pity and the like, he has always spoken very clearly. I ask you not to put words into Nietzsche's mouth. Even your ""sources"" should not do that, it proves their poor quality.

<user_id=77.47.74.232>
Unfortunately, Nietzsche's words are still not reflect here. Nietzsche never spoke about ""the weak"", he spoke about mediocre people. In the same paragraph, Nietzsche explained why equal rights are unfair and and perverted. Your formulation creates a false impression of Nietzsche's thought. Mediocrity enables outstanding people, so these special people have an interest to preserve the mediocre. This has nothing to do with altruism. Mr. Kaufmann may be the most popular person in the world, but that does not give him the right to propagate false information.

<user_id=Epipelagic>
Of course Nietzsche never spoke about ""the weak"". Nor did he use the word ""mediocre"". He was writing in German. Kaufmann's judgement on what would be the best word in English takes precedence over your personal opinion. Bear in mind Kaufmann was writing from a place where he was deeply immersed in the entirety of Nietzsche's publications. If you are going to continue editing on Wikipedia, you need to familiarise yourself with its key policies, such as the need to verify your contributions with reliable sources, and the need to avoid original research, which is what you are engaged in right now. You may feel your personal opinions are all that matters here, but that's not the case.

<user_id=77.47.74.232>
What kind of logic is that? I'm talking about a specific quote. This discussion is starting to get very strange. Nietzsche may have spoken trillions of times of ""the weak"", but in that specific quote he spoke of the mediocre. The quote can be found in Nietzsche's ""The Antichrist"".
Of course Nietzsche never spoke about the weak"". Nor did he use the word ""mediocre"".
He used the word mediocre, ""mittelmäßig"" to be exact. This is a fact, even Kaufmann does not have the right to distort the reality. I do not do any original research, I only speak of verifiable facts.
to treat those weaker than oneself
This part is wrong, it changes the whole meaning of Nietzsche's work. This is not a question of interpretation, words are placed in Nietzsche's mouth that he never used.

<user_id=77.47.74.232>
To show you the ridiculousness of your thinking, here is a another quote from ""The Antichrist"":
What is happiness?  The feeling that power increases that resistance is overcome.  Not contentment, but more power; not peace at any price, but war; not virtue, but efficiency (virtue in the Renaissance sense, virtu , virtue free of moral acid).  The weak and the botched shall perish: first principle of our charity.  And one should help them to it.  What is more harmful than any vice?  Practical sympathy for the botched and the weak Christianity.
Here was spoken of ""the weak"", Nietzsche said they should perish. A great contrast to Kaufmann's ""interpretation"", is it not? To claim that Nietzsche has ever considered it a duty to help the weak is not factual.

<user_id=77.47.74.232>
The Antichrist was written in 1888, but Nietzsche did not have his mental breakdown until 1889. I understand you now, you are an ideologue who wants to push a liberal interpretation/distortion. There are also Nietzsche interpretations besides Kaufmann, this is self-evident. He is not the last word in the matter, contrary to your thinking. One should ask why you want to dilute Nietzsche's words with an intermediate man, Nietzche's own words are the primary source:

<user_id=77.47.74.232>
Sometimes, a primary source is even the best possible source, such as when you are supporting a direct quotation. In such cases, the original document is the best source because the original document will be free of any errors or misquotations introduced by subsequent sources.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User <user_id=77.47.74.232> begins by asserting that a quote attributed to Nietzsche is incorrect, stating that Nietzsche never said anything about a duty to help the weak. This user is focused on maintaining the accuracy of Nietzsche's words and is concerned about misrepresentation.

2. User <user_id=Epipelagic> defends the edit by citing additional sources and emphasizing the importance of reliable sources and avoiding original research on Wikipedia. This user is advocating for the use of scholarly interpretation and translation, specifically referencing Kaufmann's work.

3. User <user_id=77.47.74.232> continues to argue that the specific quote in question from ""The Antichrist"" does not mention ""the weak"" but rather ""mediocre"" people, and that the translation or interpretation by Kaufmann is incorrect. This user is emphasizing the importance of fidelity to the original text and the original language (German).

4. User <user_id=77.47.74.232> provides further evidence from Nietzsche's work to support their argument, quoting from ""The Antichrist"" to show Nietzsche's actual stance on the weak. This user is attempting to demonstrate a contrast between the original text and the interpretation being challenged.

5. User <user_id=77.47.74.232> accuses <user_id=Epipelagic> of ideological bias and insists on the primacy of Nietzsche's own words over interpretations. This user is advocating for direct quotations from primary sources as the most accurate representation of an author's intent.

Evaluation of Discussion Quality:

- The discussion shows a clear engagement with the subject matter and a strong emphasis on accuracy and fidelity to the original text.
- Both parties present arguments, with one side advocating for the use of scholarly interpretation and the other for strict adherence to the original language and context.
- The user challenging the edit provides direct quotes and references to the original work, which strengthens their argument.
- The user defending the edit emphasizes Wikipedia's policies on verifiability and reliable sources but does not directly address the specific language concerns raised by the challenger.
- The discussion could benefit from a more collaborative approach to resolving the dispute, such as seeking a third opinion or additional scholarly sources to clarify the translation issue.

Overall, the discussion is substantive and shows a high level of engagement with the material, but it lacks resolution and collaborative problem-solving. The arguments are focused and relevant, but the discussion is somewhat adversarial.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.0",7.0

Neutrality

<user_id=WikiDan61>
This article appears to be written entirely from the point of view of the protesters, and appears to be an attempt to use Wikipedia as yet another platform on which to transmit their protest.

<user_id=Raskolnikov.Rev>
WikiDan61, this is now the second time that you have made that objection without any evidence to back it up with. The first time you tried to have it deleted against the guidelines, which state that new articles should be approached carefully and not dismissed out of hand. The issues you had raised then have now been corrected as far I see. If you disagree, then provide evidence showing that it is indeed biased and 'another attempt to transmit the protest', or I will remove the neutrality notice per the guidelines: 'Everyone can agree that marking an article as having an NPOV dispute is a temporary measure, and should be followed up by actual contributions to the article in order to put it in such a state that people agree that it is neutral.'
So go on, provide that contribution or show why it 'appears' to you to be biased.

<user_id=WikiDan61>
The bias is apparent in the fact that the entire article serves to promulgate the protesters' point of view with no attempt made to present the University's position. It further goes out of its way to color the language in favor of the students (with their ""more conciliatory efforts"" to fight the ""very drastic cuts""). It is sourced extensively to articles from ''Folia'', the university's own student-run magazine (whose neutrality in the matter must be questioned), or to the website of the Humanities Rally group that is at the heart of this protest. The events have received national attention, and the citations reflect that, but the lack of balance in presenting the university's position is disturbing.

<user_id=Raskolnikov.Rev>
I can only go by the actual examples of supposed bias you provide, and you mention three concrete points. 1. 'more conciliatory efforts', how would you prefer to have that worded? The efforts in question are those which are less drastic than occupation, like organizing demonstrations and petitions. I have edited it to reflect that, which is a factual claim (demonstrations and petitions are more conciliatory forms of protest than an occupation). 2. The sentence 'very drastic cuts', you're right, I edited that to make sure it reflects the opinions of the people in question by adding 'what they perceived to be'. 3. References to Folia, which is a student-run magazine by the University itself. You probably don't know Dutch, so your ignorance regarding this is understandable, but Folia is far from a biased source. The main column that is currently on its front-page is written against the occupation, and the 'live blogs' are all written from a neutral point of view. In fact, it is arguably biased against the occupiers. This is not strange because it is a University-run magazine. But you have failed to give concrete examples of a reference to Folia which you find problematic, and this also goes for Humanities Rally. The references to Humanities Rally is a purely factual one, namely when their demands or petitions are mentioned that are available on their website. So please provide the examples of which reference(s) for which claims you find problematic, and I will fix that. Unless you do that, your claim is without foundation. Finally, you say the point of view of the University is not presented. Again, provide a concrete example of this so that it can be fixed.

<user_id=Raskolnikov.Rev>
I find it disturbing that you have been breaking Wiki guidelines since this article was started, first by proposing to have it deleted based on the factually inaccurate claim that it was a mere 'local' protest with no national significance (demonstrably false), and then by adding a disputed notification without following the guidelines of resolving it, which are: 'Everyone can agree that marking an article as having an NPOV dispute is a temporary measure, and should be followed up by actual contributions to the article in order to put it in such a state that people agree that it is neutral.'

<user_id=Raskolnikov.Rev>
You seem to be the one who is biased here, unless, again, you provide concrete examples of bias which I (and others) can fix, so that the dispute notification can be taken down with consensus.

<user_id=WikiDan61>
I have given the reasons for my belief that the article is not neutral. The largest issue is that it presents only the protesters' side of the conflict without giving any voice to the University. Surely there are reasons why the austerity measures have been introduced, but no voice is given to that side of the issue. As to the issue of ""more conciliatory efforts"", I would request that the actual steps that the students took prior to the occupation. A background section, listing the events leading up to the occupation, including the University's actions, the protesters' initial reactions (demonstrations, petitions, etc), the University's response to those initial actions, etc. A chronology of events, showing the actions of both sides of the conflict, would provide a neutral picture of the state of affairs.

<user_id=WikiDan61>
And please remember to assume good faith when dealing with other editors. I have followed Wikipedia policy as I interpret it in dealing with this article. You have asked that I make contributions to resolve the neutrality issue. I cannot fix the actual article because I don't read Dutch and so cannot properly interpret the available source material. Therefore, I have taken the action that I could: I marked the article as having a neutrality issue, and then I explained the perceived neutrality issue on this talk page. This discussion is the natural outcome of that neutrality tag, and when resolved, I hope we can remove the tag. The resolution is not an instantaneous event; it takes time. The tag is temporary, but I don't believe we're ready to remove it yet. You are free to seek a third opinion or follow other dispute resolution mechanisms if you prefer.

<user_id=143.176.92.106>
I have to agree on the lack of neutrality. I do speak dutch and can say it is showing only one point of view. http://www.uva.nl/nieuws-agenda/nieuws/uva-nieuws/item/college-van-bestuur-betreurt-uitkomst-gesprek-met-bezetters-bungehuis.html This article is a reaction from the university officials that talks with the occupiers have failed and how they feel bout that. The official website, the public documents of the trial and the statements of the city are totally missing in the sources AND the actual content. On top of this, I have to question the entire relevance of this article. This is an conflict within a university that is ""ongoing"". Without stating my opinion bout this conflict, it remains to be seen if the occupation will have any relevance. For example. The ""maagdenhuisbezetting"" occupation doesn't have an article like this but is part of the article belonging to the building on the dutch wiki.
The article doesn't have any encyclopidic relevance as it is now. It is bout a conflict between (some) students of the UVA and the board of the same iniversity. This has no historic value at all unless this would be the start of a much bigger movement. In that case the article bout that movement would be the place to note this occupation. So I would step this up one bit further and disagree with the existence of this page.

<user_id=Raskolnikov.Rev>
I have made edits to add more explicitly the point of view of the University, please review it again to see if that is sufficient, and if not, what more could be added and where to ensure that it is. As for the user above who speaks Dutch, you replied before the edit I assume, because the University's response is now referenced (and already was in the many other references; again, FoliaWeb, NOS, AT5, etc. are not biased sources). If you believe that is not sufficient, make the necessary edits. Your personal opinion about the relevance of the occupation is irrelevant. It has been shown that it is more than a mere 'local' affair. And of course by denying that this is so, ignoring all the facts that show otherwise (national news attention given to it, parliamentarians asking parliamentary questions about it, etc.), you have already shown your opinions about it, and again, those aren't relevant.

<user_id=WikiDan61>
The IP editor has pointed out the fact that Wikipedia is not a newspaper. Events such as this occupation are only encyclopedic if thay have long-lasting effects, such as a change in the governance of the school or some other such outcome. If the outcome of the occupation is that 46 students got arrested and nothing at the school changed, the event was probably not significant, despite the fact that it received a blip of national attention.

<user_id=Raskolnikov.Rev>
The page you link to says the following: 'Wikipedia does not report on everything going on in the world today. There is usually no need to write articles about things with no historical significance whatsoever.' It does not define 'historical significance' in the way you do, which is that is needs to 'have long-lasting effects, such as a change in the governance of the school or some other such outcome.' Where did you get this criteria from? Please provide a link to it. That seems like an absurd standard to me, meaning that important events that do not have immediate 'long-lasting outcomes', which are hard to define anyway, should be excluded from Wikipedia. Naturally this is not practice, for I can point out countless pages on Wiki that do need meet that standard. For just one example, here's the page for Occupy San Francisco: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_San_Francisco Will you propose to have that as well as countless other pages deleted because Wiki is not a newspaper and it does not meet your criteria of the event having any 'long-lasting' effect? However, even if you do take that standard, the Occupation ended today, so there is no way to know as of yet whether it will have a 'long-lasting outcome' or not. If you read my latest edit, you would have seen that the board of directors has said that they want to maintain dialogue with the protesters, and that that the planned cuts are preliminary and open to change.

<user_id=Raskolnikov.Rev>
Anyway, are you now content with the neutrality of the piece with the edits made reflecting the POV of the University, or do you believe more of that should be added? If so, where exactly? I have so far addressed all the concerns you have mentioned I believe, so it is not unreasonable for me to ask to clarify where you still see bias and if you do not to remove the 'disputed' tag. By the way, the reason I have not asked a third party about this as of yet is because I do assume good faith of editors, and have done so continuously, hence my repeated requests to you for where you want to see edits, and my compliance when you have pointed it out.  I would like you to extend the same courtesy to me. Note that from the beginning you have been implicitly accusing me, the creator of the page, of bias and of trying to merely find another platform for the protest without actually knowing what my position on the protest is. Assuming good faith goes both ways.

<user_id=WikiDan61>
The specific guidelines for the inclusion of events can be found at WP:EVENT. The issues of historical significance are covered there.

<user_id=WikiDan61>
I don't feel that the neutrality issue has yet been resolved. However, I think there is enough information in the page as it now stands to build a neutral version. I'll see what I can do when I have some more free time (hopefully this evening). I'll create a proposed alternate version of the article to be reviewed by concerned parties prior to updating the live version.

<user_id=Raskolnikov.Rev>
Thanks for the link, it confirms what I already said, namely that 'having a lasting effect' is merely one factor to determine whether an event is notable, and: 'It may take weeks or months to determine whether or not an event has a lasting effect. This does not, however, mean recent events with unproven lasting effect are automatically non-notable.'

<user_id=Raskolnikov.Rev>
And I await your proposed revision, I trust it will be done in good faith and won't be biased, and that the dispute notification can then be removed with consensus.

<user_id=WikiDan61>
I have created a proposed version at . I think I have captured the major facts in what I hope is a more neutral version. Please review.

<user_id=Raskolnikov.Rev>
Thanks for that, I think that page is fine, though a few edits were necessary I believe. I will list them below, but I also was wondering if you could add a 'box' on the side of the page with the date, location, causes and methods as for example on this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_San_Francisco (they overlap in many respects so you can just take over those elements).
And is it possible to add a picture to the box as well? This picture of the occupied building is in the public domain: https://scontent-ams.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10431718_403660026460031_8965783529751310797_n.jpg?oh=ecd4eb0f4a826b0d791d0b7f9f2dd294&oe;=554B9171
Here is the few changes I made and my reasoning for it, which I hope you will agree with:
1. When naming 'The New University' and 'Humanities Rally' for the first time, I added a link to their respective websites/pages as reference.
2. I clarified the conflation between Humanities Rally, the protest movement mentioned above that arose in September 2014, and The New University, which is distinct from them and was the group responsible for the occupation in February. Their demands only arose in February and were part of the occupation, so I think it makes more sense to put that part of the text in the 'Occupation' section.
3. I added a link to the actual text of 'Profiel 2016' as it came out in November 2014.
4. I fixed the inaccurate conflation between Profiel 2016 as it came out in November 2014, which did not contain the following plans: 'Masters degree courses with fewer than 20 students would be eliminated, and only three PhD students would be supported at any given time'. That was in the so-called 'houtskoolschets' leaked in early February, so I clarified that. Secondly, I realize that you still for some reason think FoliaWeb is not a neutral source for that claim, so instead I added a citation from the actual document itself: http://www.studentenraad.nl/wp-content/uploads/Ontwerp-Profiel-2016.pdf

<user_id=WikiDan61>
I have moved your comments and made my reply at  so that we can discuss my draft at its proper talk page.

<user_id=145.18.217.51>
A resolved neutrality discussion? It still looks extremely one-sided to me. There is not a single word devoted to the problems that staff members experienced, for example the disruption of their research activities. This did indeed take place, even though it was always denied by the occupiers. One example is discussed in this source: http://nieuws.thepostonline.nl/2015/02/19/ik-kan-elk-moment-huilen-uitbarsten-die-bezetters-hebben-geen-idee-welke-schade-ze-aanrichten/
Nor is there any mention of the petition by staff members agains the occupation. Right now, it looks like everyone except the university board supported the occupation, which is not true.

<user_id=Raskolnikov.Rev>
Perhaps it's a good idea when you question the neutrality of this article not to post from a University of Amsterdam IP, it doesn't reflect well on your motivations. Keep in mind that Wiki editors have to contribute from a NPOV. Incidentally, the baby-lab case was in the article before the neutrality dispute was resolved. You are free to add that as well as the petition you refer to (which I have not heard of and I hope you will have a credible source for) if you like, though naturally now that it has been pointed out that the person who is going to do so was posting from a UvA IP I would be extra careful as to how you word it.

<user_id=145.18.217.51>
Well, that's the reason why I didn't make the edits myself, I'm not neutral. I can post from another IP and pretend to be neutral of course, but I figured this was more fair. The petition was reported in the media, for example: http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Nederland/article/detail/3853507/2015/02/17/UvA-promovendi-willen-einde-bezetting-Bungehuis.dhtml

<user_id=145.18.217.51>
One of these neutral Wikipedia people can work it in, I'm sure, just like all the other very neutral edits to this article not made by anyone involved in the protests.

<user_id=Raskolnikov.Rev>
Thanks for the honesty. I've added the points you've mentioned to the article as a 'neutral Wikipedia person' who, as said, had included some of them before as well before other neutral Wikipedia people had edited them out (see the change log). Now, kindly let us know if it is now satisfactory for you so that the neutrality dispute can be marked as resolved, or otherwise where exactly you believe additional changes, and of exactly what kind, should be made so that it can be marked as such.

<user_id=145.18.217.51>
It's better now, thanks! But I'll note again that there is a new petition by staff to counter the one-sided view that all staff is all for the ongoing protests, and the existing petition against the CvB. Reported here: http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/4/AMSTERDAM/article/detail/3955786/2015/04/15/UvA-hoogleraren-steunen-bestuur-in-petitie-Het-geluid-was-nogal-eenzijdig.dhtml

<user_id=Raskolnikov.Rev>
I'm waiting to see how things will play out before updating the page with relevant recent events so as to not include the stuff that seems noteworthy as it is happening but turns out not to be in hindsight. None of the recent petitions have been mentioned, supportive or critical of the CvB, but when they are I'll make sure to include both.

",0,"The discussion begins with WikiDan61 raising concerns about the neutrality of an article, suggesting it is biased towards the protesters' point of view and lacks representation of the University's position. Raskolnikov.Rev challenges WikiDan61 to provide concrete evidence of bias and to contribute to the article to resolve the neutrality dispute.

WikiDan61 provides specific examples of biased language and sources, and points out the lack of the University's perspective. Raskolnikov.Rev responds by addressing these points, making edits to the article, and asking for further clarification on any remaining issues.

The dialogue continues with both users engaging in a back-and-forth about the neutrality of the article, the relevance of the event being discussed, and Wikipedia's guidelines on notability and event coverage. WikiDan61 references WP:EVENT to support his argument about historical significance, while Raskolnikov.Rev argues that the event's lasting impact cannot be determined immediately and that the article has been edited to reflect a more neutral point of view.

WikiDan61 then takes a proactive step by creating a proposed neutral version of the article for review. Raskolnikov.Rev reviews the proposed version, makes some edits, and suggests adding an information box similar to other event articles.

An anonymous user (145.18.217.51), later revealed to be posting from a University of Amsterdam IP, joins the discussion, pointing out additional aspects of the event that were not covered in the article, such as the disruption to staff members and a petition against the occupation. Raskolnikov.Rev acknowledges the validity of these points and agrees to include them in the article.

Throughout the discussion, both WikiDan61 and Raskolnikov.Rev demonstrate a commitment to Wikipedia's guidelines and to improving the article's neutrality. They both provide reasoned arguments, cite guidelines, and engage in constructive dialogue. Raskolnikov.Rev shows a willingness to make changes based on feedback, and WikiDan61 takes the initiative to draft a revised version of the article.

The anonymous user's contributions, while initially lacking neutrality due to their affiliation with the University, ultimately help to improve the article by highlighting missing perspectives. Raskolnikov.Rev's response to this user is also constructive, as they incorporate the feedback while maintaining a neutral stance.

Overall, the discussion is characterized by a high level of engagement, reasoned argumentation, and adherence to Wikipedia's standards. Both main participants show a willingness to collaborate and revise their positions based on evidence and guidelines. The involvement of the anonymous user adds depth to the discussion by bringing in additional perspectives, which are then constructively addressed.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 9.0",9.0
"<user_id=Ilovetopaint>
You know very well that the track was named in honor of Sean's band, and that mentioning it genuinely informs the context of the album. What is with these pedantic reverts?

<user_id=153.205.69.164>
Could you provide the source that states ""'Micro Disneycal World Tour' was named in honor of Microdisney""?

<user_id=Ilovetopaint>
This has already been satisfied by two references which observe the fact that a guy who was in a band called ""Microdisney"" remixed the album track called ""Micro Disneycal World Tour"". Even if the song wasn't actually named after the band (yeah right), the fact that a member of ''that'' band happened to remix ''that'' track would still be of encyclopedic interest.

<user_id=153.205.69.164>
To quote WP:SYNTH, in the Wikipedia, we are not allowed to ""combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources"".

<user_id=Ilovetopaint>
Are you seriously suggesting that it's WP:SYNTH to establish encyclopedic context by noting the well-known bands that an individual musician hails from?

<user_id=153.205.69.164>
I'm serious. When we add a sentence like ""'Micro Disneycal World Tour' was named in honor of Microdisney"", the sentence has to be directly supported by the source.

<user_id=Ilovetopaint>
That wasn't what you removed.

<user_id=153.205.69.164>
The sources do not state that Sean O'Hagan is a co-founder of the High Llamas and Microdisney, which is why I quote WP:SYNTH.

<user_id=153.205.69.164>
Your edit does not satisfy WP:NOR concerns.

<user_id=153.205.69.164>
Besides, I have no idea what makes you want to mention only Sean O'Hagan in the article. As credited as ""The Micro Disneycal World Tour (High Llamas Remix)"" on iTunes and Spotify, for ''FM'', ""The Micro Disneycal World Tour"" was remixed by the High Llamas, not only Sean O'Hagan. Even the MTV source you added states that it is ""the High Llamas' take on 'The Micro Disneycal World Tour'"". He is not the remixer for ""Micro Disneycal World Tour"". Although Sean O'Hagan is a member of the High Llamas, the High Llamas is not Sean O'Hagan's one-man band.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. <user_id=Ilovetopaint> argues that the track ""Micro Disneycal World Tour"" was named in honor of Sean O'Hagan's band, Microdisney, and that this context is relevant to the album. This user believes that the connection between the track name and the band is clear and encyclopedically relevant, especially since Sean O'Hagan remixed the track.

2. <user_id=153.205.69.164> requests a direct source for the claim that the track was named in honor of Microdisney, citing Wikipedia's policy against synthesis of information (WP:SYNTH), which prohibits combining information from multiple sources to imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources.

3. <user_id=Ilovetopaint> insists that the connection is obvious and that the encyclopedic interest lies in the fact that a member of Microdisney remixed a track with a similar name.

4. <user_id=153.205.69.164> stands firm on the need for direct sources and points out that the remix is credited to the High Llamas, not just Sean O'Hagan, which means that attributing the remix solely to O'Hagan is inaccurate.

The quality of the arguments presented by both users varies. <user_id=Ilovetopaint> provides a reasonable argument about the relevance of the connection between the track name and the band, which could be of interest to readers. However, this user does not provide a direct source that explicitly states the track was named in honor of the band, which is a key point in Wikipedia's content guidelines.

<user_id=153.205.69.164> provides a strong argument based on Wikipedia's guidelines, emphasizing the need for direct sources and the avoidance of synthesis. This user also corrects a factual inaccuracy regarding the attribution of the remix, which strengthens their argument.

Overall, the discussion shows a clear engagement with Wikipedia's content policies and a debate over the interpretation of guidelines and the relevance of certain information. Both users are participating in a substantive discussion, although <user_id=153.205.69.164> presents a more rules-based and factually supported argument.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5
"<user_id=Sionk>
Completely agree, recentism, consistency and verifiability wins the day. I put Edmond Safra back because he died in 1999, but that is 15 years ago so I would understand if someone else thought that it was inappropriate. At least it is easy to tell that someone who had $2.5 billion in 1999 was mega rich. I'd be unable to easily make that comparison for someone who died in 1965, like Corm.

<user_id=Bcd3174>
GOODKARMA @Bonadea and Sionk. As I messaged you both, can we please bury the hatchet. We are NOT enemies and I harbor no other intention than making this list as ACCURATE as possible (just like you)! That means that I apologize for past coarse language. It was only a reaction to having all my hard work deleted under really lame arguments (with all due respect). And you should appreciate the (educated) work I put into this page. I happen to know Lebanese wealth inside out. It doesn't work according to Forbes lists or other BS lists that are known to be notoriously incomplete (when not downright WRONG). There are AT LEAST 5 Lebanese billionaires living in Africa that are not included in Forbes and co. nor the list I compiled. Why? Because these guys' fortune, well above 1 billion USD, is unknown. It could be 1, it could be 10. Their assets are ""undercover"". Also, and contrary to you Anglo-Saxon thinking, it is common practice in the Middle East to talk about FAMILIES. Forbes MENA (the regional version of Forbes) recently released its list of ""RICHEST"" and it was a list of... MENA's RICHEST FAMILIES!!! That's the way it works around here: FAMILY WEALTH! Because nobody, including Forbes (!) and hence I trust you will agree neither of you too, can or will ever be able to breakdown the wealth of individual family members. Again, this is how it works around here and if even FORBES approaches the ""issue"" that way, I trust that you guys will have the humbleness to respect that approach too. Getting to Corm, he was the exclusive agent of Ford Motor Cars for the entire Middle East. Everybody in Lebanon knows the Corms are worth billions. But they are a discreet family who have no interest in being in Forbes (which in turn has no way of measuring their fortune hence does not list them). Now either you want to make this page ACCURATE AND FAIR, either you want to just propagate s* intelligence and information, creating a snowball effect that just reinforces Forbes and co. s* lists. Also Bonadea and with all due respect, your date of death logic is BS! Either you consider a man dead and hence don't include him or his family in the list either you do (again, please read above my part on FAMILY WEALTH). But I don't think it is your prerogative to decide what length of death is acceptable or not! If you insist in removing Corm, then you MUST remove Safra and Hayek. If you don't, you have no consistency. And consistency is the key to credibility. And credibility is EXACTLY what Wikipedia lacks. So if your plan is to KILL Wikipedia (whose death I am convinced is around the corner as nobody I know trusts a word coming from Wikipedia, they just use it as a quick info ""fix"" on subjects of little importance to them), continue applying DOUBLE STANDARDS the way you do. I just HATE double standards. They are just about the biggest impediments to OBJECTIVE reporting. Over and out...

<user_id=Sionk>
It would be easier to remove all the dead people, I agree. The redlinked people should probably be removed too, unless there is some proof they exist, are Lebanese and are mega wealthy - WP:LISTPEOPLE applies here. Information needs to be verifiable with no original research, or anyone could make anything up and nobody would be any the wiser.

GOODKARMA Dear Sionk (and Bonadea)! SO glad to be COLLABORATING with you instead of debating with you! Removing the dead people is an option but it would leave out 3 famously rich Lebanese: Hayek, Corm and Safra! Nobody will take this list seriously without them! Trust me. It's like having a list of ""tech gurus"" and not seeing Jobs because he's dead! Unthinkable. As to the redlinked, we all know that that only means that they are not on Wikipedia and is in no way a ""stamp of approval/disproval""! Taha Mikati is redlinked although he is one of the most famous Middle East billionaires. He just doesn't have a Wikiepedia entry. His brother, Najib, does. Does it make sense to ""ban"" him?! I doubt so. The same goes for Haddad and co... Maya Papaya should be removed! I have yet to find ANY proof of her existence... So what do you think guys (girls?!)? I would say keep the dead Hayek, Corm and Safra. As to the redlinked, I believe Taha Mikati and Carlos Haddad definitely have to be in the list. All the other entries apart from those 5 who are either dead of redlinked should probably be removed. Just my humble thoughts. What do my partners (you) think?

<user_id=Bcd3174>
PS: so much more exciting to write an article with the input of smart people than doing research on my own. Warm regards, GK.

<user_id=Sionk>
Until you accept that Wikipedia needs information to be verifiable, we're not going to get anywhere. The most urgent tasks are (1) to write articles/find sources about the redlinked billionaires (assuming they are ""famous"") and (2) to find reliable proof of their wealth.

<user_id=Bcd3174>
GOODKARMA I agree that this article need total reworking. Now who is going to do it? I tried but you kept reverting my research...  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

<user_id=Sionk>
I've already added several news sources. You seem to be here entirely with the purpose of adding your grandfather to the list. If you're the expert, why not find some news sources as proof of the information on the list?

<user_id=Bcd3174>
GOODKARMA Sionk. I am not adding him BECAUSE he is my grandfather but because that is the TRUTH. Should I apologize for having a rich grandfather?! I can't believe I wrote you all those kind messages hoping we could finally work hand in hand and here you go again and just revert all my input with, as the only reply to my messages, a blunt one liner and a concealed threat?!  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

<user_id=Bonadea>
Redlinks are not a problem as such as long as there are sources for the people involved - of course, just as you say, if there are no sources they can't be included. I think, as we have already discussed, that a logical first step would be to remove all the people who are deceased, because including people who are not actual living rich individuals makes very little sense, and as mentioned before, it makes this list different from all the others (which also makes no sense). At the moment, that would mean removing Hayek, Safra and (yet again) Corm. ''''

<user_id=Bcd3174>
Bcd3174 I will dispute any additions to the list as I just edited it unless you come up with proof of the previous 5 billionaires listed. I even took off my grandfather (to Sionk's and Bonadea's satisfaction). On Wikipedia, the burden on the proof lies on the person ADDING information. I am here to make sure that that burden lies on those it is suppose to. Over and out...  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

Bcd3174 This list is a pile of BS! No Hayek?! No Safra?! You have just demeaned Wikipedia to the status of s* repository of FALSE information! Well done!

<user_id=Bcd3174>
Bcd3174 This page is now and finally in accordance with several leading sources on Lebanese wealth. All entries are supported by reliable sources and the people in the list are all household names in Lebanon. We will never reach PERFECTION. This is probably as good a list as it gets. Please do not change it. Thanks.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

<user_id=Bonadea>
This source (mentioned above on this page) has been removed again, together with two entries supported by it. It does not appear to meet the requirements for a reliable source; the good people over at the reliable sources noticeboard might have more input on this, however. Since there is no consensus to include people who are deceased, Charles Corm (who died in 1963) cannot be included here.  ''''

<user_id=Bonadea>
Input has been requested at the Reliable Sources noticeboard. ''''

<user_id=Diannaa>
I don't think that website should be used. It's a self-published source. Wikipedia uses third-party sources such as reliable well known newspapers like Forbes or the New York Times. I agree the list should only include living people.

<user_id=Bonadea>
Thanks, I'm glad to see that my thinking here seems to be in line with WP:RS. ''''

<user_id=Sionk>
Interesting to see one of the main contributors to MENAopportunities.info is Charles Corm.

<user_id=Sionk>
Tried unsuccessfully to find a mention online of the Middle East Wealth Study 2014, which is the alleged source of the MENAopportunities list. However, I found a Middle East Wealth Study 2013 by Camden Wealth/QFC (Qatar Financial Center?). This describes people and families only in general terms, no specific wealth list. I'll be curious to know who published the 2014 study, and where.

",0,"The discussion revolves around the inclusion of certain individuals in a Wikipedia list of wealthy Lebanese people. The main points of contention are the inclusion of deceased individuals, the reliability of sources, and the verifiability of the wealth of the individuals listed.

Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Recentism, Consistency, and Verifiability**: User Sionk emphasizes the importance of recentism, consistency, and verifiability, suggesting that individuals who have passed away a long time ago may not be appropriate for the list. This is a valid point as Wikipedia guidelines prioritize current and verifiable information.

2. **Family Wealth and Regional Practices**: User Bcd3174 argues that in the Middle East, wealth is often considered at the family level rather than the individual level, and that some wealthy individuals may not be listed in well-known sources like Forbes. This is a culturally relevant point, but it still requires verifiable sources to meet Wikipedia's standards.

3. **Redlinked Individuals**: Both users agree that redlinked individuals (those without a Wikipedia article) can be included if there are reliable sources to verify their existence and wealth. This is in line with Wikipedia's guidelines.

4. **Burden of Proof**: User Sionk insists on the need for verifiable proof of wealth, which is a core principle of Wikipedia. Without reliable sources, information cannot be included.

5. **Inclusion of Deceased Individuals**: User Bonadea suggests removing deceased individuals to maintain consistency with other lists and because the list is meant to reflect current wealthy individuals. This is a logical approach to maintain the list's relevance and accuracy.

6. **Reliability of Sources**: User Diannaa points out that self-published sources are not considered reliable on Wikipedia, and third-party sources like Forbes or the New York Times are preferred. This is a critical point for maintaining the integrity of the information on Wikipedia.

7. **Verification of Alleged Source**: User Sionk's attempt to verify the Middle East Wealth Study 2014, which was used as a source by Bcd3174, shows due diligence in ensuring the reliability of the information being added to the list.

Overall, the discussion shows a mix of strong adherence to Wikipedia's guidelines by some users and a desire to include culturally relevant practices by others. The arguments presented by Sionk, Bonadea, and Diannaa are well-grounded in Wikipedia's policies and emphasize the need for reliable, third-party sources and verifiability. Bcd3174's arguments, while culturally insightful, lack the necessary adherence to Wikipedia's standards for source reliability and verifiability.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

United States 3

<user_id=Arthur Rubin>
The United States section consists of (IMO, excessive) quotes, without adequate context to verify that they are relating to what ''we'' call ""plutocracy"".  Furthermore, they are form a minority, if not WP:FRINGE, opinion, and should be balanced by reliable opinions which deny the claim that the US forms a plutocracy.  —

<user_id=2605:A000:F2C0:A400:CD9:4B89:6296:F4F6>
Is New York Times a fringe source?  Feel free to add sources stating a counter-argument.

<user_id=Pincrete>
If I can chip in here - for various reasons - since, ''(as the article itself points out)'' Plutocracy is inherently a perjorative term, and inherently has a strong element of value judgement about it, either including or omitting ANY country in a list seems fairly unproductive. What does seem productive is to put forward the character of the arguments that informed/articulate/reliable sources have made. I largely sympathise with Arthur Rubin and agree that the references to the US are excessive and fairly rambling. There are many pages where similar discussions COULD take place, but crucially, for example a page on democracy should inform as to the history of the idea and practice of democracy, should use examples of the success or failure of systems of democracy etc. .... It SHOULDN""T get itself bogged down in whether this or that place was or was not a democracy, which does seem to be what is happening here.

<user_id=EllenCT>
What precisely about the sources and charts describing the US do you find ""excessive and fairly rambling""? What is your assessment of their accuracy and agreement with the peer reviewed literature reviews?

<user_id=Collect>
The sources, for one thing, do ''not'' call the US government a ""plutocracy"" and I regret that you are backing edits made by an edit warring IP at this point.   Aside from the sources '''not backing the claims made''', the new Princeton study has not been widely cited  nor accepted by others - in any contentious matters, a study which is cited by others is a better source.  Cheers.

<user_id=Pincrete>
''EllenCT''', I presume your questions above were directed at me, since you quote me. Firstly I don't anywhere in what I said question the reliability of the sources, at least one source is published by Cam Univ Press, and ''(as far as I know)'' is completely academically legit. ... other sources I know nothing about, however I DIDN""T QUESTION the sources. To answer your other question, how am I expected to 'identify precisely' what is 'fairly rambling', isn't that a bit of a contradiction in terms?

<user_id=Pincrete>
My main point above is that this is meant to be an article about Plutocracy, not an article about whether the US ''(or the UK or anywhere else)'' is or is not a plutocracy. In my own personal opinion ''(as a Brit)'', I am astonished by the extent to which the whole American political process ''(from 3500+ miles away)'', seems governed by money, campaign money, TV advertising etc., so I am fairly sympathetic to the accusation that disproportionate power lies in the hands of the very wealthy /big corporations /media giants. However, I wonder whether the innocent reader coming to this page wanting clues as to what plutocracy was as a concept, would want detailed charts on economic inequality in the US or income levels of US Senators. Perhaps this material does belong SOMEWHERE, and should be linked to here, but I wonder how useful/enlightening, beyond the general assertion that the US has been accused of/is sometimes seen as plutocratic is on THIS page. If you went to a page on Democracy would you really expect half of the page to be devoted to arguments about whether the UK monarchy, should or should not be called a democracy, or whether China was meaningfully a democracy? I don't think so, beyond recording that such discussions exist and pointing you towards those discussions.

<user_id=Pincrete>
My other point is that the word is inherently perjorative, and to a very large extent subjective, therefore no two people are ever going to agree as to whether this place or that place is plutocratic any more than they are going to agree about what is or is not ugly!

<user_id=EllenCT>
Do you think Oligarchy is a superior location for inclusion? How about Income inequality in the United States and United States politics?

<user_id=EllenCT>
Do you think that the sources for the charts are sufficiently cited?

<user_id=Collect>
That is a task for the editors ''on those topics'' to arrive at a consensus for.  Cheers.

Is there a better page on which to discuss the modern plutocratic leanings of the United States?  I think this is a real issue that effects many people worldwide that ought to be discussed.  As an American I am deeply sickened that we spend so much tax money on overthrowing governments in other countries, bailing out corporations that deserve to fail, inefficient biofuels from corn, more wars to fix the problems we created from overthrowing governments in other countries, keeping nonviolent and mentally ill people in jails, sexually assaulting the elderly in airports, giving tax breaks to people who don't deserve or need them, and not nearly enough to fix the impossible national debt that threatens the nation's very existence.  None of these issues would occur in a direct democracy setting, and very few of these issues would occur if money and lobbyists were strictly barred from the political realm.  Can we make a page specifically to discuss the problems that the United States has with money in politics?

<user_id=2605:A000:F2C0:A400:404:D21C:890A:A7EB>
I think there needs to be an ""America's got problems"" page.  There can be a section on lobbyists, a section on citizens united, a section on laws being created in secret trade deals like the TPP, a section on unrestricted political campaign contributions, a section on corporate person-hood, etc.

<user_id=Pincrete>
''EllenCT''' firstly, apologies, the 'charts on income levels of US Senators' are in a link you made above not in THIS article, it was late when I wrote that and memory let me down when trying to think of an example of excessive detail. Where should this material be? I don't know as I am insufficiently knowledgeable about these pages and am only here at all by foolishly getting involved in tidying up some UK references.

<user_id=Pincrete>
I disagree with some other editors to this extent however, although these pieces of research may be recent, ''(and although they may or may not be the most authorative available)'', nevertheless, the argument as to whether the voter or powerful interest groups control a country is probably as old as time, as is the argument as to whether political decisions are made to benefit the country/populace or simply in the interest of those powerful groups ''(Government of/by/for the economically powerful)''. Therefore this page could legitimately report that this debate exists, we don't have to take sides or to wait until the majority of economic/political commentators agree on the subject. On a related point - for a variety of reasons - no state has ever described itself as a plutocracy, so if we aren't careful, we will inevitably come to the conclusion that no state is/was or has ever been described as plutocratic, except those of which every potential defender has long since disappeared into history.

After reviewing some of the sourcing, I've re-added some of the material that has been removed without a policy-based rationale. The sources all appear to meet RS, and some are academic, being published as recently as a month ago.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The initial concern raised by Arthur Rubin is about the balance and context of the quotes used in the article, suggesting that they may represent a fringe opinion and that there should be a balance with sources that deny the US is a plutocracy. This is a valid point in ensuring that Wikipedia articles remain neutral and well-balanced.

2. The user with the IP address 2605:A000:F2C0:A400:CD9:4B89:6296 challenges the fringe label by questioning if the New York Times is considered a fringe source and invites the addition of counter-arguments. This is a constructive response, acknowledging the need for diverse perspectives without directly addressing the issue of balance.

3. Pincrete adds to the discussion by suggesting that the focus of the article should be on the concept of plutocracy rather than debating whether specific countries are plutocracies. This is a relevant point for maintaining the encyclopedic nature of the article.

4. EllenCT asks for clarification on what is considered ""excessive and fairly rambling"" and inquires about the accuracy and agreement with peer-reviewed literature. This is a request for more specific criticism and evidence, which is a reasonable approach to improving the article.

5. Collect points out that the sources do not explicitly label the US government as a ""plutocracy"" and that the Princeton study mentioned has not been widely cited or accepted, which is a valid concern for the reliability and weight of the sources used.

6. Pincrete further explains that the term ""plutocracy"" is perjorative and subjective, which makes it difficult to reach a consensus on whether a country is plutocratic. This is an important consideration for how the information is presented in the article.

7. EllenCT suggests alternative locations for the discussion of the US's plutocratic leanings, such as other related articles. This is a constructive suggestion for maintaining the focus of the Plutocracy article while still addressing the concerns raised.

8. The user with the IP address 2605:A000:F2C0:A400:404:D21C:890A:A7EB expresses a desire for a dedicated page to discuss the problems with money in US politics. While this is a valid concern, it may not directly contribute to the improvement of the Plutocracy article.

9. Goethean and Ubikwit provide brief suggestions for where the content could be placed or support the re-addition of material based on the reliability of sources. These are practical contributions to the discussion.

Overall, the discussion shows a range of perspectives with participants providing reasoned arguments for their positions. There is a clear concern for maintaining neutrality, source reliability, and relevance to the topic of plutocracy. The participants are engaging with each other's points, although there is some repetition and not all points are fully addressed or resolved.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Neutral point of view

<user_id=Cmguy777>
The slavery section is controversial, and it should be neutral. I have been trying to get it neutral enough. The term ""whippings"" should be used in the article. Yes. We can do better. Washington made a fortune from slavery and land speculation. There is one catch with Washington, his 1799 abolition will. Washington may have had a conscious concerning slavery. In his will he freed all his slaves, after his wifes death, and gave them the right to remain in Virginia, not to be deported to some freedman's colony. His wife Martha freed his slaves in 1801. His money went into the care of taking care of his elderly freed slaves. Now this does not make up for the ""whippings"", the slavery, and profiteering. We should not ""preach"" to the reader, but rather just present the facts. How Washington felt is pure speculation.

<user_id=Yopienso>
I was ashamed an editor failed to accept your constructive criticism on the FAC and have urged him to reconsider. Ironically, I now find myself in the position of rejecting your criticism. I wholeheartedly agree the article isn't of a high enough quality to be designated a FA. I'm troubled by your approach here, however, on a subject you didn't mention on the FAC page: you assert, ""This article comes across as an accolade to a racist.""

<user_id=Yopienso>
I can't agree to writing this (or any) article from a presentist view. We may mention that some people today view Washington as a racist, because there is a trend in modern thought of applying that term in ways never imagined a few decades ago. Well and good, but ''Wikipedia'' follows current mainstream academic views. Ron Chernow, who represents the academic view, informed readers on p. 111 of his 2011 Pulitzer prize-winning biography, ''Washington: A Life,'' ""However horrifying it seems to later generations, abominable behavior toward dark-skinned people was considered an acceptable way of life."" On p. 6 he wrote, ""George Washington entered a strictly hierarchical universe [...] As the economic basis of this undemocratic world, slavery was commonplace and unquestioned..."" On p. 8, ""Like her future husband, Martha Dandridge grew up in a world where slavery was taken for granted...""
While I'm utterly opposed to hagiographies, I can't agree to portray GW as a racist or a torturer. We should portray him in the context of the world in which he lived. This does a far greater service to our readers than a judgmental view applying 21st-century ideas to the actions of 18th-century people. Here are excerpts from an excellent essay, ""Against Presentism,"" by Lynn Hunt:
Who isn't [against presentism], you say? Hardly any ism"" these days has much of a scholarly following.""
Over time, modernity became the standard of judgment against which most of the past, even the Western past, could be found wanting.
Presentism, at its worst, encourages a kind of moral complacency and self-congratulation. Interpreting the past in terms of present concerns usually leads us to find ourselves morally superior; the Greeks had slavery, even David Hume was a racist, and European women endorsed imperial ventures. Our forbears constantly fail to measure up to our present-day standards. This is not to say that any of these findings are irrelevant or that we should endorse an entirely relativist point of view. It is to say that we must question the stance of temporal superiority that is implicit in the Western (and now probably worldwide) historical discipline.
Respect for the past, with its concomitant humility, curiosity, and even wonder . . . enables us to see beyond our present-day concerns backward and forward at the same time.  					False

We should avoid presentism, but we should also avoid apologetics for slavery too. Chernow's opinion of Washington and slavery is not set in stone just because he won the Pulitzer. Chernow's ''dark-skinned'' quote is a bit dated and a generalization of African people. There were plenty of abolitionsists, Methodists and Baptists, in Washington's times and in his will Washington rejected slavery. Readers are free to judge Washington in any manner desired. Wikipedia is to present Washington as neutral as possible.  					False

4	2018-06-30 09:05:10	Yopienso	Certainly we shouldn't draw from or refer only to Chernow! He's a good source, though, and a good example of modern mainstream scholarship. Please read his chapter A Certain Species of Property"" for an excellent example of even-handed narration that neither extols nor condemns. You're familiar with our deep bibliography.
Wrt ""apologetics for slavery,"" I agree with Hunt: ""Interpreting the past in terms of present concerns usually leads us to find ourselves morally superior."" Imho, the main narrative should be as neutral as humanly possible, avoiding either a judgmental or an apologetic tone.
A ""Historical reputation"" section is valuable to show what people thought of Washington in his day, soon after his death, during the 19th and 20th centuries, and today. The task here is to find a reputable modern scholar who calls GW a racist who tortured slaves. And if you find one, we have to see how the academy has received her or him.

Graham Beards is entitled to Graham Beards' view of Washington. The task is to get George Washington to FA.

<user_id=Gwillhickers>
The slavery section was basically the same in terms of neutrality when the article was a FAC, yet none of the reviewers tagged the article for neutrality. There was not even a hint of any ""accolade to a racist"" during the review. Overnight one of the former reviewers tagged the article, and then removed it. Why wasn't the article tagged during the review? Simply because time wasn't taken to really read the article??

<user_id=Gwillhickers>
Some of the above comments give us a clear reason why we need to present controversial issues in context. In the future, we should insist on reviewers who do not harbor such a flagrant bias and dislike against the subject. I was surprised to read GB's comments. In any case, no one denies that there's no improvements needed in any of the grammar, and the citations and sources are coming up to speed. It would be nice, btw, if as much attention was given to cites and sources (there are still a fair number that need attention) as is being given these highly opinionated issues. As for any apologetic tone, this seems to be aimed at anything that puts the issue of slavery in human context. Slavery was wrong, virtually everyone acknowledge that, but there were realities about simply releasing slaves, with no means of support, shelter, etc,  into ""freedom"". As for ""racism"", everyone was a ""racist"", and favored their own kind and culture, which is largely true today, esp in the old world. So it's almost funny when some refer to Washington as  some freak of society in this regard. Washington, like everyone else, was a product of his time, where family and national preservation came first. With common place war, infant mortality, disease, and a cruel and unforgiving world, civil rights issues barely existed then. Still, some struggled with the idea of slavery regardless. Unfortunately too many modern day TV viewers don't get that. Having said that, we say what the sources say, like it or not.

This article suffers from American historical amnesia, (Google it).  American's have a view of history that is not shared by the world. (For example,  they did not win WW2, for that we needed the  Russians and  English Enigma code breakers.) As for ""presentism"" ,  the history of  the USA is shallow; my house, from which I am writing this, is older than the USA.   I would be ashamed to see a portrait of Washington on my money, and I suspect most African-Americans would agree with me.  We have a saying in the the UK that Americans think $100 is lot of money whereas the British think a hundred miles is a long way away. Please stop idolising  Washington; he was of his time, an astute militarian and politician.  He was not a nice person.  I do not like the way the article celebrates the man; his faults, which were many, need to be given equal weight.

<user_id=Gwillhickers>
Yes, we've acknowledged citation issues more times than I care to count and have been working on them all along – and thanks so much for your revealing opinions. It's a little ironic that you were the one who initiated this section, entitled  ''Neutral point of view''. The ""history of the USA is shallow""?? Really.. The American Revolution inspired revolutions around the world, starting with the French Revolution. Washington risked his very life, in many instances, (no big deal, huh?) to achieve independence from Britain. In many cases he suffered right along side his troops through harsh winters. He was fundamental in advancing a world premier government run by the people, not someone of ""divine right"". His ownership of slaves doesn't change these things one bit. We have an entire section on slavery, but you are welcomed to include any other ""faults"" that we may have overlooked, but I'm afraid this will require reading, time and effort on your part, and will also require citations from reliable sources. In any case, you obviously shouldn't have been a reviewer for this particular article. Where were these opinions when you made your initial review? We need neutral and objective assessments, not hostile and shortsighted views. Thanks for the experience.

<user_id=Cmguy777>
I hope we are not here to argue the merits of monarchy/democracy or the ""divine right of Kings"", and we can concentrate on George Washington. I will agree with Graham Beards. Washington was not a ""nice person"". The article should not celebrate slavery either. The subject of slavery goes back to the founding of the colonies. I believe the British Kings, or Queens, or Lord Protectors permitted the colonists to own Indian and African slaves. Were there slaves in England under the Roman Britain ? Even Isaac Newton may have invested in the slave trade in the West Indies. Many questions can be asked. Probably everyone back then was involved in the slave trade somehow. Washington was different, at the end. He set all his slaves free in his will, on condition of his wifes death, who set his slaves free in 1801. Washington also allowed his slaves to stay in Virginia, not be shipped to some freedman's colonies. That suggests Washington thought blacks and whites could live together as free persons. Slavery was/is a cruel institution.

<user_id=Cmguy777>
We are not here to discuss whether the ""history of the USA is shallow"" either, which is why divine right v democracy was mentioned. The section does not ""celebrate"" slavery. Where are you getting the notion that it does? Because we mention context? Also, most if not all the sources speak of Washington as a benevolent person, in spite of his faults. ""Not a nice person""?  If you really need other leaders to put Washington in a proper perspective start with Stalin, Hitler, Pol-Pot, Genghis Khan, Saddam Husein — leaders that committed crimes against humanity far worse than slavery in America. Some young minds never survived the 60's and late 20th century evidently.
I am not trying to begrudge anything: but this is a good article: Slavery in the British and French Caribbean British slavery ended in 1833. Slavery in America, except a punishiment for (a) crime(s), was abolished in 1865.
These articles are good: Slavery in Britain, Slavery in the colonial United States, and Slavery in the United States.
Slavery was often times cruel, but more than often it was not. Fighting wars was ten times as cruel. Jefferson gives us a classic example of how slaves were well taken care of, worked no more than free farmers, allowed to raise their own chickens and produce, had Sundays, Christmas and Easter off, encouraged to attend church, and didn't do much in the late autumn and winter months, but were still well fed and provided for. Admittedly, Washington could have done better. In cities like Philadelphia, New York and Boston, Africans were taken in as house servants by mostly Christian families who detested slavery. These blacks were commonly referred to by other blacks as ""house niggers"". Abolitionist John Brown couldn't get a following of slaves because he couldn't convince them they would be better off following him. Most slaves didn't like slavery, (any more than dirt farmers didn't like their situation) but they weren't naive either. Activists and the 'friends of America' crowd don't want to tell you that part of the story for fear it will let a lot of hot air out of their socio-political balloons. Are we ready to get back to work and resume taking care of the real problems?

Can you fix ref #194? I don't know how. It says ""Chernow Ferling 2009"" and goes to nothing. Thanks!

<user_id=Cmguy777>
Gwillhickers. We need to get concensus for George Washington to get FA. Graham Beards was one of the reviewers. ""Slavery was often times cruel, but more than often it was not."" does not help matters. Washington was not a ""''nice guy''"". He was a general and a plantation owner who drove the slaves to work. Whatever your views on slavery you have every right to have. But any personal views, including my own, on Washington and slavery should not hold up FA. Whipping slaves was the cruelty. Washington, for that matter, was the slaves King. The slaves had no rights, only privileges, at the mercy of their owners.

Thank you kindly!

<user_id=Gwillhickers>
Given his last tirade against Washington and America, GB is out of the picture as far as objective reviewing is concerned. He seems to forget that it was Britain that was among the first to introduce slaves to the colonies. It was British shipping that was once at the center of the slave trade, while it was Britain who sold arms to the Confederacy during the Civil War all the while they were enjoying the fruits of slavery with the cotton they so desperately needed for their textile industry. And wasn't Britain once a young country? I can't believe he slighted a country for being young. Otoh, you don't help the article with your apparent refusal to acknowledge more than a 60's flat-earth assessment of slavery. We say what the sources say. No one has ""idolized"" Washington in the article. The section does not ""celebrate"" slavery in the slavery section. Please get a handle on these notions.  Washington sometimes had individual slaves whipped, but not in a frequency or in a manner you apparently would  have us believe, as such punishment was exceptional. Often the whippings were switching in the legs and hind quarters. Brutally whipping a slave to a bloody pulp for simply being idol would disable the slave from work, and of course create dissent among the other slaves and inspire more runaways big time. Think. There are very few accounts of such excess, let alone brutality. We need to keep presentist views out of the article and say what the sources say, which we've been doing all along. The sources say Washington frowned on excess. The only real problem is creating issues where none exist. Presentism.

<user_id=Gwillhickers>
There is citation and sourcing issues that still need attending to. I've noticed good work is being done on some of the grammar and wording, while the context remains intact. We should also look for any errors in dates, names and places that may exist — it's a big article. You might not know it from some of the talk flying around here, but we have made giant steps forward.

<user_id=Cmguy777>
For the sake of compromise I would add keeping both presentism and apologetics out of the article.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. The discussion revolves around the portrayal of George Washington in an article, specifically concerning his relationship with slavery. The participants are debating how to present this information neutrally, without presentism (judging past events by today's standards) or apologetics (defending or excusing the actions).

2. User Graham Beards raises concerns about American historical amnesia and the portrayal of Washington, suggesting that the article should not idolize him and should give equal weight to his faults.

3. User Cmguy777 emphasizes the importance of neutrality and acknowledges that while Washington was not a ""nice person,"" he did free his slaves in his will, which could suggest a complex view on slavery.

4. User Yopienso argues against presentism and for portraying Washington in the context of his time, citing historian Lynn Hunt and the academic view represented by Ron Chernow.

5. User Gwillhickers defends the neutrality of the slavery section and argues for the importance of context when discussing controversial issues. He also points out that the article has not idolized Washington and that the slavery section does not celebrate slavery.

6. User Shearonink contributes by fixing citation errors, which is a practical step towards improving the article's quality.

7. The discussion includes references to historical facts, academic perspectives, and the importance of context. There is a clear effort to balance the portrayal of Washington, acknowledging his role in slavery while also recognizing his actions in freeing his slaves.

8. The participants are engaged in a substantive debate about historical interpretation, the use of sources, and the application of Wikipedia's neutrality policy. While there are disagreements, the discussion is focused on improving the article and adhering to Wikipedia's standards.

9. The quality of the arguments varies, with some participants providing more nuanced and source-based arguments, while others express more personal or emotional views. However, the overall discussion is constructive and aimed at reaching a consensus on how to present a balanced view of a historical figure.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Myofascial Meridians revived, NPOV

<user_id=Technophant>
I've revived this discussion from archive. With the above arguments in consideration, as well as some new sources I've reworked long-standing and un-challenged content form myofascial meridians into this article in the section regarding research. It was awkward trying insert this into what looks like an very calculated and systemic attack on the fundamentals of TCM. Accordingly I added the the NPOV banner because there's no way this article in the way it sits now can be called neutral by community standards. -

<user_id=QuackGuru>
On the contrary, the content from the other article is challenged. Did you read this diff? See Talk:Acupuncture#Sourced text was deleted.

<user_id=Alexbrn>
In the context of the mainstream, ""myofascial meridians"" appears to be a fringe concept with one mention only in a dodgy (chiropractic) journal, according to a PubMed search. If that is so, it is doubtful that Myofascial meridians should exist, and it would certainly be undue to mention it here.  ||

<user_id=QuackGuru>
I was thinking the same thing. AFD?

<user_id=Alexbrn>
I have asked at WP:FT/N.  ||

<user_id=MrBill3>
Some clear specifics are needed to support an NPOV tag and discussion. This article is extensively discussed and worked out on this talk page. The content reflects well reviewed material based on evaluated sources. The article has been developed through extensive consensus building. An NPOV tag for the entire article based on a single editors vague assertion is not appropriate.

<user_id=MrBill3>
Myofascial meridians and referred pain along such meridians as support for evidence of acupuncture meridians from a single researcher over five years ago without replication and recognition in academia is not a valid basis for content. Did Dorsher's 2009 publications lead to mainstream academia and medical science recognizing and accepting acupuncture meridians as having an anatomical basis? If so provide some sources that state that. The high quality sources that review the effectiveness of acupuncture that I have read all make reference to meridians as unsupported theory. One author getting published once in a reputable journal does not create the current medical understanding on a topic, especially if after five years there is no substantial validation. ''The Journal of Pain'' has published more on acupuncture since Dorsher's article and they don't seem reflect an acceptance of anatomical correlation. - -

<user_id=MrBill3>
To quote Pigliucci and Boudrey, ""Asma’s example of Chinese medicine’s claims about the existence of 'Qi' energy, channeled through the human body by way of 'meridians,' though, is a different matter. This sounds scientific, because it uses arcane jargon that gives the impression of articulating explanatory principles. But there is no way to test the existence of Qi and associated meridians, or to establish a viable research program based on those concepts, for the simple reason that talk of Qi and meridians only looks substantive, but it isn’t even in the ballpark of an empirically verifiable theory."" - -

It's pseudoscientific piffle which should probably be deleted, not merged.

@Mallexikon, here's a reliable secondary source (editorial control and fact checking) from the WSJ stating: ""Many of the 365 acupuncture points correspond to nerve bundles or muscle trigger points. Several meridians track major arteries and nerves."" That statement and source, with Dorser's Journal of Pain article cited for background and further info should be sufficient. It does not contradict the 2008 review being these are recent findings. -

The Wall Street Journal is a great source in general, but should not be used for medical claims per MEDRS. -

<user_id=Jayaguru-Shishya>
I find WSJ far more reliable than blogs by different news sites.

<user_id=Second Quantization>
You are missing the point. ''All news sites suck'' for medical claims and they are also shoddy for science claims (WSJ in particular).

<user_id=Jayaguru-Shishya>
Blogs  are  being  used  as  a  source  in  other  alt  med  articles,  like  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic#cite_note-Brown2014-214 .  I'd like to see both discarded, but it is apparent that WSJ is more reliable than some ''blog'' in a newspaper.

<user_id=Second Quantization>
No it does not follow. WSJ is garbage, but its possible that a blog could be much more reliable, particularly if written by a scientist blogging for example, WP:USERG:""''Some news outlets host interactive columns they call blogs, and these may be acceptable as sources so long as the writers are professional journalists or are professionals in the field on which they write and the blog is subject to the news outlet's full editorial control.''"". But anyway, newspapers are not generally reliable for medical claims.

<user_id=BullRangifer>
, you are failing to make a difference between MEDRS type content and non-MEDRS content. The sourcing rules are not the same. Brown's source is not used to support medical claims, but the opinions of a noted expert on the intersection between spirituality and chiropractic. That's actually a huge area, since chiropractic was created on the basis of a religious seance, and D.D. Palmer later (1911) considered making it a religion. Brown's comments have nothing to do with medical claims, so that content is not governed by the MEDRS guideline. MEDRS only covers medical claims, no matter which article at Wikipedia. It does not govern non-medical claims, even in medical articles. You have previously seemed to fail to understand this. I hope you understand it now so we don't have to continually explain it to you. It has also been explained to you that we don't deprecate a source just because its a blog. Blogs by experts and journalists are often used as RS here. So please stop your obsession with not using blogs since you clearly do not understand that issue either. I'm really beginning to wonder if you aren't an incarnation of  / .

<user_id=Technophant>
A news source can be used to show that there's a debate. If language such as ""According to the Wall Street Journal: Many of the 365 acupuncture points correspond to nerve bundles or muscle trigger points. Several meridians track major arteries and nerves."" that should be acceptable. It doesn't make a clear medical claim, rather shows that other opinions exist. -

<user_id=Technophant>
Abusing MEDRS to cover a minority scientific opinion does not comply with this directive: ""1a) Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, a fundamental policy, '''requires''' fair representation of significant alternatives to scientific orthodoxy. Significant alternatives, in this case, refers to legitimate scientific disagreement, as opposed to pseudoscience.""This guideline supports the general sourcing policy at Wikipedia:Verifiability with specific attention given to sources appropriate for the medical and health-related content in any type of article, including alternative medicine. Sources for all other types of content—including all non-medical information in medicine-related articles—are covered by the general guideline on identifying reliable sources rather than this specific guideline."" Controversy among researchers, historical background, and opinions about acupuncture don't strictly fit the definition of ""bio-medical information"". -

<user_id=2over0>
Technophant, you misunderstand what is meant by ""making a medical claim"". Please reread the guideline. -

",0,"The discussion revolves around the inclusion of content related to myofascial meridians in the context of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and acupuncture on Wikipedia. The participants are debating the neutrality of the article, the reliability of sources, and the appropriateness of the content based on Wikipedia's guidelines, particularly the MEDRS guideline, which pertains to the use of reliable sources for medical claims.

1. Technophant revives a discussion and suggests that the article is not neutral, proposing the addition of content about myofascial meridians. They also add an NPOV (Neutral Point of View) banner to the article.

2. QuackGuru and Alexbrn question the reliability of the concept of myofascial meridians and suggest that it may be a fringe theory not supported by mainstream medical science.

3. MrBill3 argues that the article has been developed through consensus and that the myofascial meridians concept lacks substantial validation in mainstream academia and medical science. They also cite Pigliucci and Boudrey to support the argument that Qi and meridians are not empirically verifiable theories.

4. BullRangifer dismisses the concept as pseudoscientific and suggests deletion rather than merging.

5. Technophant cites a Wall Street Journal article to support the existence of a correlation between acupuncture points and anatomical structures, but 2over0 and Second Quantization counter that news outlets are not reliable sources for medical claims according to MEDRS.

6. Jayaguru-Shishya and BullRangifer discuss the use of blogs as sources, with BullRangifer clarifying that the context of the source's use (MEDRS vs. non-MEDRS content) determines its appropriateness.

7. Technophant argues that a news source can be used to show that there is a debate and that not all content related to acupuncture falls under the strict definition of ""bio-medical information.""

8. 2over0 points out that Technophant may misunderstand what constitutes a medical claim according to the guidelines.

The quality of the arguments varies. Some participants, like MrBill3 and BullRangifer, provide clear reasoning based on Wikipedia's guidelines and the scientific consensus. They also differentiate between types of claims and the appropriate sources for each. Others, like Technophant, attempt to introduce sources that may not meet the MEDRS standard for medical claims but argue for their inclusion based on the representation of alternative views.

Overall, the discussion is robust, with participants citing specific guidelines and policies, and there is a clear effort to maintain the integrity of the article based on Wikipedia's standards. However, there is also some confusion or disagreement about the application of these standards, particularly regarding what constitutes a medical claim and the reliability of certain types of sources.

Considering the depth of the discussion, the engagement with Wikipedia's policies, and the effort to clarify misunderstandings, the average quality of arguments is relatively high. However, the persistent disagreement and occasional confusion about guidelines slightly lower the overall quality.

Final 11.1 Beta

<user_id=D4R1U5>
I know that’s edit warring, but some people don’t understand that betas are not official releases. Wait till it releases officially, like next week or something. Be patient. (By the way iOS 11 has 10 betas).

<user_id=D4R1U5>
YOU are pretty sure, but do you have a confirmation from Apple? WP:SPECULATION. That’s it.

<user_id=KamranMackey>
No, but why does that matter? Apple has left the 3D touch app switcher ability in for 3 betas since 11.1 Beta 2. That's a pretty big sign that they AREN'T going to remove it. So I think I'm allowed to write that it was re-added in Beta 2. That's all there is to it. You can't keep reverting everybody's edits just because it doesn't flow well with you dude, that's called edit warring. Anyways, back to the question, I do think beta 5 is the final beta, and that's because I've been using the iOS betas for a while now, and I've studied how Apple releases their betas. It's usually a 4-5 beta cycle with minor updates (11.x, not 11.x.x) and a smaller beta cycle with smaller updates (11.x.x), and a larger cycle with major iOS updates. (Example being iOS 11 had 10 betas before it was released to the public, and iOS 10 had 8 or so) -   ·

<user_id=KamranMackey>
Lots of people understand what beta means. Sure, some people don't, but a lot of people do. And why should I wait until next week to re-write something I already wrote? There's no reason why I should. I've edited Wikipedia a lot. I think that me writing that it was re-added in beta 2 is perfectly fine. And actually, since released by Apple, they are official releases, just not completely 100% stable, and on a different channel from ""stable"". They are still official releases however. -   ·

<user_id=D4R1U5>
Betas are not official releases, they are meant for testing. Sometimes, Apple adds features in early betas, and then removed them in some later ones. You don’t have proof that beta 5 is the GM. And that’s why you are not allowed to add it until the final version. WP:SPECULATION.

<user_id=KamranMackey>
When there is no letter at the end of a version number string in iOS beta versions (Example: Beta 3 had the version string 15B5086a, while Beta 5 has the version string 15B93), that's an indication that it's the GM. I've done my studying, so you're incorrect. -   ·

<user_id=D4R1U5>
Wikipedia is not based on independent study or rumors. You need to source everything. For things like this, you need an official source (from Apple), not from any third-party site. You never know, Apple may suddenly release another beta. Why can’t you just wait for a few more days (less than a week), till the stable release comes out. WP:ORIGINAL applies.

<user_id=KamranMackey>
What I said isn't based on independent study or rumors. It's based on facts. Beta 10 of iOS 11 was the Golden Master AND the final release, with the exception of the GM & final release having the ""a"" omitted from the Beta 10 version string (15A5372a/15A5372). I think I know what I'm talking about. Beta 5 of iOS 11.1 is the Golden Master. -   ·

<user_id=D4R1U5>
If there ''are'' some last minute bugs that need fixing, Apple may release another beta. You '''can't''' be sure without an official source.

<user_id=KamranMackey>
There's a calculator bug, but that's minor and Apple isn't going to release an updated GM for that tiny bug. -   ·

<user_id=D4R1U5>
. Can you guys please provide your opinion on whether it is appropriate to keep this before the official release?

<user_id=D4R1U5>
Check this and this.

<user_id=Guy Harris>
As the saying goes, it ain't over 'till it's over.

<user_id=Guy Harris>
Maybe ""Beta 10 of iOS 11 was the Golden Master AND the final release, with the exception of the GM & final release having the ""a"" omitted from the Beta 10 version string (15A5372a/15A5372)"", but we need a ''citation'' on that, not a ""I think I know what I'm talking about."" claim.  Apple doesn't say anything obvious about that on developer.apple.com; if you have a citation, let's see it.  (And it's been a while since I retired from Apple 6 years ago, but, from my days as a Core OS software engineer, I don't remember offhand any case where they dropped the letter at the end of the build number, rather than bumping the build number; as I remember, that letter is for minor tweaks to a build that don't involve a complete build of all the projects, and going from 15A5372a to 15A5372 would mean that the GM was missing those tweaks.)

<user_id=Guy Harris>
So I'd personally wait for 11.1 to come out before we talk about what is, or isn't, in it, anywhere other than the 11.1 beta section of iOS version history.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Understanding of Wikipedia Policies**: Both users demonstrate an understanding of Wikipedia's policies regarding speculation and the need for official sources. User D4R1U5 emphasizes the importance of not adding information based on speculation and insists on waiting for an official release from Apple. User KamranMackey argues that the pattern of version strings without a letter at the end indicates a Golden Master (GM) release, which is a reasonable inference but still speculative without official confirmation.

2. **Evidence and Precedent**: KamranMackey references past behavior of iOS beta releases to support their claim that the current beta is likely the GM. This shows an understanding of the subject matter and an attempt to use historical patterns as evidence. However, as D4R1U5 points out, this is not a substitute for an official source.

3. **Relevance of Arguments**: The arguments presented are relevant to the discussion at hand. Both users are focused on whether it is appropriate to consider the beta as the final version and include it in the article.

4. **Coherence**: The discussion is coherent, with each user responding directly to the points raised by the other. The conversation flows logically from one point to the next.

5. **Factual Accuracy**: The debate centers around the interpretation of facts (the version strings of iOS betas) and the application of Wikipedia policies. While KamranMackey's claims about the version strings are factually based, the conclusion drawn from them is not confirmed by an official source, which is a key requirement for Wikipedia.

6. **Rhetorical Strategies**: Both users employ rhetorical strategies to strengthen their positions. User D4R1U5 uses caution and adherence to Wikipedia's strict verification standards as their main argument, while KamranMackey uses their experience and pattern recognition to argue their point. However, experience and pattern recognition do not override the need for verifiable sources.

7. **Respect and Civility**: The discussion remains civil and respectful throughout, with both users presenting their arguments without resorting to personal attacks or inflammatory language.

Considering these points, the average quality of arguments in this discussion is high. Both users show a good understanding of Wikipedia policies and engage in a logical debate. However, the insistence on including information without an official source slightly undermines the overall quality of the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

I would appreciate some uninvolved eyes on Oakland Coliseum station.  has added what I feel is an excessive level of detail about connecting bus routes, and continually reverts me when I remove it.

<user_id=SounderBruce>
The table of bus routes is pretty unnecessary. The best way to convey bus information is to list operators and the general destination of routes in prose, followed by a list of route numbers if necessary. This is the method I've been using for my light rail GAs and lone FA (Tukwila International Boulevard station) and it's worked well. ''''''

<user_id=Titanosaurus>
I think that aesthetically speaking at least, it is much more easier to locate and understand the bus connection information using the table format as seen on good article Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue or even the list format that Pi.1415926535 wants to use than using the written format as seen in your article where the bus connection information is somewhat ""buried"" in there. I would also like to note that the station you linked doesn't even see a quarter of the bus service Oakland Coliseum does, is in a higher-income/lower-density area than Oakland Coliseum that is less transit dependent, and doesn't seem to attract as much bus ridership as Oakland Coliseum does (If I am wrong about the ridership please feel free to correct me with sourced information). '''O'''

<user_id=Titanosaurus>
I think that this would be better discussed with WikiProject Buses, as I have created the bus table on the grounds of AC Transit officially establishing Oakland Coliseum station as one of its transit centers. An important bus station/transit center serving routes that carry over 2.5 million passengers a year (the rail services at the station see about 2.6 million passengers a year in comparison) combined between the station and its surrounding high-density/low-income neighborhoods at that.

<user_id=Morphenniel>
The detailed information on bus routes and connections violates WP:NOT.  Wikipedia is NOT a travel guide, and the fact is that this information is exactly that. I have deleted it.  Any attempt to re-add this information needs to state how it is ""encyclopedic"".  At best it can be re-added with substantial editing to remove superfluous details that are making it a travel guide at the moment. -

<user_id=Titanosaurus>
Can you explain your rationale in detail before you remove what I consider to be a major and informative part of the page that has information seen on many other pages like I just did above even though it seemed to miss you? I would also appreciate it if you linked appropriate and relevant sources to back up your claim. You linked to WP:NOT, except that is a loose arbitrary guideline that doesn't really go into detail about this specific situation, why shouldn't a bus station that is designated as such by several local public transit agencies (as I proved through a source above that you might have overlooked) not have information on the routes that go there? Giving detailed information about a specific place/topic is exactly what an encyclopedia is supposed to do, and what the page currently does. It is also not helpful or informative to simply state that it needs ""substantial"" editing without going into detail about what specific ""editing"" it actually needs to have it meet your rather arbitrarily and loosely enforced ""encyclopedic"" standards. Please do not remove my heavily researched and relevant content without seriously discussing it with me first (WP:DINC, WP:BRD, WP:DRDSTNC, WP:EANOTWC, WP:ETP, WP:DDH), I need to know what the guideline for situations like this is going forward so I can continue to make appropriate and helpful edits to the website in the future. Several other train stations that have a significant public transportation presence (which I yet also linked to above), particularly those in the New York City area, have the same information I put on there, yet everyone seems to be fine with that, so why is this unclear policy being so strictly enforced on Oakland Coliseum all of the sudden? Yes, WP:ATAIDD might lead you to believe that my argument isn't admissible, but that same article says my argument has more credibility to it than your typical ""What about article x?"" argument as I have referred to and linked to a couple of articles which were deemed Good Articles by several editors, including some who belong to this very WikiProject. If you're not interested in seriously discussing this, leave the page alone, and I will bring the issue up with the Reference Desk or another resource. '''O'''

<user_id=Morphenniel>
Wikipedia is very clear on this issue.  We are not a travel guide. Information of that nature can be found on the webpage of the transit agency.  All you are doing is repeating/replicating/duplicating that info on this page.  It will be deleted.  Now that you have prompted, I shall do the same to other articles that you have added this nonsense to. San Rafael Transit Center looks like a good candidate.

Also you have via en edit summary of this diff  admitted to WP:OWN.  To quote you "" ... leave this page alone.""  You are on a slippery slope towards being blocked. -

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Titanosaurus argues for the inclusion of detailed bus route information on the Oakland Coliseum station page, citing that the station is a major transit center and that similar information is present on other Wikipedia pages that are considered good articles. They provide sources to back up their claims about the significance of the bus routes and the station's status as a transit center.

2. User SounderBruce suggests that a table of bus routes is unnecessary and that a more concise method of listing bus operators and general destinations is preferable. They reference their own experience with articles that have achieved good article status.

3. User Morphenniel argues against the inclusion of detailed bus route information, stating that Wikipedia is not a travel guide and that such information is not encyclopedic. They suggest that the information is superfluous and should be substantially edited or removed.

4. User Titanosaurus responds to Morphenniel's argument by questioning the application of the WP:NOT guideline and requesting a detailed rationale for the removal of the content. They also express concern about the consistency of enforcement across similar articles.

5. User Mjroots points out the Wikipedia policy of ""Bold, Revert, Discuss"" (WP:BRD), indicating that after a bold edit is reverted, the next step is to discuss rather than revert again.

6. User Morphenniel reiterates the WP:NOT policy and warns Titanosaurus about the potential consequences of continued reverts and perceived ownership of the article (WP:OWN).

Evaluation of Arguments:

- Titanosaurus provides a well-researched argument with sources and comparisons to other articles, which shows a strong understanding of the subject matter and the context of Wikipedia articles.
- SounderBruce offers a practical alternative based on their experience with similar articles, which is constructive but lacks detailed justification.
- Morphenniel's argument is based on Wikipedia policies, which is relevant and important for maintaining the encyclopedia's standards. However, the argument could benefit from more specific guidance on how to edit the content to fit Wikipedia's standards rather than outright deletion.
- Mjroots succinctly reminds participants of the proper procedure following a revert, which is helpful for maintaining order in the discussion.
- The discussion involves some tension and potential for conflict, particularly with the mention of WP:OWN and the warning of a possible block, which could detract from the collaborative nature of the discussion.

Overall, the discussion includes a mix of well-reasoned arguments with supporting evidence and policy-based arguments that aim to uphold Wikipedia's standards. However, there is also a need for more constructive guidance on how to resolve the issue and a focus on collaboration rather than conflict.

I have currently removed it.  This does not mean I am for or against it, I might be marginally in favour but I'd like to see the arguments for and against.  I think everyone is trying to act in good faith.
I see how discussion is going in a couple of days time
Thankyou.

Adding a few notes:
This article is under WikiProject UK geography (amongst others) with Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography/How to write about settlements#Geography relevant
A list of (current) weather stations here [].  The nearest to Selsey is Bognor.  Guidence seems to be to use Template:Climate chart (however use of Template:Weather box seems quite prevalent.
From a quick glance round the practice for local coastal resorts without a weather stations does appear to be not to published climate tables. Worthing is a similar 'B-Class' article with an approach similar to that for Selsey (without the climate table).
The climate data will usually be available at the next regional level up (usually county), in this case West Sussex, though Hampshire takes a different (possible better) approach showing a spread of results from weather stations.  Interestingly the 'See also' goes to the UK climate article skipping the county section article.
The case for the climate tables are that visitors intending to Holiday to Selsey and checking Wikipedia might be interested in the climate data
I believe the climate table contributor would indicate the data is properly sourced on the basis of the 5km grid data published from the Met Office.  I have only a hazy understanding of how this works but is apparently interpolates between weather stations and is supplemented by other sources and they are fairly confident most spurious readings have been eliminated.

<user_id=Djm-leighpark>
My though is longer term not automated manual maintenance of such climate tables is probably unsustainable.
Overviewing these points I conclude on balance the climate data should not be included for Selsey but I am open to other arguments.

<user_id=Charlesdrakew>
I my experiance consensus is that covering climate is best done at county level. Unless there is an official weather station in the settlement the data is going to be extrapolated and not verifiable in such fine detail. Local factors can not be factored in with certainty. Such a mass of detail is probably undue for an encyclopedia article on a settlement. If we use anything I would favour the climate chart because it conveys sufficient information for the average reader in an easily digestible form.
There is also the question of original research as the data is copied from a primary source database, and one that requires login.
As to informing visitors Wikipedia is not a travel guide. We have Wikivoyage for that function, and that can be linked to. In this country the weather we actually get has little relation to averages anyway.

<user_id=Wilfridselsey>
The main climate points about Selsey is that it is in the sunniest part of the UK and  in a tornado hotspot ('The Isle of Wight and South Coast Anomaly'), the article now provides that information. The citations include links to quite comprehensive Met office  climate tables for Selsey. The weather detail on the West Sussex page is quite limited, hence the See Also to the UK Climate page.  I think the section now works with or without the climate tables. But as you say, the problem with climate tables is that they have to be manually updated.

<user_id=SovalValtos>
The current version without a weather box seems to be going in the right direction by using text and cited sources. One advantage of Wikipedia is the ease of linking information. Just because the Met Office do a synthesis of data does not mean we need to use it in all settlements a few miles apart giving it undue weight. Wikilink(s) to the appropriate regional level or nearest weather station site article would hit the mark. Introducing material with an unsustainable maintenance requirement does not seem a good idea. Incidently would it not be better to have the climate content as part of a Geography section?

<user_id=10 December 2017>
I am open to having a discussion about the weather box. What I do not agree is that the weather box must not be included until we reach a consensus. I added the data back in the Autumn and added the record highs and lows in the following months, until recently all of that data has gone unchallenged. Soon as the weather box was there before this dispute had begun, then arguably it should remain in place until we reach a consensus. The primary reason I added the weather box was because Selsey is located in the sunniest grid square of the UK according to the Met Office. So because of this, a climate chart will not do as it does not display the sunshine hours. Selsey does not have significantly different weather to most other parts of the UK with the exception of its sunshine totals.

<user_id=10 December 2017>
I also do not agree that weather boxes bear little resemblance to the actual weather conditions. Most likely this is used as a cover up to claim things like there are ''more sunny days in the winter'' or ''the south coast of England is not sunny in the summer'', both of which are undisputedly false.

<user_id=Djm-leighpark>
Given content arguments so far I'd recommend removal of weather box and move climate section to subsection of geography.  I am personnally not undoing that last edit (821130566) at the moment to avoid warring.

<user_id=Djm-leighpark>
I am beginning to think concensus is unlikely to be reached.  And there have been no updates in 24 hour to that revert re-inserting climate data with a weatherbox the which is not in my opinion consistent with WikiProject UK geography/How to write about settlements#Geography.   Unless someone feels confident to back the weatherbox out we will need to go to Wikipedia:Dispute resolution / WP:Wikipedia:Dispute resolution requests which gives a number of directions and I would appreciate comments on which way to go.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. <user_id=Djm-leighpark> initiates the discussion by acknowledging the need for consensus on the inclusion of climate data in the Selsey article. They provide a balanced view, stating they are marginally in favor but open to arguments. They also mention the relevance of WikiProject UK geography guidelines and the practice of other similar articles, which shows an understanding of Wikipedia's standards and practices.

2. <user_id=Charlesdrakew> argues against the inclusion of detailed climate data for settlements without an official weather station, citing concerns about verifiability and the undue weight of such detailed information in an encyclopedia article. They also raise the issue of original research and suggest that Wikipedia is not a travel guide, which is a valid point considering Wikipedia's purpose.

3. <user_id=Wilfridselsey> points out the unique climate features of Selsey and suggests that the article already provides this information without the need for detailed climate tables. They acknowledge the maintenance issue with climate tables, showing an understanding of the practical aspects of Wikipedia editing.

4. <user_id=SovalValtos> supports the current version without a weather box, emphasizing the ease of linking to more detailed information and the importance of not giving undue weight to synthesized data. They also mention the sustainability of content maintenance, which is a practical consideration for the Wikipedia community.

5. <user_id=10 December 2017> argues for the inclusion of the weather box, stating that it was unchallenged for a period and that Selsey's unique sunshine hours are not adequately represented by a climate chart. They also refute the claim that weather boxes do not reflect actual conditions, although this argument is more subjective and less grounded in Wikipedia's guidelines.

6. <user_id=Djm-leighpark> summarizes the arguments and recommends the removal of the weather box based on the discussion and WikiProject guidelines. They also suggest moving the climate section to a subsection of geography, which aligns with the structure recommended by the guidelines.

7. <user_id=Djm-leighpark> expresses doubt about reaching a consensus and outlines the next steps for dispute resolution according to Wikipedia's policies, showing a commitment to following proper procedures.

Overall, the discussion is characterized by a focus on Wikipedia's guidelines, the practicality of content maintenance, and the purpose of Wikipedia as an encyclopedia rather than a travel guide. The arguments are generally well-reasoned, with references to policies and practices, and there is a clear effort to reach a consensus through discussion rather than edit warring.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.",8.0
"<user_id=Traal>
Parking shortage

<user_id=Traal>
The article states, ""Lack of parking is a major problem in the Hillcrest area."" But one could also truthfully state that underpriced parking rates are the problem, because a shortage occurs ""when the price of an item is set below the equilibrium rate determined by supply and demand.""

<user_id=Traal>
So then the question becomes, how is the difficulty of finding a convenient parking space a problem? Does it hurt the economy? Does it create traffic congestion? Does it inconvenience motorists? The article doesn't say.

<user_id=Traal>
On the other hand, the economically optimal number of parking spaces is the number where the cost of building another one equals the revenue from building it. The article admits that the retailers could not justify the cost of a parking garage; therefore, MR

<user_id=MelanieN>
So I gather you don't dispute that there is a parking shortage; you just dispute that the parking shortage is a problem. Am I understanding you correctly? If so, we could change the first sentence to read ""there is a shortage of parking in the Hillcrest area,"" which I don't think anyone would dispute.

<user_id=Traal>
Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are parking lots and garages in Hillcrest that always seem to have spaces available, so ""shortage"" may not be the right word. How about ""visitors often have trouble finding parking in the Hillcrest area""?

<user_id=MelanieN>
I think we need to go with what Reliable Sources say, rather than with our interpretation of anecdotal evidence or our analysis of the economics of parking spaces. My impression is that ""parking shortage"" is the common phrase in Reliable Source articles about the area. Let's evaluate that, shall we?  BTW thank you for calling my attention to this article; I've been neglecting it. It was seriously out of date with regard to the Uptown Partnership/Uptown Community Parking District; I have now updated it as well as improving the way some of the references were cited.

<user_id=MelanieN>
OK, here is the relevant information from the three most relevant sources in the article.

<user_id=MelanieN>
The ''Uptown News'' article says ""District Three Councilmember Todd Gloria recently said at a press conference one of the biggest complaints he gets from the community is about parking.""
The UT ""Partnership blasted over parking"" article cites a ""worsening parking situation,"" as well as the projected ""shortage"" numbers, which you disputed.
The UT ""Parking in Hillcrest?"" article says the area is ""perpetually short of parking.""

<user_id=Traal>
I don't doubt that Gloria would get a lot of complaints about parking. So maybe something like, ""One of the biggest complaints voiced by the Hillcrest community is about parking.""

<user_id=MelanieN>
Let's back up. The article's current statement is ""Lack of parking is a major problem in the Hillcrest area"". That it is a problem seems to be pretty well supported by all the shouting and complaining about it, as well as the creation of quasi-governmental agencies tasked with creating more parking. But you tagged it as ""dubious"". I thought you were objecting to the word ""problem"", which could be considered POV. So I suggested ""There is a shortage of parking in the HIllcrest area."" That there is a shortage seems to be well supported by Reliable Sources, as cited above (two of the three sources actually used the word ""short"" or ""shortage""). But now you seem to be objecting to the word ""shortage"", despite its repeated use by Reliable Sources. I don't understand why you are so determined to dance around the subject rather than making a simple statement of (what appears to be) fact. Is your objection that you don't think there is an actual shortage (based on an anecdotal comment by an anonymous person in a discussion thread on a blog where everyone else is saying that there IS a shortage), or that there is a shortage but it isn't a problem, or what? Let me understand what it is about this sentence that you are trying to fix.

<user_id=Traal>
Because Uptown Partnership voted against building a parking garage, evidently they felt that there's no lack of parking or that it isn't enough of a problem to justify adding more parking. However, the complaints about parking show that parking is a concern, so ""parking is a major concern in the Hillcrest area"" would be a true statement supported by the cited sources.

<user_id=MelanieN>
I guess I could go with that wording. I'll add it and delete the ""dubious"" tag. But just for the record, the Uptown Partnership felt no such thing. That interpretation is dead wrong. Their whole purpose in life, the reason the parking district was created, was to improve the parking situation (hence the name). After they realized they couldn't afford a parking garage, they turned their attention to trying to find additional on-street parking. And the reason the Uptown Partnership finally lost public favor and got dissolved was their failure to create more parking.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Traal begins by challenging the notion that a parking shortage is inherently a problem, suggesting that the real issue might be underpriced parking rates. This introduces an economic perspective on supply and demand, which is a valid point to consider in such discussions.

2. User Traal then questions how the difficulty of finding parking is a problem, asking for clarification on whether it affects the economy, causes traffic congestion, or inconveniences motorists. This is a reasonable request for specificity in the article.

3. User Traal further argues that the economically optimal number of parking spaces is not being met, referencing the retailers' decision against building a parking garage. This argument is based on economic principles and is relevant to the discussion.

4. User MelanieN responds by trying to clarify Traal's position and suggests a revision to the sentence in question. MelanieN is focused on accurately representing the situation without making unsupported claims.

5. User Traal provides anecdotal evidence to suggest that ""shortage"" may not be the correct term, proposing a rephrasing that reflects the difficulty of finding parking rather than an absolute shortage. This is a constructive suggestion, though it relies on anecdotal evidence rather than verified sources.

6. User MelanieN emphasizes the importance of relying on Reliable Sources rather than personal interpretation or anecdotal evidence. This is a key point in maintaining the integrity and verifiability of Wikipedia content.

7. User MelanieN then provides excerpts from Reliable Sources that support the use of the term ""shortage"" and the notion that parking is a problem in the area. This strengthens the argument for using the term ""shortage"" in the article.

8. User Traal acknowledges the complaints about parking but suggests a different phrasing that focuses on parking as a ""major concern"" rather than a shortage. This is a compromise that still addresses the issue without implying a shortage that Traal is not convinced exists.

9. User MelanieN agrees to the new wording but clarifies the role and intentions of the Uptown Partnership, countering Traal's interpretation of their actions. This adds context and corrects a potential misunderstanding about the situation.

Overall, the discussion is characterized by a back-and-forth exchange where both users present their viewpoints, provide evidence, and make suggestions for revisions. The arguments are generally well-reasoned, relevant, and focused on improving the accuracy and neutrality of the article. Both users show a willingness to consider alternative perspectives and reach a consensus.

Can you just stop reveting an edit, that is clearly not vandalism, with the summary ""removing vandalism"". I remind you that this article is not your property WP:OWN, and that you have to address other people respectfully and not slander them with false accusation of vandalism. We're not in a Mou9ata3a here ;) OK?

<user_id=Tabrisius>
YOU should stop editing with unsourced and vandal ways...Moroccan Armed Forces had been deployed in all those conflicts and there are sources posted in the article. Next time you edit i'll contact somebody to make you respect a bit others work...There are no UN missions in conflicts...SFOR, KFOR and UNITAF aren't UN missions but NATO missions, Morocco stayed in Zaire till 1979, and YES malian and mauretanian sources confirmed moroccan Special forces in MAli (See sources) So STOP editing and go read a bit about moroccan involvement in recent conflicts...

<user_id=Yabroq>
First you are in WP:3RR violation. Where are these sources? I think you should learn a thing or two about Wikipedia. This isn't your personal blog & review the way you address others on here.

<user_id=Yabroq>
Re content, 1) provide reliable sources for your claims (i.e. military involvement in Northern Mali conflict, or the Huthi conflict in Yemen which is just alleged. 2) Peace-keeping missions (whether UN or not) are not combat missions and therefore should not clog the infobox in place of other major conflicts. 3) The Moroccan Gendarmerie was only involved in Shaba I, remains to be proven that they did participate in Shaba II.

<user_id=Yabroq>
BTW whats this? a threat? ""'''Next time you edit i'll contact somebody to make you respect a bit others work'''"" We're on Wikipedia remember?

<user_id=Tabrisius>
Are you Kiddin me?? you don't see the sources posted, are you really kiddin me?? YOUR ARE TROLLING ME?? Shaba II  , Northern Mali conflict , , ,  Operation Scorched Earth , '''READ MORE ABOUT''' Unified Task Force, SFOR and KFOR... Saying that UNITAF, SFOR and KFOR werent combat conflicts is an insult to all those who died in Serbia, Kosovo and Somalia under enemy fire. '''IF THERE ARE SOURCE ABOUT AND ARE ACCEPTED SO YOU SHOULD STOP BECAUSE ITS VANDALISM'''... '''so stop your trolling and vandalism EDITING and ERASING INFORMATION FORM MULTIPLE SOURCES (so the 3RR rule apply TO YOU not to me)''' If you want mor sources I can give you more...but stop trolling and editing as a Vandal reliable sources and verified information.

<user_id=Yabroq>
I think you need to calm down. Shouting and down-talking won't help persuade anybody, least me. Please read WP:RS and WP:Cite. According to the very LSE document you just linked, Morocco was not involved in Shaba II. The subsequent African peace-keeping force that was sent there IS NOT Shaba II. The alleged involvement in Operation Serval, is at best speculation and not supported by any reliable sources. (Sorry self published news sites such as maliactu.com/malijet.com aren't reliable sources). Again I reiterate that peace keeping missions (which are not battles, exception made for Mogadishu) do not belong to the infobox which should only include major military combat ops. Finally, you've thrown at me quite a few personal attacks and a threat, please take a look at WP:PA and WP:CIVIL

<user_id=Tabrisius>
¿me calming down? stop acting as a troll and stop acting as a victim...and read a bit the sources ¿selfpublished sources? they are newsites and one even have a radio chanel!!! Jeuneafrique a self-published source???really?? who you are trying to convince??? Who the hell you think you are to say that a source is not valid, not one, but three differents and that have nothing to dou with Morocco or Moroccan Army or even are pro-moroccan??? you think that posting some rules will change something when you don't even know how all them work??? I've been creating, editing and publishing in wikipedia for years, don't tell me how to contribute...Shaba II was in 1978 LIKE IT IS WROTE IN THE SOURCES THAT THE MOROCCAN ARMY WAS FIGHITING IN ZAIRE WITH LUBARIS!!! WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY DOING THERE? WERE THERE ANY OTHER CONFLICTS IN ZAIRE IN 1978??? ARE WE ALL IDIOTS OR WHAT??? Stop trolling, stop acting as a vandal...you want me to put the conflicts instead of the missions? Ok...you'll have your conflicts. BW...Wich personal atacks?

''About your Third Opinion request:''' I am a regular volunteer at the Third Opinion Project. The request for a Third Opinion in reference to this dispute has been removed because this dispute does not meet the requirement of the Third Opinion project that, ""Before making a request here, be sure that the issue has been thoroughly discussed on the article talk page. 3O is only for assistance in resolving disagreements that have come to a standstill."" All moderated content dispute resolution processes at Wikipedia require extensive talk page discussion before requesting assistance. If one removes the shouting and name calling which has occurred so far in this discussion, there has been very little ''real'' discussion of the issues here and even less on-topic back and forth. For example, Tachfin has asserted that, ""self published news sites such as maliactu.com/malijet.com aren't reliable sources"". Discussion on that point would proceed by discussing what defines a reliable source and what defines a self published source and then examining whether the named sources meet those definitions. If help is needed to work out uncertainties, you could then ask a question at the reliable sources noticeboard. That kind of thing is clearly not what has happened here. Regards,

<user_id=Yabroq>
Thanks TransporterMan for your feedback. , I reiterate my request to you to: refrain from personal attacks, keep the discussion WP:Civil and WP:AGF. No, you do not WP:OWN this article. Trust me you're not doing yourself any favours by behaving like above.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Yabroq is requesting that User Tabrisius stop reverting edits and accuses them of falsely labeling edits as vandalism. Yabroq invokes Wikipedia's policy on ownership of articles (WP:OWN) and calls for respectful dialogue.

2. User Tabrisius responds with a strong defense of their actions, asserting that the Moroccan Armed Forces' involvement in various conflicts is sourced in the article. They accuse Yabroq of vandalism for removing sourced information.

3. User Yabroq counters by asking for reliable sources and suggests that peacekeeping missions should not be conflated with combat missions in the infobox. They also point out that certain claims about military involvement are speculative and not supported by reliable sources.

4. User Tabrisius continues to assert the validity of their sources and accuses Yabroq of trolling and vandalism. They also express frustration and use capital letters for emphasis, which can be interpreted as shouting.

5. User Yabroq maintains a more composed tone, reiterating the need for reliable sources and adherence to Wikipedia's guidelines on civility and personal attacks.

6. User TransporterMan, a third-party volunteer, steps in to explain that the dispute does not meet the criteria for a Third Opinion request due to insufficient discussion on the article's talk page. They suggest a more structured approach to resolving the dispute, focusing on the definitions of reliable and self-published sources.

Evaluation of Argument Quality:

- User Yabroq presents their arguments by referencing Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, asking for reliable sources, and maintaining a focus on the content dispute. They also call for civility and adherence to Wikipedia's behavioral guidelines.

- User Tabrisius defends their position by asserting the presence of sources but does so with a confrontational tone, including accusations of trolling and vandalism. They also use capital letters, which can be perceived as shouting and may detract from the quality of the argument.

- User TransporterMan provides a neutral perspective, focusing on the process and suggesting constructive ways to resolve the dispute.

Overall, the quality of the discussion is hindered by the confrontational tone and lack of structured argumentation from User Tabrisius. User Yabroq, while more composed, could engage in more in-depth discussion on the talk page as suggested by TransporterMan. The intervention by TransporterMan adds value to the discussion by guiding the users towards a more productive resolution process.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 4.5",4.5
"<user_id=Bakaso>
NPOV

<user_id=Bakaso>
I added the NPOV template, because the article was written exactly be the people whose ideology is derived from teachings of the Frankfurt school. They also used only their own obscure and extremist sources, for example by the SPLC, which is an anti-white Jewish hate group.

<user_id=Coffeepusher>
I am removing the NPOV tag because you are not proposing any actionable items.  Where is the article lacking in ""representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic?"" Simply stating that the article is written using reliable sources you don't like isn't enough, what sources need to be incorporated?

<user_id=Bakaso>
It's not that I don't like the sources, I don't like the authors who wrote them, because they're the ones who created this claim about a ""conspiracy theory"". This article is NPOV, because it doesn't say it was created by them and instead presents it as a real conspiracy theory, where most people agree on the fact that it's implausible. This is a clever ruse on the part of the neo-marxists and an attempt to deny the fact that their teachings indeed originate in the Frankfurt school.

<user_id=Coffeepusher>
please read wikipedia's sourcing policy, WP:FRINGE, and wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.  The tag is inappropriate, because you are not complaining that the sourcing is wrong, or proposing additional reliable sources.  Not liking the page, or agreeing with the view is not enough on wikipedia, and the WP:NPOV tag is inappropriate if you aren't going to actually engage with the npov policy, which is directly about sourcing.

<user_id=Bakaso>
No, it's about the way the sources are cited. The Wikipedians want to make people think that this is a fact, so they cite extremist literature without properly ascribing the sources to the authors. For example the one I corrected: nowhere did it say that Martin Jay is in fact a prominent neo-marxist and a critical theory expert. Wikipedia requires this, because else anyone could create a completely false article based on fringe extremist literature. So it's you who should read up about Wikipedia's sourcing policy and fringe sources.

<user_id=Coffeepusher>
so it's you who should read up about Wikipedia's sourcing policy and fringe sources I've asked you a few times to cite the sources you have a problem with, so what are they?

<user_id=Coffeepusher>
and you are correct that this is documenting a WP:FRINGE view, please read WP:NFRINGE and the article for deletion page for this article.

<user_id=Bakaso>
I have a problem with almost every source in the article, because as I said, they're improperly cited. There should be such phrases like ""according to proponents of this theory"", ""according to a neo-marxist professor X"" etc.

<user_id=Coffeepusher>
they are cited according to the WP:MOS.  Giving bibliographical information within the text of sourcing is not in accordance to wikipedia's policy, and you are only required to name the author of the reference if you are giving a full sentence quote, and no biblographical information is required.  Additionally, according to reliable sources there exists a conspiracy theory that is documented in this paper.  It hasn't been manufactured by anyone, it exists and is documented in reliable peer reviewed sources.  Since your issue is that the citations do not have the bibliographical information of the source authors, and this is not in violation of wikipedia's manual of style or NPOV policy, I am removing the NPOV tag again unless you can give me a wikipedia policy that says the article is incorrectly cited.

<user_id=Coffeepusher>
Now we can continue discussing if more bibliographical information is appropriate, but that isn't a NPOV issue, so replacing the tag is inappropriate.

<user_id=Bakaso>
You're trying to pretend you don't understand my comments, but seeing you're a communist and a neo-marxist yourself, this tactic is perhaps understandable. WP:NPOV clearly says: Avoid stating opinions as facts. Which is what's happening in this article, the claims in the sources are passed off as facts.

<user_id=Bakaso>
'""Usually, articles will contain information about the significant opinions that have been expressed about their subjects. However, these opinions should not be stated in Wikipedia's voice. Rather, they should be attributed in the text to particular sources, or where justified, described as widespread views, etc. For example, an article should not state that ""genocide is an evil action"", but it may state that ""genocide has been described by John X as the epitome of human evil.""''

<user_id=Coffeepusher>
What extremist sources are you referring to?  Every source on this page passes WP:RS, is written in the voice of those sources, and fuflills weight.

<user_id=190.141.142.209>
SPLC has been described by some as extremist. And it's written in the voice of the sources without stating so, which is the problem. For example the lead should read: Frankfurt School conspiracy theory is an alleged conspiracy theory, which according to some left-wing activists originated with a 1992 essay in a Lyndon LaRouche movement journal.

<user_id=Coffeepusher>
SPLC is a reliable source for wikipedia, and while ""some"" may consider it extremist, wikipedia considers it reliable.  Do you have any sources within this text that would be considered unreliable and extremist by wikipedia's standards since that is what you need to prove to maintain the NPOV tag.

<user_id=Coffeepusher>
This discussion has been mentioned at WP:ANI#new user at Frankfurt School conspiracy theory, as well as the WP:RSN#Frankfurt School conspiracy theory ""extremest sources"".

<user_id=JzG>
Given the rather obvious lack of any widespread acceptance of the idea that this is an NPOV issue, I removed the template. WP:BRD applied. The ""D"" part has conspicuously failed to support the ""B"" part, so the ""R"" part wins...  ()

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Bakaso raises concerns about the neutrality of an article, claiming that it is written by people with a specific ideological bias and uses sources from what they consider extremist groups. They argue that the article does not properly attribute the views to the authors and presents them as facts.

2. User Coffeepusher responds by asking for specific actionable items and references to Wikipedia's policies on sourcing and neutrality. They point out that simply not liking the sources or the views they represent is not sufficient to tag an article as non-neutral.

3. User Bakaso insists that the issue is with the way sources are cited, suggesting that the article should include phrases like ""according to proponents of this theory"" to clarify that the views are not universally accepted facts.

4. User Coffeepusher counters by explaining that the citations are in line with Wikipedia's Manual of Style and that the article is documenting a conspiracy theory that exists and is supported by reliable, peer-reviewed sources. They also clarify that bibliographical information about the authors of the sources is not required unless a direct quote is used.

5. User Bakaso accuses Coffeepusher of not understanding their comments and being ideologically biased themselves. They reiterate that the article presents opinions as facts, which is against Wikipedia's neutrality policy.

6. User Coffeepusher asks for specific examples of extremist sources that do not meet Wikipedia's reliability standards, emphasizing that the burden of proof is on Bakaso to demonstrate that the sources are unreliable by Wikipedia's criteria.

7. User JzG steps in to remove the neutrality tag, citing the lack of widespread support for Bakaso's claim and the failure to substantiate the initial bold edit with evidence.

Evaluation:

- User Bakaso's arguments are based on their personal views of the sources and authors, rather than on Wikipedia's policies or guidelines. They fail to provide specific examples of unreliable sources or to suggest alternative reliable sources that could be used to balance the article.

- User Coffeepusher's arguments are grounded in Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, specifically referencing the Manual of Style, the policy on fringe theories, and the neutral point of view policy. They consistently ask for evidence to support Bakaso's claims and explain the proper citation practices on Wikipedia.

- User JzG's intervention is brief but is based on the consensus-building process on Wikipedia, where the lack of evidence to support a bold edit means that the status quo (the removal of the neutrality tag) should be maintained.

Overall, the discussion quality is mixed. While User Coffeepusher provides clear, policy-based arguments and requests for evidence, User Bakaso's arguments are less coherent and lack substantiation. The discussion is somewhat circular, with Bakaso repeating the same claims without providing the requested evidence. However, the engagement with Wikipedia's policies and the attempt to resolve the dispute through dialogue is a positive aspect of the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Mentions of Liataud and big game hunting

<user_id=Mendaliv>
I question the relevance of discussing Liataud and his taste for big game hunting in this article. While there is, evidently, at least one case where people have called for a boycott of the restaurant in response to Liataud's conduct, I don't think it's sufficiently relevant to the company itself to merit inclusion. Furthermore, even if it were relevant, I would argue that any mention would need to be fairly minimal to comply with WP:UNDUE. It's just not that significant an event in the overall history of the restaurant to merit the level of inclusion that has been sought. While controversy and criticism sections can be very helpful in balancing out an article—particularly in this case, where the article has pretty clearly been astroturfed in the past—the controversy and criticism discussed needs to be balanced in its relevance to the overall subject. —////

Liataud's ""taste for big game hunting"" has been very widely covered in the media, including an article in the Wall Street Journal specifically regarding calls for boycotts. Obviously a newsworthy event that only someone with an interest in protecting the image of the company would be opposed to being brought to light. Taquim

Cute. I've been keeping corporate shilling off this article for over a year already, but because I challenge your mentioning of some tangential story about the company's founder in an excessively prominent manner, ''I'm'' a paid editor. —////

<user_id=Taquim>
Hmmmm... for the past year this article has been marked as unbalanced because ""A major contributor to this article appears to have a close connection with its subject."" When that warning is removed from this article I'll be convinced that you are not working for Jimmy John's with your main task being the prevention of negative publicity. Taquim

<user_id=Ian.thomson>
Read WP:AGF, which you have just grossly failed to comply with.  Seriously, do not make those kinds of accusations against Mendaliv again without some damn good evidence or I will treat it as a personal attack against him.
To you and the IP editor: I saw no discussion from anyone while the article was protected, and when protection expired, both of you started back up.  Discuss matters here based on policy.  Not just bringing up the possibility of shills, or saying ""the community disagrees,"" but citing actual policies that demonstrate that the material does or does not belong.

<user_id=Taquim>
Ok, thanks for the tip Ian, I have thoroughly read the AGF article. I would love to discuss this controversy. The call for a boycott against Jimmy John's due to big game hunting practiced by the founder was widely covered by major news outlets including the Wall Street Journal. Although the calls for a boycott were initiated based on the actions of the founder, the implications of a boycott obviously extend to the company in general, thus making this an appropriate entry for the history section of this article. Wikipedia has indicated that this article is unbalanced because ""A major contributor to this article appears to have a close connection with its subject."" One step towards addressing and rectifying this imbalance would be to include a mention of the hunting controversy with a link to the Wall Street Journal article.Taquim

<user_id=Mendaliv>
If there's enough coverage out there that this was a significant event in the company's history, then there might be grounds under WP:DUE to include a mention. I haven't seen an adequate demonstration that such coverage exists. Moreover, I would argue that the coverage ''at most'' would probably represent a sentence. Much more significant is the labor dispute problem, for example. —////

<user_id=Taquim>
Adequate coverage: please Google: ""Jimmy John's controversy"" and you will see that the top results are concerning big game hunting. I'm still not sure why we are hesitant to include information that was covered not in some fringe website but but in most major news outlets. Please remember that according to Wikipedia this article is currently unbalanced due to contributions from editors with close connections to the subject. It seems that a logical way to address this lack of balance would be to not shy away from including information that was very widely covered in the mainstream press. I'm fine with compromise; please rewrite my addition to this article and condense it into one sentence and publish it, thus precluding the necessity of mediation. Taquim

<user_id=185.54.163.224>
I apologize for not taking the issue of the boycott to the Talk page immediately. I have never before been involved in what seems to have turned into an editing war, and I thought that the issue of the boycott was so inappropriate that I just deleted it. It seemed almost like vandalism to me. I also did not realize that the point of the three-day moratorium on edits was to give editors time to discuss the issue on the Talk page. Something like a ceasefire during negotiations. Wikipedia editing is certainly a learning process.

<user_id=185.54.163.224>
Now that I understand the mechanism involved when editors disagree about what should or should not be in an article, I would like to present well-substantiated arguments as to why a mention of the boycott is inappropriate in this article.

<user_id=185.54.163.224>
Basically all the reasons have already been stated, so I am just re-iterating. First of all, there is WP:Coatrack, already mentioned by . The article is about Jimmy John’s, and not about the company’s founder. In addition, the call for a boycott was an isolated event of very few people, which quickly passed from the public consciousness, further making it irrelevant, which  pointed out.  In addition, since the issue was so minor, giving it more prominence in the Wikipedia article begins to violate WP:DUE, which strives to keep articles balanced to achieve WP:NPOV. Having an entire section dedicated to this issue tips the balance we are trying to achieve for this article, making it look like the boycott is important, widespread, and even relevant, which it is not, as stated already above. In order to keep this article balanced I believe the discussion of the boycott, should be kept out of the article.

<user_id=Taquim>
I'd like to propose that we address the most serious issue regarding the Jimmy John's Wikipedia entry: according to the Wikipedia banner at the top of the article, the article needs cleanup because ""A major contributor to this article appears to have a close connection with its subject."" The banner indicates that this has resulted in problems with the balance and neutrality of the article. Why then, one might wonder would there be such fierce opposition to an entry in the article that attempts to address this imbalance as one step toward the removal of the Wikipedia warning banner? Claims of coatracking: Revelations of big game hunting by the founder and potential implications of a boycott were deemed by the Wall Street Journal and many other major news outlets to be worthy of coverage. This was a major news event, not a tangential one. Although it was the actions of the company owner that brought the media spotlight, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out, there were potential implications for the company in general. The IP address commenter above indicates concerns with Due and Undue Weight, but the Wikipedia entry defining that concept states that ""Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources..."" which seems to indicate that the boycott should be mentioned and referenced to the Wall Street Journal and other articles. IP address commenter above states that ""In order to keep this article balanced....""  However, this article currently has a Wikipedia banner at the top stating that the article is not balanced, meaning that ""keeping"" this article balanced would not be possible. I feel that this issue needs mediation but unfortunately Mendaliv has declined my invitation to mediation. Mendaliv has however (see above) suggested that a sentence referring to the boycott might be appropriate. I appreciate this gesture and I find this to be a reasonable compromise. Is anyone opposed to a one sentence mention of the boycott in the article with the Wall Street Journal article as citation? If there is not agreement, could we please take this to mediation rather than engage in editing wars? Taquim

<user_id=Taquim>
Is anyone opposed to adding the following sentence under the heading ""Calls for Boycott"" ?
In the summer of 2015, pictures of Jimmy John Liautaud, (founder and owner of Jimmy John's Sandwiches) posing next to the dead bodies of elephants, rhinos, and other exotic animals began to appear on social media along with calls to boycott Jimmy John's restaurants.   Taquim

<user_id=Mendaliv>
''Oppose''': Too long, not significant enough of an event to merit an entire subsection. Probably doesn't merit mentioning at all given there doesn't seem to be an ongoing connection to the restaurants rather than to Liataud himself. —////

<user_id=Taquim>
Ok, rather than subsection, how about an entry in the main History section, where it would chronologically be the last entry. The connection to the restaurant is that the threat of a boycott that would impact the chain and its investors was real enough that it was covered (as cited) in the WSJ and many other news outlets. Here is a shortened version: In the summer of 2015, pictures of Liautaud, posing next to the dead bodies of elephants, rhinos, and other exotic animals began to appear on social media along with calls to boycott Jimmy John's restaurants.   Taquim

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Relevance of the Topic: The main point of contention is whether the actions of Jimmy John's founder, specifically his big game hunting, and the subsequent calls for a boycott, are relevant to the company's Wikipedia article. User Taquim argues that it is relevant due to media coverage and potential impact on the company, while user Mendaliv questions its significance to the company's history and relevance to the article.

2. Policy Citations: Both parties cite Wikipedia policies to support their arguments. Mendaliv refers to WP:UNDUE, which suggests that undue weight should not be given to minor aspects of a subject, while Taquim points to WP:DUE and WP:NPOV, which call for a neutral point of view and representation of significant viewpoints published by reliable sources.

3. Media Coverage: Taquim emphasizes that the big game hunting controversy was covered by major news outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, suggesting that it is a significant event. Mendaliv requests evidence of the coverage's significance to the company's history.

4. Accusations and Civility: There are accusations of potential bias and conflict of interest, with Taquim suggesting that Mendaliv might have a close connection to the subject. User Ian.thomson intervenes, reminding Taquim to adhere to WP:AGF (Assume Good Faith) and not to make such accusations without evidence.

5. Compromise and Resolution: Taquim proposes a compromise by suggesting a one-sentence mention of the boycott in the article, which Mendaliv still opposes, stating that it is not significant enough to merit inclusion.

6. Discussion Conduct: The discussion involves back-and-forth arguments, with both users presenting their points and counterpoints. There is an attempt at reaching a compromise, and the discussion remains focused on the topic without devolving into personal attacks after the warning from Ian.thomson.

Overall, the discussion is conducted with a reasonable level of civility, and both parties make efforts to support their arguments with Wikipedia policies and references to media coverage. The discussion could be improved by providing more concrete evidence of the boycott's impact on the company and by focusing on finding a middle ground that satisfies Wikipedia's guidelines for inclusion. The quality of the arguments is average, with both sides presenting valid points but also showing some resistance to compromise.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=124.171.32.15>
Off-topic

<user_id=124.171.32.15>
This section seems off-topic from the overall article. It may be more suited to an article on occupational sexism, not airconditioning (i.e. Occupational sexism).

<user_id=Udoks>
I believe hiding it away would be denying the impact and trying to sweep such issues under the rug so to speak. This is a real issues impacting the lives of real women just as much as the proclaimed health impacts this impacts the mental health of women in the workplace. It's my case that this is highly relevant to Wikipedia.

<user_id=Deli nk>
It's definitely not appropriate for this article.  I agree it's off topic.  The content is also based on low-quality sources with click-baity titles.

<user_id=Udoks>
According to wikipedia's own allowance and their use in other sources they are more than reputable and in now way Click-Baitey titles. They are legitimate Wikipedia sources and such sites have been cited in a number of other articles including one recently cleared by Arbcom

<user_id=Deli nk>
Nonsense, Arbcom does not clear sources or articles.

<user_id=Andy Dingley>
Why is an aspect very clearly focussed on aircon ""inappropriate"" here?  It is very well sourced, despite the doubly inaccurate ""Completely based on the musings of one columnist in the Telegraph (not a reliable source on the subject)"" claim. As to occupational sexism, then there is no reason why content can't appear in multiple locations.

<user_id=Deli nk>
The claims that ""air conditioning plays a large role in the inherent sexism and oppression of women in the workplace"" and ""overuse of airconditioning in offices is purely to benefit men"" are ridiculous.  They are blatant exaggerations of what the crappy ''Washington Post'' and ''Telegraph'' articles say, and those two articles are themselves exaggerations of the primary source in ''Nature'' that only talks about ""miscalculating metabolic rate on female thermal demand"".  The whole thing is an unseemly inappropriate made-up controversy.

<user_id=Andy Dingley>
So re-write it in a more neutral fashion. But we have four sources making much the same point, one primary and three commenting upon it.  Your ""crappy"" judgement is entirely OR. It is no reason to blank a whole section, just because you disagree with some conclusions drawn from it.

<user_id=VQuakr>
This is completely off topic and sensationalistic as written. The linked general interest articles are about office temperature '''setpoints'''; whether the air is conditioned or naturally ventilated is not particularly relevant. Somehow that is being extrapolated into ""air conditioning is inherently sexist."" Devoting an ''entire freaking section'' to this stupid clickbait is moronic; a ''sentence'' somewhere summarizing the ASHRAE and Nature standards for the disparate comfort ranges for men and women would be appropriate as that appears to have been missing.

<user_id=Udoks>
Stupid Blickbait and moronic nonsense. I'm shocked you so flippantly dismiss the oppression of women by such systems and diminish those shedding light on such injustices like this. All the articles mentioned Air conditioning in some capacity and hiding the inherent sexism of this is just furthering peoples oppression. I posted on the talk page for this article over a week before I made edits. No-one cared then but suddenly it's like I've hit a nest of MRAs wanting to hide this information. How strange that suddenly so many people care about something others have already stated could be equally applicable here.

<user_id=Udoks>
Nor are these sources breaking any of wikipedia's rules they are secondary sources and from a number of reputable publications

<user_id=Deli nk>
If you are using ""OR"" to refer to WP:OR, then you are not interpreting that page correctly.  My assessment of the ''Washington Post'' and ''Telegraph'' articles as crappy sensationalist nonsense is not WP:OR, it is my opinion of the quality of those sources.  Surely you can see that the editor that wrote ""air conditioning plays a large role in the inherent sexism and oppression of women in the workplace"" and ""overuse of airconditioning in offices is purely to benefit men"", which is nowhere included in the cited articles, was the one was adding their own original research into Wikipedia?

<user_id=VQuakr>
MRA? Anyways, I joined the discussion when I became aware of it. As explained above, there is nothing ""inherently sexist"" about the subject of this article, air conditioning.

<user_id=Udoks>
There is when people like you deny the real world impact it has on women's working lives. You're denying women of information and education about how the patriarchy is oppressing them every day. You're contributing to sexism by trying to help hide it or excuse it like this.

<user_id=VQuakr>
I didn't deny anything, I explained it to you. Stop with the personal attacks, please.

<user_id=General Ization>
The discussion of someone's theory that the technology known as air conditioning has been abused by some male managers to oppress female workers (aside from the fact that it is itself sexist – who's to say that some female managers haven't oppressed male workers in exactly the same way? Where are the statistics to show otherwise?) belongs in this article no more than the potential and frequent use of handguns and kitchen knives specifically as instruments of domestic abuse belongs in those articles (where it does not appear). Air conditioning is a '''technology''', just as those are '''implements''', and '''technology and implements can be used and abused'''.  It can just as easily be argued that companies that fail to provide air conditioning for their employees in hot and humid climates create unpleasant and inefficient work environments.  I can tell you this much: my wife does not feel the least bit oppressed by air conditioning systems at her work or at home.   '' ''

<user_id=74.12.92.201>
Exactly. This proposed content is WP:COATRACK of the highest order.

<user_id=Udoks>
Patriarchal oppression is core and present in so many aspects of modern life and only by making such things visible and easily seen can we stop the oppression of women. It is not coat racking as this is relevant and real to millions of womens lives in relation to this subject. Why do you presume to speak for all women?

<user_id=74.12.92.201>
Please re-read the WP:COATRACK essay, specifically the section on ""The Criticism Gambit"". The problem is not with the significance of the material, but the fact that its relationship to the rest of the article is tenuous at best.

<user_id=VQuakr>
Udoks, this is not the place to ""explain the ""truth"" or ""reality"" of a current or historical political, religious, or moral issue.""

<user_id=Udoks>
Except this is not some throw away issue. Sexism and patriarchal oppression permeates all aspects of our society and to reach true equality we me call these injustices out. This is not attaching some additional issue this is an issue relevant to all areas of society and denying women easily access to it just furthers their oppression. Is it not denying those trying to right a great wrong by denying them and their work a place on this page? Is it not documenting those wrongs being righting by documenting the existence of their work? These items were reported on mainstream press sites.

<user_id=General Ization>
If you haven't already, see WP:RIGHTGREATWRONGS.  And ""these items"" were speculated upon in lifestyle columns, not hard news articles, by commentators who, I suspect, had twinkles in their eyes when they wrote the articles. (You need, I think, a better sarcasm detector.  Ever watch Andy Rooney?) In any case, neither of these are investigative reporters, and they were engaged in edgy social commentary based on ""research by walking around"", not in investigative journalism.  Dvorak (whose article was basically just regurgitated by Lodi) even takes a playful poke at herself in her article (""Because we’re doing top-notch investigative work here."").  Your attempt to portray either of these columns as hard evidence of ''anything'' is grossly misguided.  The only scientific sources are the ones mentioned by Sanghani, about different metabolic rates for men and women and errors commonly made in configuring climate control systems. But the studies she cites make no claims that this is all a product of some vast male conspiracy – nor does Sanghani, other than her single use of the word ""sexist"" outside of the headline, by which she implies, perhaps correctly, that males are less impacted by this error than females due to their metabolisms.  It's a long way from there to an assertion, much less documented evidence (which is what we need here), of systemic abuse of female workers.  '' ''

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Relevance to the article topic: The initial concern raised by <user_id=124.171.32.15> is about the relevance of the content on occupational sexism to the article on air conditioning. This is a valid point, as the relevance of the content to the main topic of the article is crucial for maintaining the focus and coherence of the article.

2. Quality of sources: <user_id=Deli nk> and <user_id=VQuakr> argue that the sources cited are of low quality and sensationalistic. The quality of sources is important in Wikipedia discussions, as Wikipedia relies on reliable, verifiable sources to back up its content.

3. Original research and neutrality: <user_id=Deli nk> and <user_id=VQuakr> also point out that the content may contain original research and lacks neutrality, which goes against Wikipedia's core content policies of ""No original research"" (WP:NOR) and ""Neutral point of view"" (WP:NPOV).

4. Applicability of content: <user_id=Andy Dingley> and <user_id=Udoks> argue that the content is applicable and relevant to the article because it discusses an aspect of air conditioning. However, <user_id=General Ization> and <user_id=74.12.92.201> counter that the content is a misuse of the article to promote a specific viewpoint, which is known as ""coatracking"" (WP:COATRACK).

5. Personal attacks and civility: <user_id=Udoks> makes personal attacks by suggesting that those who disagree with them are denying the oppression of women and contributing to sexism. Personal attacks are against Wikipedia's civility policy (WP:CIVIL).

6. Righting Great Wrongs: <user_id=Udoks> seems to be using Wikipedia to right great wrongs, which is discouraged by Wikipedia's guidelines (WP:RGW). Wikipedia is not a platform for advocacy or activism.

Overall, the discussion includes valid points about the relevance of content, the quality of sources, and the importance of neutrality and avoiding original research. However, the discussion is marred by personal attacks and a lack of focus on improving the article within Wikipedia's guidelines. The arguments presented by <user_id=124.171.32.15>, <user_id=Deli nk>, <user_id=VQuakr>, and <user_id=General Ization> are generally more aligned with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, while <user_id=Udoks> fails to address these concerns adequately and resorts to personal attacks.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

''Delete the new features sections'''

<user_id=Everyone Dies In the End>
I'm still curious on why you refuse to address that these games get released every year only due to these features. Not to also mention, that if something is written like an advert we tag it with Template:Advert if it's notable so it can be rewritten. We don't delete it. We delete things based on notability not if it's written like an advert. I've told you this many times and you still say the same thing like a broken record.

<user_id=Czar>
''Delete'''. First, ""the crowd is more alive with individuals holding up player signs, wearing costumes"" appears to be a copyright violation from press materials, so that needs to be addressed. Second, if this is important, cite a reliable, secondary source and put it in prose. The list is video game trivia in marketing language on its own.

<user_id=Czar>
Since when did we delete whole sections based on small points. I thought I made myself very clear that this is about the content itself not whether if it's written like an advertisement. We don't delete things based on that alone. We fix them. Not mention, I clearly state they are a lot of verifiable sources on this. Once again we have another wikipedia user who refuses to do a simple google search. Here are three (there's more) on the first page of a google search   .

<user_id=Everyone Dies In the End>
I'd also like to see your thoughts on why we should delete the new features when that's the only reason this game gets produced every year is because of them. Also, if it gets re-written with verifiable sources does that change your thing to keep.

<user_id=Eik Corell>
A lot of video game series like the Call of Duty series has this problem of being hard to distinguish feature wise, but their entries here all have proper sections explaining their gameplay and development aspects without resorting to trivia-style lists. The difference is that these articles have received attention from experienced editors, whereas these lists are generally found on less popular games' articles, added by well-meaning, but inexperienced editors who are not aware of how video game articles should be written or specifically how new information should be added.

<user_id=Eik Corell>
Here's a sample of what you're adding back to the Gameplay section: ""Living crowds: On the next generation, the crowd is more alive with individuals holding up player signs, wearing costumes, and reacting authentically to plays. Over 9,000 new crowd models produces various different types of fans.""
Here's another: ""New modeling system for players and equipment allows for dynamic cloth technology in the next generation, with the players' clothes moving and affecting physics.""
These aren't relevant to gameplay since they're graphical upgrades, and yet they sit in that section of the article, inserted in the form of list of all kinds of additions. Proper video game articles do not have these kinds of lists per WP:GAMECRUFT. WP:GAMECRUFT literally says that lists of gameplay items or concepts should be avoided, and states ""Sometimes a concise summary is appropriate if it is essential to understanding the game or its significance in the industry."", and that's my point - This is literally a list of random stuff, including said gameplay items/concepts, nothing concise about it. It looks and reads like the additions of someone who is new to Wikipedia but haven't read the WP:VG/GL guidelines. It also makes the article seem like an advert. I know it seems like overkill to delete it, but the reason these articles stay in this condition is because nobody came along to do this in the articles' infancy, and so new users come to the article and simply add more trivia to the lists they find.

<user_id=Everyone Dies In the End>
Okay, then you are fine if the sections were expanded? You realize you are arguing based on guidelines that the New Features don't belong period?

<user_id=Eik Corell>
The New Features section doesn't belong in its current form; the information it has must be converted to prose kept within a gameplay section and a development section. Even then, one needs to be wary of using the existence of these features as the foundation of the gameplay section since they're merely changes from the preceding game, whose formula hasn't been explained to the reader yet.

<user_id=Everyone Dies In the End>
You kind of just shot your argument in the foot now. You realize that what you could have done is A) Do those fixes yourself. or B) Put it a gameplay section and tag it for expansion and then tag the new features subsection for clean up and explain it with the tag. '''That's why those tags exist and what they are for.''' We don't delete content like that.
What you are doing now isn't helpful to wikipedia in any way. You just delete content and don't explain what you think needs to be done. Deleting content then hiding behind guildlines that don't agree with you just makes it worse.
You yourself just said that if re written and in a full gameplay section it's fine. This is something tags could fix perfectly fine (if you don't want to fix it yourself).

<user_id=Eik Corell>
It's my experience that non-popular/uncared for video game articles generally sit with these tags for years with no improvement, that's why I delete such sections instead of tagging - This practice seems to be a much better strategy as far as yielding results go. I'm not familiar enough with these games to be able to write or write a gameplay section from scratch, and due to the other games' gameplay sections being like this one, I can't glean important information needed to write one from those, either. Check out the [[NHL_13|NHL 13] article's history for an example. That article has been in a similar state since its inception. I approach this whole issue from the angle that it's much worse to let a bad section stay in the unlikely hope that someone will come along and try to pry something from it or refactor it because I simply do not see it happening across the hundreds of video game articles I run across. It really only happens on popular articles with experienced editors present as I said.

<user_id=Everyone Dies In the End>
You want to know why when you tag nothing changes? Because of editors like yourself. You delete peoples written content (do not even alert them on it) and then hide behind oh if I tag it, it'll just stay there. NO you tag it and alert the people who wrote it. (you know help those inexperienced editors inside of chasing away editors like you're doing now). If a year then goes by then you may have an argument. Right now you don't. Not to mention the fact, you seem to cite the same Guildine over and over again when you keep getting told (by now not only myself) that it doesn't apply. Then you restore your edits during an active discussion. Violating wikipedia guildlines.

<user_id=Eik Corell>
I can't alert and constantly debate every single editor who's contributed to these unencyclopedic categories and lists that I routinely remove from articles, I mean we're often talking hundreds of editors adding to them over many years, although when they contact me, I make a habit of at least re-iterating what guidelines I removed them by. As I said, the tagging system works for well-frequented articles, not for these types of articles where experienced authors simply don't bother. In this case, the bad article quality isn't because nobody tagged the unencyclopedic categories. Editors experienced with the WP:VG/GL that actually take a look at all these articles seldom need these tags because it's not hard to see why a bullet point list of graphical features doesn't belong in the gameplay section. I generally do not add or rewrite stuff in significant portions because my presence here is primarily focused on cleaning up articles per WP:VG/GL, and that's what I feel most capable and comfortable doing. I've cited the guideline based on which I removed these lists. You're arguing for its inclusion, even though in its current state it's clearly in violation of WP:GAMECRUFT. Why don't you write it yourself? This would cut out any speculation about whether someone will or will not come along and eventually fix it.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User ""Everyone Dies In the End"" argues against the deletion of the ""New Features"" section, emphasizing the importance of these features in the annual release of the game and suggesting that the content should be rewritten rather than deleted if it appears promotional. This user also points out that content should be deleted based on notability, not on the writing style, and provides sources to support the notability of the features.

2. User ""Czar"" supports deletion, citing a potential copyright violation and the promotional nature of the content. This user suggests that if the content is important, it should be rewritten in prose and supported by reliable, secondary sources.

3. User ""Eik Corell"" argues that the ""New Features"" section does not belong in its current form and should be integrated into a gameplay section and a development section in prose, not as a list. This user also references Wikipedia's guidelines on video game articles (WP:GAMECRUFT) to support their argument against the inclusion of trivial lists.

4. User ""Everyone Dies In the End"" counters by suggesting that the sections could be expanded and restructured rather than deleted, and that tags could be used to indicate the need for cleanup and expansion.

5. User ""Eik Corell"" explains their experience with non-popular video game articles and their tendency to remain unimproved despite tagging. This user prefers deletion as a strategy to improve article quality and admits to not being familiar enough with the games to rewrite the sections themselves.

6. User ""Everyone Dies In the End"" criticizes the approach of deleting content without alerting the original contributors and suggests that tagging and communication could help inexperienced editors improve the content.

7. User ""Eik Corell"" defends their approach by stating the impracticality of alerting and debating with the large number of contributors to these sections and reiterates their adherence to Wikipedia's video game guidelines.

Overall, both sides present arguments with some merit. ""Everyone Dies In the End"" focuses on the potential for improvement and the importance of the features to the game's annual release cycle. ""Eik Corell"" and ""Czar"" emphasize adherence to Wikipedia's guidelines and the need for content to be encyclopedic and not promotional. However, ""Eik Corell"" also admits to a lack of action in terms of rewriting or improving the content themselves, which weakens their argument slightly. The discussion could benefit from a more collaborative approach to improving the article, rather than a binary choice between deletion and retention of the content as is.

Fanpov tag March 2015

<user_id=DrFleischman>
The recent addition of a series of obscure awards throughout the Career section gives the article a fan-oriented POV. Less notable awards should be omitted, and the article could use a more general balancing with negative material, which there is plenty of out there.

<user_id=Mach7X77>
Again, I'm no fan of Dana Loesch but I am a woman. The distinctions listed are higher accolades than many which are included in other living persons biographies on WP and they go unchallenged. The idea that the awards didn't have an impact on her notoriety and rise is foolish. Further the inclusion of particular distinctions of her political persuasion may be considered by some (myself included) as negative material. It is how you view it. The facts are what they are and introduction of ""negative material"" invites the inclusion of actual positive material. I think the facts are what they are and are always neutral. WP practices instruct us to only include neutral facts in the spirit of consensus.

<user_id=DrFleischman>
I'm not sure what much of that means. I stand by the tag and I believe the inclusion of the large number of obscure awards gives readers the impression that we're going out of our way to puff up the piece and make Loesch look good, whether that's your intention or not. Please do not remove the tag without first obtaining consensus.

<user_id=Mach7X77>
If you don't understand what that means then I cannot help you. You have already demonstrated that you don't understand the qualifications that publishers use for a Best Selling Author. Your insistance on questioning sources and adding your bias to this is beyond the bounds of working towards any consensus, it is antithetical to consensus. Much has been changed to your satisfaction and you seem to want to drive for some odd sense of dictatorial type editorial control over the page. The awards and distinctions are not obscure in any way and are central to the story of any rising media personality. Your insistence on them being obscure doesn't make Nielsen, AIM, Biz Journal etc... obscure. If you aren't wanting this to be an actual biographical page then perhaps you should start an ""I hate Dana Loesch"" page on facebook. The biographies of thousands of other people on Wikipedia feature far more obscure awards and distinctions as this page. Obscure would mean that they weren't journaled or heralded on many sites. Your tone is personally insulting to me and anyone who would present an accurate, thorough and fair biography and also seem to be anti-feminist in nature. There are thousands of other pages that need your immediate attention if your personal criteria that you use on this page is consistent. I have to wonder what your end-game really is here. There is no consensus for the tag and it will be removed every time you introduce your bias. If something makes a person look good or bad in YOUR EYES isn't the qualification of its inclusion or omission, facts are just facts, omission is bias and conjecture is forbidden.

<user_id=DrFleischman>
Most of your comment seems unproductive. I only have 2 things to say:
1. These awards and distinctions are obscure for the very reason that they're not journaled or heralded on many sites. We should only be considering independent, reliable sources as others have self-interested reasons to puff up the notability of awards. This is a pretty common type of analysis all across Wikipedia. Show me the independent sources demonstrating the notability of these awards.
2. Do not remove the tag until consensus is reached. Doing so is contrary to the tag and accepted tagging procedures. The tag expressly says the article ''may be'' non-neutral, it doesn't say the article ''is'' non-neutral. I am re-adding the tag.

<user_id=Mach7X77>
1. Do not add a POV tag without consensus - it IS against WP practices and standards, you show me the sources and consensus that the distinctions and awards - which are factual and listed across the internet in regards to Mrs. Loesch - are somehow obscure and not journaled when they are. You are like the guy that said Loesch wasn't even notable enough to have a WP page to begin with. Ridiculous.
2. You are not the sole arbiter of what should hap[pen on this page. I have compromised for the spirit of consensus, your edits seems to be from a hateful point of view.

<user_id=Mordor2>
Not sure what is meant by ""obscure awards"" when chronicling a person's rise to prominence. The awards show a shift from popular thought writing to a more conservatively focused writing. I think it's important information. I'm wondering why the Post dispatch let her go with an award winning column... Was it based on her ideas? I also find it interesting that someone would claim this is a ""fan POV"" when there is very unflattering information included in the biography; college dropout, banned from shows, Breitbart spirit award (not a good feather IMHO). I see no reason to flag this page. I'm ambivalent towards Loesch and this page is balanced as is. A tag like that should not be added without consensus. While I'm not a feminist by any means, I have to agree with   on this.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. <user_id=DrFleischman> raises concerns about the neutrality of the article, suggesting that the inclusion of numerous obscure awards could give a fan-oriented POV. The user is focused on the notability and relevance of the awards and suggests balancing the article with negative material for neutrality.

2. <user_id=Mach7X77> defends the inclusion of the awards, arguing that they are significant and have impacted Dana Loesch's notoriety. This user also suggests that the facts are neutral and that the inclusion of negative material is subjective and could be seen as bias.

3. <user_id=DrFleischman> requests independent sources to establish the notability of the awards and insists on following Wikipedia's accepted tagging procedures, which includes not removing the tag until consensus is reached.

4. <user_id=Mach7X77> argues that the awards are journaled and recognized across the internet, implying their notability. The user also accuses <user_id=DrFleischman> of bias and personal animosity towards the subject of the article.

5. <user_id=Mordor2> provides a third perspective, questioning the term ""obscure awards"" and suggesting that the awards are relevant to understanding the subject's career trajectory. This user also notes that the article contains unflattering information, which counters the claim of a fan-oriented POV.

The discussion quality is mixed. On one hand, <user_id=DrFleischman> is adhering to Wikipedia's guidelines on neutrality and notability, which is a strong point for maintaining the integrity of the article. On the other hand, <user_id=Mach7X77> provides a counterargument that the awards are widely recognized and relevant to the subject's career, although the user's tone becomes more confrontational and less focused on the content dispute as the discussion progresses. <user_id=Mordor2> adds value by providing a neutral stance and questioning the basis of the ""obscure awards"" claim, which helps to balance the discussion.

However, the discussion is somewhat diminished by the increasing personalization of the debate and the lack of focus on finding a resolution based on Wikipedia's content policies and guidelines. The argument quality would be higher if the participants focused more on the content and policy aspects and less on personal accusations.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5
"<user_id=DevilWearsBrioni>
This was explained to you on the talk page. You were warned for OR:ing. I have yet to see you actually rebut this, instead you seem more bent on accusing me of disruption, as if disruption by other editors is an excuse to break the no original research policy. Also, I would appreciate if you refrained from making false accusations about me. I did not break the 3RR.

<user_id=SilentResident>
I am afraid you have not understood that the lead of the article should present every important information from the main body of the article. Alexikoua has provided sources on this matter which clearly is not OR:ing, and still, in spite of this you have chosen once again, in later edits, to REMOVE COMPLETELY these sources. What you have done is: 1) Unexplained removal of Alexikoua's sources, 2) Disruptive edits, 3) 3RR breach, 4) violation of WP:Lead, 5) manipulation of sources, 6) Failed to get the Point, 7) POV edits with positions expressed by ultranationalist political parties in Albania, 8) You have failed to reach a consensus with other community members in the article's Talk Page for your edits and insisted with them in spite of objections and concerns expressed by the others. And more. Do I have to explain what you have done? My advice to you as a friend: you have a last chance. Think twice before keeping on with this behavior, because in a such event, you will be reported to the Administrator's Noticeboard. Have a good day, DevilWearsBrioni.

<user_id=DevilWearsBrioni>
I'm still waiting for you to point me to the source that makes the claim that Greek state policy was a consequence of Muslim Chams burning Christian villages. This is what you wrote: ""many of the Muslim Chams that were inhabiting western Epirus, sided with the Ottomans against the advancing Greeks and had formed irregular armed units and were burning Greek inhabited settlements and towns, with only few Albanian beys willing to accept a Greek rule in the region. '''This led the Greek state to adopt policies that aimed to drive out Muslim Chams from their territory'''"".
Please point me to a specific sentence (or two!) which supports the bolded part. That's all I'm asking for and I'll gladly concede that you were not OR:ing if you in fact can show me this. Let's keep this factual. As for 3RR Breach (still no evidence, just accusations), manipulation of sources (again, no evidence), positions expressed by ultranationalist political parties in Albania, etc, I would be very curious to see how your evidence for these accusations fare on the Administrator's noticeboard. By initiating a report, you're required to provide evidence, and consequently it would make it a lot easier for me to refute, instead of going about it this way where you can accuse me of all possible things without repercussions.

<user_id=SilentResident>
The Tsoutsoumpis' sources about '''the Greek government's responses to Cham Albanian raiding and burning the Greek villages by adopting policies against them, such as arming Greek guerillas in the regions where Chams lived''', covers the first sentence. The second is from Baltsioti's sources which describe '''the Greek government's mistrust of the Chams eventually leading them adopt policies of expelling them from Epirus'''. As you can see, this is not a case of OR:ing at all. What case is this? Judging from the complete removal of the first half of the paragraph, it seems you were not happy with this addition. For reasons that have to do with certain political views and beliefs? Or you think it was too big and made the lead too bloated? Note that it was pretty short phrase, as supposed as per WP:Lead, nor a full-scale copy from what is said on the main body. Or maybe you saw the phrase containing different implications and that due to the complexity of the events of that time, a bigger and more precise phrase could clear things out for you? Maybe yes. But your actions contradict this. Your actions to remove this all together, and even the sources for it when they were added by Alexikoua later. Alexikoua took that bolded phrase in question and re-worded it precisely to leave no room for misunderstanding about this, accompanied with the sources, and that could have covered any concerns, but even so, you have reverted his edits. Instead of helping our efforts in summarizing the article into the lead, you have blocked the other people's efforts in that direction, even when the sources were provided. Sorry to say but your OR:ing accusation is not convincing, and your behavior contrasts that of Alexikoua and Resnjari. Resnjari and Alexikoua contribute positively by noting where a phrase could have any problems, and improve upon it with precise re-wording, to make it BETTER, not remove it. And you? You just click on revert button all the time... How is that helping, dear DevilWearsBrioni? How? With this behavior of yours, you are giving the impression that you are the owner of the article and thus, you decide what stays and what not, without consulting with others first, and without tolerating their contributions. Remember the last time I have warned you? If you ever try to remove these sources again, you will be reported and blocked from editing this page. This is not OR:ing and you may refuse to get the point even now for the lead, my friend, but this behavior cannot be tolerated. I am watching the page closely from now and on and it is on my watch list.

<user_id=DevilWearsBrioni>
First of all, Tsoutsoumpis was introduced as a source by Alexikoua after I had warned you for OR:ing. You never cited him when you added ”''This led the Greek state to adopt policies that aimed to drive out Muslim Chams from their territory''”, so I fail to see how bringing up Tsoutsoumpis now is a valid argument. In fact, it's quite telling that you bring up Tsoutsoumpis, it shows you don't have a leg to stand on.

<user_id=DevilWearsBrioni>
Second, you are distorting what Tsoutsoumpis says. He does not claim that Greek state policy was adopted as a consequence of the burning of Christian villages, that’s merely your interpretation and personal analysis. Instead, he asserts that local civillians were armed by the Greek and Ottoman governments; ''Muslim bands'' raided villages, and ”Greek irregulars responded in kind from January 1913 onwards”. Apart from the fact that you’re falsely equating Muslim bands with Muslim Chams, interpreting the ”arming of Greek irregulars as a response to Muslim bands raiding villages” as a form of ”Greek state policy which aimed to drive out Muslim Chams”, is arguably a desperate and farfetched attempt to correlate the two. Not only that, you are demonstrably wrong. Baltsiotis writes that state policy was ''""embedded in the prevailing nationalistic ideology of the '''Interwar period'''""''. Consequently, even if you want to argue that arming irregulars during a war is a form of state policy, the time periods do not coincide.

<user_id=DevilWearsBrioni>
As for Baltsiotis and ''”the Greek government's mistrust of the Chams eventually leading them adopt policies of expelling them from Epirus”'': can you point me to the specific sentence? Where does Baltsiotis make the claim that state policies were adopted as a consequence of village burnings? Also, when and how did this ”mistrust” emerge according to Baltsiotis? Perhaps before the 19th century?

<user_id=DevilWearsBrioni>
'”Yet this situation was not a novelty. Prior to this period, Chamouria was already a nuisance both for the Greek state and the Christians of Epirus who identified themselves as Greeks.[…] Concealing the existence of the Albanian language appeared as a concept as soon as the possibility of Greek expansion into Epirus appeared. Dimitrios Hassiotis, a historian and politician who supported Greek claims, writes in 1887 that in the whole of the Chamouria region, only in Paramythia do “some of the inhabitants understand the Albanian language for commercial reasons” (author’s emphasis). The initial distortion of facts was followed by an effort to account for the allegedly “occasional” use of Albanian. This “appeal to hope” is not only applied to the distortion of the linguistic reality of the area as perceived by non natives, but is extended to a wider spectrum of facts and evaluations. An example of the way this “appeal to hope” was accepted as reality is that Greek officers in the interwar period truly believe that Italy and “Albanian propaganda” are to blame for the reactions of the Muslims in Chamouria and not Greek policies implemented in the area.”''
'”'''The behavior of the Greek Army, in conjunction with the legislation implemented at the time, deeply affected the Muslims and confirmed the first serious fissure between the Christian communities and the Greek State on one side, and the Muslim communities on the other'''. Tensions between Muslims and Christians in the area began in the late 19th century when the Christian element gradually improved its financial and social status.”''
'”For a more detailed narration of the fighting and the battles that occurred in the area during late 1912, '''the use of local population and the burning of villages by both sides''' see K. D. Sterghiopoulos”''

<user_id=DevilWearsBrioni>
On the talk page I have argued that both sides engaged in burning villages. Yet, you maintain that it's important to mention that Muslim Chams burned Christian Orthodox settlements in the lede. Why is that? Do you intend to show and suggest that these events caused the Greek state to adopt discriminative policies against Muslim Chams, and will you be able to explain on the OR/NPOV noticeboard how this reasoning isn't suggestive/UNDUE and POV/OR? Furthermore, could you tell me why the following is POV: ''""Though at first reluctant in joining Ottoman forces, Muslim Chams – regarded as enemies by the Greek army – sided with the Ottomans in late 1912, while local Christians were enlisted in the Greek forces, giving rise to local conflicts.""'' Does this sentence alone not encapsulate the events that transpired? What is specifically missing there? The burning of villages committed by both sides? Or by only one side?

<user_id=DevilWearsBrioni>
Lastly, like I've told you before, I certainly don't mind admin intervention and I would have preferred it if you already went ahead with it. Repeating it ad nauseam does not help your case.

<user_id=SilentResident>
Yep sure, keep telling yourself this and that. I am sorry, but the Administrators won't like when any invalid and non-existent cases of OR:ing are used to justify any edit warring attitudes and disruptive behaviors of your part on Wikipedia. I could be very excited to see how such an argument can make any sense to anyone, and especially to the Admins.

<user_id=SilentResident>
And please do not continue with your endless arguments, it became clear and evident that this never-ending debate won't get anywhere. I could appreciate if my talk page is kept practical and compact. Thanks.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Accusations of Original Research (OR):** DevilWearsBrioni is accusing SilentResident of engaging in original research by making a connection between historical events and state policies without providing a direct source for this specific claim. SilentResident counters by citing sources that they believe support their edits.

2. **Citing Sources:** SilentResident provides specific sources to back up their claims, mentioning Tsoutsoumpis and Baltsiotis. However, DevilWearsBrioni argues that these sources were introduced after the fact and do not directly support the claim that Greek state policy was a consequence of Muslim Chams burning Christian villages.

3. **Interpretation of Sources:** DevilWearsBrioni points out that the interpretation of the sources by SilentResident may be incorrect, as the sources do not explicitly make the connection that SilentResident claims they do. This suggests that SilentResident's argument may indeed involve some degree of original research or interpretation beyond what the sources directly state.

4. **Relevance and Focus:** The discussion is focused on the relevance and accuracy of the content being added to the Wikipedia article. Both parties are attempting to ensure that the information is accurate and verifiable, which is in line with Wikipedia's content policies.

5. **Civility and Constructiveness:** The dialogue, while heated, remains relatively civil. Both users are making an effort to argue their points without resorting to personal attacks. However, there is a level of frustration evident in the exchange, and SilentResident's final message suggests a desire to end the debate rather than continue a constructive dialogue.

6. **Understanding of Wikipedia Policies:** Both users demonstrate an understanding of Wikipedia's policies, such as the no original research policy and the three-revert rule (3RR). They use these policies to support their arguments, which shows a level of engagement with Wikipedia's content guidelines.

7. **Resolution and Consensus:** The discussion does not seem to be moving towards a resolution or consensus. Instead, it appears to be at a stalemate, with both users holding firm to their positions.

Overall, the discussion shows a reasonable level of engagement with the subject matter and Wikipedia's policies. Both parties provide arguments and cite sources, although there is a disagreement over the interpretation of these sources. The discussion could be improved with a more collaborative approach to finding a resolution, rather than a back-and-forth that seems to be leading to an impasse.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Guccisamsclubs>
Yes there are sources that call him revisionist, but ALL of them refer a book written 1985. So its highly misleading to imply that these attacks on Getty's ""revisionism"" take into account his voluminous later work. And Getty's main ""revisionist"" sin appears to be his thesis that Stalin was far from the only one to blame, and that other apparatchiks also had a stake in the purges. His argument is that the culprit was the system. The thesis is seems pretty sensible and is in fact ''more'' damning of the Soviet system that ""traditional"" Stalin-centric accounts.

<user_id=Brustopher>
Getty is definitely within the revisionist school and people who agree with him such as Fitzpatrick described themselves as within a self-identified revisionist school (can't recall if he does). However, this article clearly seems to be biased against Getty by ommission, leaving out the nature of his later work in the archives which is far less dubious. I would remedy this but I've recently graduated and lost access to all my resources. Furthmore, while I may remembering completely wrong I dont believe Getty ever denied responsibility to Stalin completely for the purges (and the one source mvbw quoted doesnt seem to necessarily indicate this.  Also there's an article in Kritika 5:1 in response to Martin Malia (which I no longer have access too), which is a really good rebuttal to comparisons between Getty and Irving that have been included in this article, and probably needs to be included for the sake of balance. If anyone has access to this can they please add it. For the time being I'm adding a NPOV tag.

<user_id=My very best wishes>
If you want to include more sourced materials that describe his work in a more ""positive"" light, you are very welcome. There is no any disagreement about it, and therefore no reason for NPOV tag.

<user_id=Guccisamsclubs>
. I am not saying that Getty's work is not ""revisionist"". The problem is how the term is used in the article. First, ""American revisionist historian"" is used to ''define'' Getty in the lede sentence. ""Revisionist"" is not definitive in the same way that ""American historian"" is. But even worse than this, is how the term ""revisionism"" is itself defined further down. The article cites only attacks on Getty, which paint Getty's revisionism as: part of a ""gaggle""; analogous to holocaust denier David Irving; a ""rehabilitation of Stalin"". And as we both agree, the article takes his outdate ''Origins of the Great Purges'' as the point of departure to attack his revisionism, ignoring all later work. All in all, ""revisionist"" is used in the article as a slur that sets the tone for an attack piece, not as a neutral description of his work. This is why I recommended moving the term out of the lede sentence.
Other than that, I wholeheartedly agree with your points about neutrality. You don't need your institution to get the sources—you can get them all from sci(dash)hub(dot)cc.

<user_id=My very best wishes>
He ''is'' usually mentioned in sources as a ""revisionist sovietologist"", i.e. here. Others describe him as ""Stalin's apologist"" , and this is not based on any his individual book, but based on everything he published. No wonder, because he claims that Great Purge was not planned by Stalin, among other things.

<user_id=Guccisamsclubs>
Have you read Getty? Can you cite where he says Stalin was not to blame? If so add it to the article.

<user_id=Guccisamsclubs>
American Neocon publications  (''weekly standard'' and to a lesser extent ''world affairs'') are not sufficient to label a living person as ""Stalin apologist"". Clearly, Soviet studies are a politicized field due to the Cold War, so it's not surprising to see some axe-grinding and insults in print. It is therefore easy to cherry pick the most ''extreme'' attacks on Getty and make an article out of them, ignoring what Getty actually wrote and ignoring the hundreds of academic sources that take his work seriously. This article basically likens him to David Irving and that's absolutely insane.

<user_id=Brustopher>
Having read through my old history notes again, Getty doesn't say that Stalin isnt to blame and has no responsibility. He instead says that he is rejected a ""Great men"" style of history and instead focusing on the structural causes of the Great Terror within society and the state (letter to the editors of Kritika 5:1), and that the style of Marxist ideology of the Soviet Union required the creation of paranoid conspiracies in response to failuire (Road to Terror, written with Naumov). The style this article is written however does seem to imply that he's a dodgy Stalin lover. In particular the way the Kirov question was put right after the thing about Irving to equate the question of who was responsible for Kirov's assassination (by no means a solved question) to Holocaust denial. The praise Getty's later work has received from people who are undeniably 100% anti-Stalinist such as Roy Medvedev, make the weighting of this article very biased. Also on a more negative note, Getty pre-archival numbers for victims of the purges were notoriously low, so if there's anywhere it's right for the article to be more negative it's there. With regards to the revisionism label, would it help if I include a link to historical revisionism in the lede? Getty is basically one of the most well known historians of the Soviet Revisionist school, so to leave out the fact that he is a Revisionist from the lede would be a grave omission.

<user_id=Guccisamsclubs>
The lede is fine for now, although I still think its a good idea to remove ""revisionist"" from the lede definition, if not necessarily the lead section. I would not be surprised at all if Getty's numbers from the 1980's were notoriously low, but I've searched his landmark ''Origins'' and found no estimates of any kind there. The only citable secondary source I found on this is Haynes & Kler's Denial'', a book devoted to smoking out academics perceived as soft on Communism. If Getty ever put out a low estimate, I am sure they'd be all over it:
'In Denial'' is a one of the more worthwhile citations in the article (unlike World Affairs and Conquest's letters to the editor), though it needs to be cited a little more accurately and not in Wikipedia's voice. Quotes from Getty on this issue would be helpful too. On the other hand, Getty ''repeatedly'' cites Khrushchev's claim about Stalin signing several hundreds lists of victims, so I am not sure how far H&K;'s allegation that Getty saw stalin as a ""moderate"" who was not responsible for much repression can be taken.

<user_id=Kingsindian>
The question of whether Getty is to be described as ""revisionist"" in the lead.  Firstly, several sources cited above (this) and this) refer to Getty's ""revisionist"" work, not Getty as a ""revisionist historian"" (several do say the latter). Secondly, do most of the scholarly sources describe him as ""revisionist""? That has not been argued, let alone shown. Thirdly, a description can be accurate without being the primary or even useful descriptor. Niall Ferguson is conservative, Robert Conquest was anti-Communist, E. H. Carr was leftist somewhat sympathetic to communism: none of them are described with a descriptor. Eric Hobsbawm is indeed described as Marxist, so there's that on the other side. The question is: what does the insertion of the label ""revisionist"" add except giving a faint aura of ""not mainstream""? I am removing it for now since I do not think WP:ONUS is satisfied.   

<user_id=Guccisamsclubs>
I'm fine with removing it from the lead entirely since ""revisionism"" is already mentioned in body. Anything but ""is an American revisionist historian"" in the opening sentence is OK by me. Having said that, the POV issues identified by Brustopher seem more serious, so I hope we won't get bogged down arguing over label placement.

<user_id=Archgetty>
I am Arch Getty, the author in question. I don't know if it's proper for me to be here, nor do I understand how to use it.  Anyway, I have indeed added clarifications, data, and recommended readings to the page.  Each time, within days (or as in the last case) hours, someone comes in and deletes my additions and changes and re-introduces baseless attacks, including even insisting on a false job title for me after I had corrected it!  By the way, does anybody know if I have any recourse to stop this?

<user_id=Brustopher>
This isnt just a vague descriptor, revisionism was clearly defined school of thought in Soviet historiography that was opposed to the approach of the totalitarian school. Authors such as Sheila Fitzpatrick self-identified as revisionists (don't know if Getty did), and its a commonly used label when discussing the works of historians of the Soviet Union such as Getty. To leave it out of the lede would be like writing an article on Marc Bloch and failing to mention the Annales School in the lede. Revisionism isnt a dirty word in historiography and doesnt mean ""not mainstream."" Indeed some revisionist schools such as that of the English Reformation are very much more mainstream than those they were initially ""revising"" (for lack of a better word). It's only bc we live in bizarro-world of Wikipedia, where bands of ""rational skeptics"" roam the land making every single article all about them and how great they are at debunking things, that the title of revisionism (appropriated by the Nazis and holocaust deniers for credibility) is associated with pseudohistory.

<user_id=My very best wishes>
I agree. To put it simple, his work was described as ""revisionist"" in almost every 3rd party source, especially by people who do not belong to his ""school"". Perhaps this should be clarified/balanced by quoting/using more sources. Now, speaking about our rules, word ""revisionist"" was on the page for a long time, i.e. in stable version. If anyone wants to remove it, he needs consensus to remove.

Not at home right now so can't give a detailed response to your questions. Just one tip, make sure not to use the word ""defamatory"" in anything you post here or else people will try and get you blocked on a bureaucratic technicality. Will give a more detailed explanation of how to navigate this hellhole of a website soon although it probably worth reading the COI thing mvbw linked..

Are you trying to get him blocked or something? I have to say that's pretty low.

No, I only gave him links to relevant WP policies/guidelines and asked him a simple question at this point. This is a reasonable question.

<user_id=Kingsindian>
Wikipedia is enough of a bureaucratic nightmare than one does not need to add to it. If the account/IP is indeed J. Arch Getty, it would be better to cut them some slack. It's their biography after all.   

<user_id=Brustopher>
MVBW the technicality I was referring to is that oft weaponised delightful policy known as WP:NLT, which gets sprung on people complaining about their biography the second they mention words like ""defamatory"" that have legal usage. That said, I agree with what Kingsindian has written above.  Your best bets at correcting false or misleading information about yourself is by posting about it on WP:BLPN, and asking for help there. Alternatively there is something akin to a customer support service called WP:OTRS, but keep in mind its heavily backlogged. Editing your article is usually a bad idea and at the very best frowned upon. Best not to do it unless something evidently and obviously false is added, or if it is vandalised. What issues do you currently have with this article?

<user_id=Carrite>
Brustopher is 100% on the mark with everything he says above, this speaking as someone who did a year of grad school in Russian area studies in the late 1980s and was an outspoken revisionist at a school (University of Washington) dominated by traditionalists. Since then, the archives have opened, and what do you know, the scholarly estimates of executions in the Terror of 1937-38 by historians like Jerry Hough and Arch Getty (< 1 million) turned out to be on the mark, vs. the gross exaggerations for political effect by traditionalist/totalitarian school historians like Conquest and Solzhenitsyn, who argued tens of millions. The so-called revisionists were more or less right, the conservatives way off — imagine that. Today the ''big majority of historians of the Soviet Union in the United States'' are more or less new historians/cultural historians/social historians/bottom-up historians (whatever you want to call the so-called Revisionists) and the number of Cold War totalitarian sword clangers is very small — basically because their fundamental premise of an unchanging totalitarianism, unchangeable through internal forces, was belied by Gorbachev and the events after.

<user_id=Carrite>
This doesn't keep a certain number of anti-communists, predominantly from Eastern Europe, from churning the old mill. That esteemed UCLA full professor Arch Getty's BLP is nothing more than a football for POV warriors is pretty disgusting, but nothing new.

<user_id=Kingsindian>
I have already posted on WP:BLPN and Wikiproject Russia, by the way.   

",0,"The discussion revolves around the use of the term ""revisionist"" in the lead section of a Wikipedia article about historian J. Arch Getty. The participants debate whether the term is appropriate, whether it is used as a pejorative, and how Getty's work should be characterized in light of his own contributions and the field's reception of his research.

Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Guccisamsclubs argues that the term ""revisionist"" is not definitive and is used in a biased way in the article. They suggest that the term is being used to discredit Getty rather than describe his work neutrally. This argument is based on the concern for neutrality and the accurate representation of a living person's work.

2. Brustopher supports the inclusion of ""revisionist"" in the lead, explaining that it is a well-defined school of thought in Soviet historiography and that Getty's work aligns with this school. They argue that omitting the term would be a significant omission, akin to not mentioning Marc Bloch's association with the Annales School. This argument is based on the importance of context and the recognition of scholarly schools of thought.

3. My very best wishes points out that Getty is often described as ""revisionist"" in third-party sources and that this description is not solely based on his individual book but on his body of work. They emphasize the need for consensus to change a stable version of the article. This argument is based on the prevalence of the term in scholarly discourse and the Wikipedia principle of stability.

4. Kingsindian questions the utility of the ""revisionist"" label in the lead, suggesting that it might give an aura of non-mainstream without adding substantial information. They argue for the removal of the term based on the principle that a description can be accurate without being the primary descriptor. This argument is based on the consideration of what is most informative for the reader.

5. Arch Getty himself enters the discussion, expressing frustration at the editing process and the portrayal of his work. He seeks advice on how to correct what he sees as inaccuracies. This intervention highlights the challenges faced by subjects of biographical articles in correcting information about themselves.

6. Carrite defends the revisionist school of thought, arguing that archival evidence has vindicated the lower estimates of executions during the Terror of 1937-38 made by historians like Getty. They criticize the politicization of the discussion and the treatment of Getty's biography as a ""football for POV warriors."" This argument is based on the vindication of scholarly research through evidence.

Overall, the discussion is characterized by a mix of well-reasoned arguments that consider the importance of neutrality, the recognition of scholarly schools, the stability of article content, and the challenges faced by living subjects of biographical articles. The participants engage with each other's points, cite policies, and bring in external evidence to support their positions. The discussion is generally coherent, though it does involve some tension and disagreement.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Proposal/compromise

<user_id=N-HH>
How about keeping it, but moving it to the ""related topics"" section rather than retaining it as a confirmed anarchist ""school of thought""? Also, on the related issue of ""National Anarchism"", I support removing that altogether. While anarcho-capitalism has some purchase as an ideology, at least in the US, and undoubtedly has links to anarchism proper, that seems to be just an utterly fringe far-right thing which no connection whatsoever to anarchism as commonly understood. '''''' '''/'''

<user_id=Knight of BAAWA>
No. Anarchocapitalism is a confirmed anarchist school of thought despite what the haters, e.g. those like Eduen who use scarce-quotes, want to believe. It belongs in the list of schools of thought. -

<user_id=Interrexconsul>
Anarcho-capitalism is only a 'confirmed' school of anarchist thought by its own adherents. No sources that discuss anarchism in general refer to it as a legitimate branch of anarchism other than perhaps to dismiss it. I agree it does belong in the 'issues' section, but not as a coherent school of anarchist thought. Knight of BAAWA apparently wants to promote Ancap-ism since it seems to be a topic of interest to them, but that does not increase its status as being a notable branch of anarchist thought.

<user_id=24.197.253.43>
This is what I propose; and indeed it is already there under ""Issues"".

<user_id=Knight of BAAWA>
So the Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought dismisses it? Hmmmm. No. Or its Encyclopedia of Political Thought? Nope. Please don't just make up things when we can find the sources which show that you're wrong. -

<user_id=Interrexconsul>
You really seem to have a heavy emotional investment in this issue. I'm not sure if the attitude you're looking at this with is constructive. And I never contended that the sources you list dismiss it as an ideology, merely that they don't align its belief system with anarchism as a whole. Lastly, nobody can be right or ""wrong"" as you described in as far as what ideology is part of a school of thought. You are clearly coming at this with a biased POV.

<user_id=FreeKnowledgeCreator>
I agree with Knight of BAAWA; there is no reason to remove anarcho-capitalism from the template simply to satisfy those who dislike or disagree with it being characterized as a form of anarchism.

<user_id=Malik Shabazz>
I feel strongly that the template should include a link to Anarcho-capitalism, and I don't particularly like the idea that new or unpopular anarchist movements should be kicked off the template or moved to another section. What's next: should we debate whether one can be an anarchist and follow a religion (bye, bye, Christian anarchism) or whether former black nationalists can really be anarchists (bye, bye, Black anarchism). I look forward to the bloodletting. —  /

<user_id=Interrexconsul>
The issue is that there is more to it than 'unpopularity', while Anarcho-capitalism is undoubtedly that amongst anarchists, the relevant issue is that the only group that purports it to be an actual school of anarchist thought are an-caps, not outside scholarly sources. It can certainly be linked as a relevant issue, but to include it as being a school of thought would be akin to include National Socialism as being a school of thought of Socialism simply because retains the same part of the name and it supports a strong centralized state. Anyone educated about the two philosophies would agree that while the two do share a handful of traits in the broadest of strokes, to claim they are related ideologies would be silly. The same goes for anarcho-capitalism and anarchism. While anarchism and anarcho-capitalism both share the trait of wanting to dissolve/minimize the state, the similarities end there. Anarchists of every other stripe believe in dissolving hierarchies and private property, while anarcho-capitalists believe in one or both of the two (depending on whose interpretation to which you subscribe). The philosophies simply aren't particularly related other than the controversy over whether they are.

<user_id=N-HH>
The problems with anarcho-capitalism and ""national anarchism"", the latter especially, are more fundamental than people not liking them or being ""new"". This is a debate about classification, not about the – to be frank, slightly odd-sounding – refrain about ""hate"" that keeps coming up (for info, you're not doing a very good job of selling anarcho-capitalism). People can assert on WP talk pages that ancap is definitively anarchism, but that is simply not what the record says. Yes, it is sometimes bracketed with it, but there is always nuance or even uncertainty and disagreement on the point, and WP needs to reflect that. Even the Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, mentioned above in favour of the ancap-as-anarchism claim but not actually quoted from, describes it as ""a tendency in the libertarian New Right"", which as it happens is also ""largely confined to the US"" with ""minimal"" influence. Other sources are cited in this section of the ancap page, including Peter Marshall's ''A History of Anarchism'' – described by one newspaper reviewer as ""the most comprehensive account of anarchist thought ever undertaken"" – which has a small chapter on it but concludes that ""few anarchists"" would accept anarcho-capitalists as anarchists and that they might ""best be called right-wing libertartians rather than anarchists"". Even Murray Rothbard himself is quoted in that section disavowing the anarchist label, saying, per this piece: ""We must therefore conclude that we are ''not'' anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical"". Also, @FreeKnowledgeCreator, the point of the proposal or compromise – hence why I described it in those terms – was not to remove it from the template but, as I explicitly said, to retain it but move it. '''''' '''/'''

<user_id=Knight of BAAWA>
Yes, we get into No True Scotsman if we kick out the ""unpopular"". The decision was made long ago to embrace all the forms of anarchismand that is a decision I agree with. Wikipedia isn't about popularity; it's about verifiability, facts, and vetted sources. -

<user_id=Knight of BAAWA>
Rather it is those who hate anarchocapitalism who are emotionally invested; I'm simply trying to help keep them from editing in bad faith and marginalizing a valid school of anarchism. -

<user_id=Eduen>
I have been editing anarchism related articles for some years now and i don´t know what decision to ""embraces all forms of anarchism"" user Knight of BAAWA is talking about. It seems from what i read here that there is no consensus to keep anarchocapitalism in the schools of thought section of this template. I already gave my reasons before for not incluiding that thing here.

<user_id=Knight of BAAWA>
So you never saw this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Anarchism_sidebar/Archive_1#anarcho-capitalism ? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm? Couldn't be bothered to check the archives? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm? And that's just ONE example, Eduen. Just one example. All one has to do is check the archives for this page and the main anarchism page. Like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anarchism/Archive_51#anarcho-capitalism . Seriously: you couldn't be bothered to check the archives? Really? -

No, they actually don't. -

",1,"The discussion revolves around whether anarcho-capitalism should be included as a confirmed school of thought in the anarchism template on Wikipedia. The participants present various arguments, referencing sources, historical decisions on Wikipedia, and the principles of classification.

1. **Argument about classification and sources**: The argument begins with a proposal to move anarcho-capitalism to the ""related topics"" section, with the rationale that it is not widely recognized as a legitimate branch of anarchism by sources outside its adherents. This is a strong argument because it relies on the importance of external validation in classification.

2. **Argument about verifiability and facts**: One user argues that Wikipedia is about verifiability and facts, suggesting that anarcho-capitalism should be included if it meets these criteria. This is a valid point, emphasizing Wikipedia's core principles.

3. **Argument about consensus and historical decisions**: Another user references past discussions and decisions to include all forms of anarchism, implying that there was a consensus to include anarcho-capitalism. However, this argument is weakened by another user pointing out that the cited archives do not support this claim.

4. **Argument about emotional investment and bias**: One user accuses another of having an emotional investment, which could lead to biased editing. This is a weaker argument as it attacks the person rather than addressing the substance of the debate.

5. **Argument about the No True Scotsman fallacy**: The argument that excluding anarcho-capitalism would be akin to the No True Scotsman fallacy is presented. This is a weaker argument because it does not engage with the specific criteria for inclusion in the category of anarchism.

6. **Argument about the relevance of anarcho-capitalism**: Some users argue that anarcho-capitalism is relevant and should be included, while others argue that it is fundamentally different from other forms of anarchism. This is a central point of contention and is argued with varying degrees of effectiveness, with some participants providing more evidence and sources than others.

Overall, the discussion quality is mixed. Some participants provide well-sourced arguments and engage with the principles of Wikipedia editing, while others rely on less effective rhetorical strategies or fail to substantiate their claims. The discussion could benefit from a more structured approach to evaluating sources and a clearer definition of what constitutes a ""school of thought"" within anarchism.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Onceinawhile>
Sentences on the Levant

<user_id=Onceinawhile>
the sentences you added back do not refer to the Southern Levant, but to the Levant itself. They are already in that article and add nothing here except confusion. Can you please either edit the sentences to make them relevant to this article, or else remove them.

<user_id=Onceinawhile>
Also, removing citation needed tags without adding citations is pure disruptive behaviour. Your crusade to support the use of this term has begun to reach into the depths of dishonesty.

<user_id=Drsmoo>
Incorrect, both sources refer directly to the Southern Levant. The fact that you so casually remove sources, when even a cursory glance would have shown their direct relevance to the subject and applicability, is extremely troubling. I advise you to cease personal attacks as well.

<user_id=Laurel Lodged>
It seems very strange that one would want to delete sources supporting a position that CN is no longer needed.

<user_id=Onceinawhile>
The sources may, but not in a way that was relevant to the sentences they were being used to support.

<user_id=Drsmoo>
You should actually read the sources before making hostile/aggressive edits and personal attacks. The ""strictly geographical"" source is referring specifically to the term Southern Levant. The ""cultural corpus"" source is referring to Southern Levant as well as the Levant as a whole. If you had spent half the time reading the sources as you had removing them and making personal attacks there  wouldn't be an issue.

<user_id=Onceinawhile>
If this is right I am willing to accept fault. But on the other hand if that's right, then you should have fixed it instead of blindly and aggressively reverting. There is still no source for the first sentence, the second needs proper linking, and the third sentence is inaccurate and needs amending.

<user_id=Onceinawhile>
And the equivalent sentence at Levant will need editing too. You can't have it mean one thing here and another there.

<user_id=Drsmoo>
Your personal attacks alleging ""blindly and aggressively reverting"" are incorrect. The sentences are all correctly cited. Additionally, your use of ""you"" is incorrect. This is not about you vs me.

<user_id=Onceinawhile>
Ok let's both try to depersonalize this.
Do you intend to fix the problems identified? Or do you want me to?

<user_id=Drsmoo>
There aren't any problems. You erroneously removed sources from the article and then added tags as if the sources didn't exist. I restored the sources and removed the incorrect tags. I also moved the source for ""strictly geographical"" to directly follow the relevant sentence (previously it was following the section as a whole) but that's a cosmetic change.

<user_id=Onceinawhile>
Points 1 and 3 above remain unresolved. Do you have a solution here? And point 2 needs a fix - the sentence says ""authors"", yet we only have one (who also calls the phrase ""awkward"").

<user_id=Onceinawhile>
Specifically:
Today, the term Southern Levant"" is primarily found in the fields of archaeology and history"" => citation needed
The term has been used by authors wishing to present a strictly geographical description => citation needed
Scholars have adopted the term Levant to identify the region due to it being a wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus"" that does not have the ""political overtones"" of Syria-Palestine,[2][3]"" => why are we talking about the Levant, with a sentence copied from that article? Applying it here brings a clear SYNTH implication.

<user_id=Drsmoo>
Laurel Lodged and I seem to be in agreement that there is no issue here aside from your edits.

<user_id=Onceinawhile>
Don't try to sully other people with your own bad judgements. So you are willing to leave 1. an unsourced statement, 2. an inaccurate statement extrapolating from a single author and leaving out a relevant negative comment, and 3. a sentence relevant only to another article left here as Synth? These are blatant violations of wikipedia's principles.

<user_id=Drsmoo>
Read the source. Since you are unwilling or unable to cease personal attacks, I'll be reporting you.

<user_id=Drsmoo>
Late edit, just wanted to point out the humor in someone who for over a year has been trying to personalize edits on wikipedia (with personal attacks, starting attacks by pinging only one editor rather than addressing the articles editors as a whole) calling to then ""depersonalize"" only to then immediately resume personal attacks.
Just wanted to point out the humor in the immediate resumption of personal attacks after calling to depersonalize (which occurred after pinging me, rather than addressing the page's edits as a whole.) As ""personal"" and uncivil as I've seen from any wikipedia editor, ever.

<user_id=Onceinawhile>
, I am not going to respond in kind to this. If you would like to move on and try to rebuild some semblance of a working relationship between us, then I would be very pleased to do so. If we could find a way to stop fighting, I suspect we could work well together.

<user_id=Drsmoo>
There's no issue with calling out incivility and personal attacks. Editing should be directed towards the community as a whole, and work to engage outside editors when possible. Constantly directing agressive remarks and demands at a single editor, while making personal attacks is disruptive. As is opening up several simultaneous talk page discussions on the same point.

<user_id=Onceinawhile>
, playing to the gallery is not going to help us work together.

<user_id=Onceinawhile>
If you want to try to rebuild a working relationship, I am ready.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Relevance of Sources: The discussion begins with a disagreement over the relevance of sources to the article in question. User Onceinawhile argues that the sentences added back do not refer specifically to the Southern Levant and are causing confusion. User Drsmoo counters by stating that the sources do indeed refer to the Southern Levant. This indicates a fundamental disagreement on the interpretation of sources, which is a common issue in Wikipedia discussions.

2. Removal of Citation Needed Tags: User Onceinawhile criticizes the removal of citation needed tags without adding citations, suggesting it is disruptive behavior. User Drsmoo defends the action by stating that the sources are relevant and that the tags were incorrectly placed. This shows a difference in opinion on the necessity of citations for the given content.

3. Personal Attacks and Civility: The discussion includes accusations of personal attacks and aggressive behavior, which detracts from the quality of the argumentation. Both users accuse each other of such behavior, which indicates a breakdown in civil discourse.

4. Focus on Content vs. Individuals: There is a recurring theme where the focus shifts from the content of the article to the behavior of the individuals involved. This is not conducive to a productive discussion about the article's content.

5. Willingness to Collaborate: Despite the heated exchange, User Onceinawhile expresses a willingness to rebuild a working relationship and stop fighting, which is a positive step towards resolving the dispute.

6. Engagement with the Community: User Drsmoo emphasizes the importance of directing editing towards the community as a whole and engaging outside editors, which is a valid point in the context of Wikipedia's collaborative editing model.

Overall, the discussion shows some understanding of Wikipedia's principles and a desire to adhere to factual accuracy and source relevance. However, the quality of the argumentation is marred by personal attacks, a lack of civility, and a focus on individual behavior rather than content. There are attempts to resolve the dispute and a willingness to collaborate, which are positive aspects of the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 4.5",4.5
"<user_id=Dontmakemetypepasswordagain>
New section on criticism of the deal in its aftermath

<user_id=Dontmakemetypepasswordagain>
I added a section of criticisms regarding the deal and its alleged ill effects.  I tried to keep it pretty dry and impeccably sourced.  Please have a look.

<user_id=Dontmakemetypepasswordagain>
I noticed that you added an NPOV tag to this section, complaining in the edit summary about it being a ""pile"" of ""garbage"" or ""rot"", and also complaining (in non-displaying template text) that the section contains ""disreputable fringe views"".
I'll set aside the question of whether referring to notable views by high-quality sources in high-quality publications as ""garbage""—and complaining that another editor has had the nerve to ''actually cite'' them—fosters a collegial editing atmosphere.

<user_id=Dontmakemetypepasswordagain>
That having been set aside, the tag is plainly incorrect, and since you have dispensed with the usualy ''formality'' of attempting to substantiate the tag, I have dispensed with the formality of asking you to identify your complaints, and I just went ahead and removed the tag.  Please go read WP:FRINGE and do not restore the tag without an explanation of what the heck you're talking about.

<user_id=NPguy>
I've removed a few bits that are either outrageous (the genocide claim) or irrelevant (the patrol boat story).  But it's still unbalanced both for the lack of favorable commentary and for the lack of rebuttals to the cited criticisms.

<user_id=Neutrality>
Thanks. I fully agree with all of your removals and also agree that more work needs to be done to balance things out.

<user_id=Neutrality>
I am restoring the tag that NPguy added. I cannot speak for NPguy, but there are major concerns here about the section that you added:
The patrol boat content is not relevant, and is in any case excessive. This incident literally has nothing to do with the JCPOA. Content on it belongs at 2016 U.S.–Iran naval incident, not here.  The incident is probably worthy of a sentence under ""continued tensions,"" but no more.
The section is far too long - undue weight accorded to post-agreement criticism. It mainly recapitulates the sections on political criticism in the United States.
Strays from the article topic by going into detail (complete with lengthy quotes) about Iranian missiles. I am fine with including well-sourced criticism to the effect that missile controls should have been included in the JCPOA, but lengthy expositions on the missiles are simply irrelevant to the JCPOA.
Section is unbalanced - it is loaded up with paragraphs and paragraphs of material criticizing the agreement, yet no equivalent material that notes the agreement's successful implementation.
Because of these serious issues, I am restoring the tag. Do not remove it until the issues are worked out here. , can you weigh in here, particularly on the patrol-boat content?

<user_id=Dontmakemetypepasswordagain>
Please do not edit dishonestly.  You have already been set straight on the Beres-""fringe"" argument and there are simply no two ways about it.  Your ""fringe"" argument is silly and wrong, being contradicted by both the clear words and the plain underlying meaning of the policy itself, as well as the illustrative examples provided.  '''STOP.'''
You're also arguing that criticisms by the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee aren't entitled to ''any'' weight at all.  A silly claim, made with zero basis.  Also in connection with this improper removal: ''Huffington Post'' is cited extensively throughout this article.  That being the case, you will not remove commentary from such important figures based on further BS claims about ''Breitbart'' not being ""reliable"" to provide a ''transcript of quoted remarks''.
The patrol boat incident was relevant.  The relevance is stated in various sources, and not just the ones I cited.  The relevance is also ''obvious''.  You don't get to contradict sources simply because you want to ''pretend'' that relevant things ""aren't relevant"", and because the guiding principle of the JCPOA itself is for US negotiators to be stupidly blind to Iranian duplicity and pretend it has no bearing on the deal.  That idiotic fake reality is binding on Obama's negotiating team, but is not binding on the real world, the press, etc.; and it is not authoritative for Wikipedia articles, whereas RS commentaries ''are''.

<user_id=Dontmakemetypepasswordagain>
Please also note there is no WP policy whatsoever that recommends that important and well-sourced commentary be censored or otherwise excluded ''simply because you can't find a published rebuttal''.  If there are rebuttals, add them.  If there are no rebuttals, '''tough—the unrebutted criticisms remain in the article'''.  Nor is the section a ""recapitulation"" of other criticisms—by and large it pertains to Iran's increased provocation ''after and as a result of'' the deal.

<user_id=Dontmakemetypepasswordagain>
You're ''also'' arguing that criticisms by '''the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency''' aren't fit for inclusion because the publication they appeared in was ''The New York Post''.  This is just dumb, and I can't think of more obvious evidence that you are engaging in '''gamesmanship''' here.

<user_id=NPguy>
See previous discussion about the genocide claim, which is deliberately inflammatory and cannot be taken seriously.  It is a fringe view.

<user_id=Dontmakemetypepasswordagain>
You are fully delusional and should be blocked for bad-faith editing.  You know that the policy does not support that edit and you have had it explained to you in clear terms.  Reverted.

<user_id=Joshua Issac>
The patrol boat incident is irrelevant to criticism of the nuclear deal because although many sources (''The Telegraph'', ''Business Insider'', etc.) have written about it in conjunction with the deal, it has nothing to do with criticism, so it belongs elsewhere in the article. The ballistic missile test is relevant because sources have commented on whether it should have been covered under the deal, but and Israel's response to it is not (unless you can find a source that says Israel specifically mentioned the deal in relation to the test). I suggest you take a look at WP:SYN to help you determine what is relevant and what is not. And if you find someone, say, Shahi Hamid, opining that ""JCPOA is bad"", that does not belong in the article, because he is not notable, but if he writes ""Secretary of State Jane Doe says the JCPOA is bad"", then it belongs here because Jane Doe's opinion is notable in relation to foreign policy. Also, it is not helpful to insult editors (WP:CIVIL) or to divert the discussion topic (""That idiotic fake reality is binding on Obama's negotiating team"", etc.; this page is for discussing the article's content and sources, not for discussing whether the nuclear deal is good or bad; see WP:TALK#USE).

<user_id=Neutrality>
I agree with NPguy and with Joshua, above, that you should be civil (and not to accuse others, like NPGuy, of ""bad faith"" editing). I would also caution you against re-adding this material (i.e., the long, meandering extract at the patrol-boat incident), because there is a firm consensus on this talk page (at least 3-1) against including it.:
The ''NY Post'' material is also problematic, and you've been informed of this. The ''Post'' is a lousy tabloid, and ought not to be used, particularly on complex and important subjects.

<user_id=Yagasi>
It is a lost cause. You will not find even 3 righteous Wikipedians to break the consensus established by NPGuy and Neutrality.

<user_id=Joshua Issac>
I have renamed the section previously named ''New sanctions'' to ''Continued tensions'', and moved the material on the ballistic missile tests there. I have also removed some of the claims that were in violation of WP:SYN (like ""Iranian state press later boasted that..."") and reworded some content to remove charged language taken from opinion pieces, so that it does not present the commentators' views as fact.

<user_id=NPguy>
I am one of three editors who disagree with your edits.  You are clearly editing against consensus.  I did keep one piece, quoting Heinonen.  The claim in the National Review is opinion and factually incorrect.

<user_id=Dontmakemetypepasswordagain>
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask for a little more discussion than that.  Please state what needs to be removed, and why.  If something needs to be shortened, please state why.  If some opinion is mistakenly being presented as fact, please show where.  If something being presented as fact is incorrect, please show where. Please be a little more cooperative here.

<user_id=Dontmakemetypepasswordagain>
I'm not going to further address the silly claim about a legal expert's opinion in an RS being ""fringe"".  Just stop, NPGuy.  Moving along, the missile launches and patrol boat incident were both explicitly connected to the nuclear deal in the source material, in one case by Pres. Obama, and in the WP prose, and I have also adjusted the WP prose to make that more clear. I restored the remarks by the IAEA chief and former deputy chief, using a Harvard Kennedy School of Government article portal and a ''National Review'' piece, although I think it is silly to exclude quoted remarks from major expert figures simply because you dislike the newspaper.  I restored the Robbins quotes, which were not at any time presented as fact, or as anything other than the quoted statements of Robbins, so I found that to be a puzzling accusation, but in any event I added some more textual attributions to shore it up a bit.  Aaaand last but not least NPGuy hasn't called my edits ""garbage"" or ""rot"" in the last 24 hours so I agree to be more civil just like him! Ok folks, I'll see you soon.

<user_id=GabeIglesia>

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. The initial argument presented by <user_id=Dontmakemetypepasswordagain> is that they have added a section with criticisms of a deal, which they claim is well-sourced and neutral in tone. They defend the relevance and sourcing of their additions when challenged.

2. <user_id=NPguy> and <user_id=Neutrality> raise concerns about the balance and relevance of the added content. They argue that the section is unbalanced, giving undue weight to criticism, and includes irrelevant information, such as the patrol boat incident, which they claim is not directly related to the deal.

3. <user_id=Dontmakemetypepasswordagain> responds defensively, insisting on the relevance of their content and accusing others of bad-faith editing. They also challenge the reliability judgment of certain sources and the exclusion of certain viewpoints.

4. <user_id=Joshua Issac> provides a more structured critique, focusing on the relevance of the content to the article's subject and the importance of not presenting opinions as facts. They also remind everyone to adhere to Wikipedia's civility guidelines.

5. <user_id=Neutrality> reinforces the call for civility and consensus, pointing out that there is a majority agreement against including certain content. They also question the reliability of the New York Post as a source.

6. <user_id=Yagasi> expresses a sense of futility in the discussion, suggesting that a consensus has already been established by other editors.

7. <user_id=GabeIglesia> takes the initiative to bring the matter to the attention of the admin noticeboard, indicating that the discussion may be veering into an edit war and that the dialogue has not been productive.

The quality of the arguments varies among the participants. Some editors, like <user_id=NPguy>, <user_id=Neutrality>, and <user_id=Joshua Issac>, provide clear, policy-based reasoning for their positions, focusing on Wikipedia's guidelines for neutrality, relevance, and source reliability. On the other hand, <user_id=Dontmakemetypepasswordagain> presents a less structured argument, often resorting to defensive language and accusations of bad faith, which detracts from the quality of the discussion.

Overall, the discussion includes some well-reasoned arguments that are based on Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, but it is also marred by incivility and a lack of consensus-building. The presence of strong emotions and personal attacks lowers the overall quality of the dialogue.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Westheimer

<user_id=DissidentAggressor>
Looks like vandalism. That whole section needs sources, people.

<user_id=Dhtwiki>
You're talking about her being added to faculty? That happened here, where Ruth Westheimer was one of two additions, the first, corrected to Bonanno in the next edit, seems legitimate. Perhaps the editor was confused, rather than vandalistic. As far as needing sources, I assume the the linked pages will suffice to give bona fides as to the association with Teacher's College. Westheimer has been listed amongst alumni since 2007, at least.

<user_id=DissidentAggressor>
Ok, great - It looked like a prank (me being a skeptic).  As far as the sources, this is a common misconception.  Per WP:NLIST, ''""every entry in any such list requires a reliable source attesting to the fact that the named person is a member of the listed group.""''  So, no the linked pages do not suffice.

<user_id=Dhtwiki>
WP:NLIST doesn't say that the source has to be found on this page (very few lists that I've seen are well sourced directly). All the names on the faculty list have their own articles, and thus are notable. Whether their association with the college is documented there is another matter. If it's not and can be, then that source should be added to their main article page. If it can't be then the name probably should be struck here.

<user_id=DissidentAggressor>
NLIST sez Every entry must have a reliable source '''attesting to the fact that the person is a member of the list.''' It can't be clearer than that.   Their articles may or may not attest to that membership - that's why that statement is in NLIST. The WP:BURDEN is on the person that adds information to any article to support it.  BURDEN goes on to say any material lacking '''a reliable source directly supporting it''' may be removed and should not be restored without an inline citation to a reliable source.   This is a fundamental tenet of WP:V.
I agree that there is a lot of unsourced stuff throughout the project but the fact that Wikipedia is filled with crap is not relevant.

<user_id=Dhtwiki>
OK, but I think that the source you found, if it isn't already at Westheimer's page (assuming that's not where you found it) should be there, as well as here, or you're going to have a very fragmented encyclopedia, with tidbits scattered throughout. And unsourced information isn't automatically ""crap"" as has just been shown. Where you though vandalism, and I thought confusion, it turned out that the addition of Westheimer to the faculty list was appropriate.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The initial concern raised by <user_id=DissidentAggressor> is about potential vandalism on a Wikipedia page, specifically regarding the addition of Ruth Westheimer to a faculty list. This shows a commitment to the accuracy and integrity of the content, which is a positive aspect of the discussion.

2. <user_id=Dhtwiki> responds by providing context and suggesting that the edit might not be vandalism but rather a confusion. This user also points out that Westheimer has been listed as an alumnus since 2007, which adds historical context to the discussion.

3. <user_id=DissidentAggressor> then clarifies the need for reliable sources as per Wikipedia's guidelines (WP:NLIST), emphasizing that each entry in a list requires a source attesting to the person's membership in the group. This is a strong argument that aligns with Wikipedia's verifiability policy.

4. <user_id=Dhtwiki> counters by discussing the common practice of sourcing on Wikipedia and the notability of individuals with their own articles. This user suggests that if the association with the college is documented in the individual's main article, it should suffice.

5. <user_id=DissidentAggressor> reiterates the importance of direct sourcing for each entry on the list, referencing Wikipedia's burden of evidence policy (WP:BURDEN). This argument is grounded in Wikipedia's core content policies and is a strong point in favor of ensuring all content is verifiable.

6. <user_id=Dhtwiki> acknowledges the need for sources but also advocates for a practical approach to avoid fragmentation of information across Wikipedia. This user also points out that the absence of a source does not automatically render information as ""crap,"" which is a valid point considering that the information may still be accurate but not yet sourced.

Overall, both users present arguments that are grounded in Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. <user_id=DissidentAggressor> focuses on strict adherence to sourcing requirements, while <user_id=Dhtwiki> emphasizes the practical aspects of editing and maintaining an encyclopedia. The discussion is civil, focused on policy, and both users contribute constructively to the resolution of the issue.

Please stop reverting edits without discussion on the talk page

<user_id=Diffeomorphicvoodoo>
The entries from the article were removed with good reason. The sources provided do not support the claim being made in the article for most entries currently in the article. Removing unverifiable claims is not overzealous deletion WP:ZEAL. The entries can be added again as sources are found for them. I have already started this process and added an entry with a source in an edit. Reverting to older edits is just undoing all this work.

<user_id=ChunnuBhai>
This is a new article, 3 days old as of now, and author may need time to add reliable sources. the wikipedia community can pitch in too. However, if most of the entries are deleted, the wikipedia community may not be able to pitch in. Its one thing to delete blatantly false information, and completely another to delete potentially true information just for the want of WP:RS/. in the latter case, ""citation needed"" tag may be placed instead of deleting some material altogether.

<user_id=Razer2115>
This page falls in the borderline category of WP:HOAX and WP:ATTACK and with the influx of new editors, It is clear that this page is mentioned in some kind of forum or talk board. Please get consensus here on this talk page before reverting any more edits.

<user_id=ChunnuBhai>
, you have been deleting and reverting the edits too. Please desist from deleting material from a new wikipedia article. Wikipedia allows new authors the courtesy to have time to add reliable links to support the article. Lets us not pounce upon a new article. I disagree that this is WP:HOAX or WP:ATTACK. renaming schemes happen all the time, it is never a hoax. whether or not a separate page is warranted, is being discussed on AFD page. any propaganda material may be removed as per wiki.

<user_id=Diffeomorphicvoodoo>
How do we know whether a claim is ""potentially true information"" in the absence of verifiable sources? I went through the sources mentioned in the article and for more than half of the entries, the source does not support the claim being made at all. Why should potentially false claims be retained on a wikipedia page, especially one that is generating a lot of pageviews?

<user_id=Diffeomorphicvoodoo>
You have again reverted the article, despite the ongoing discussion on the talk page. This is you third revert on this article. This is simply not acceptable.

<user_id=ChunnuBhai>
Wikipedia assumes good faith on the part of authors, unless explicitly displayed. Absence of RS does not automatically imply false information. A new author as well as wikipedia community should be given time to verify the material in the article. Deletion of information must be based on falsifiability of information. current information is verifiable as well as falsifiable. if the information is demonstrated to be false, it should be deleted. Absence of RS in the initial stages of the article should not be a reason to edit-warring like behaviour while succumbing to WP:ZEAL. Page views have nothing to do with reliability of the article.

<user_id=ChunnuBhai>
I reverted the article to the point where information started to be deleted by various editors. Lets us give time to the author to post RS. In the meantime, you may please tag the entries with citation needed tag instead of outrightly deleting them.

<user_id=Chirag>
Added half a dozen sources. There is no original research in this article, just citations. Not sure why this claim has been made

<user_id=Diffeomorphicvoodoo>
That's because in more than half of the entries, the source does not directly support the claim being made. In many cases, the ""source"" is simply a link to an announcement or an evaluation of the old scheme, with no mention of the new scheme at all. The natural conclusion is that the author has compared the old scheme with the new one and it is his own claim that the old one has been renamed, which is original research.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Diffeomorphicvoodoo argues for the removal of unverified claims from the article, emphasizing the importance of verifiability and adherence to Wikipedia's guidelines on reliable sourcing (WP:RS). They also mention that they have begun the process of adding entries with sources, which shows a constructive approach to improving the article's quality.

2. User ChunnuBhai counters by suggesting that new articles should be given some leeway to allow authors time to add reliable sources. They propose using ""citation needed"" tags instead of outright deletion, which is a common practice on Wikipedia to indicate that a particular claim needs a reliable source.

3. User Razer2115 raises concerns about the article potentially falling under WP:HOAX or WP:ATTACK and mentions the influx of new editors, which could indicate coordinated editing from an external forum. This is a valid concern as it touches upon the integrity of the editing process and the potential for bias or misinformation.

4. User Diffeomorphicvoodoo questions the retention of potentially false claims and the criteria for determining what is ""potentially true information"" without sources. This is a strong argument for maintaining the integrity of Wikipedia's content and ensuring that information is verifiable.

5. User ChunnuBhai reiterates the principle of assuming good faith and argues that the absence of reliable sources does not automatically imply false information. They also mention that the information is verifiable and falsifiable, suggesting that it should be given a chance to be verified before deletion.

6. User Chirag claims that there is no original research in the article and that it contains just citations. However, this statement is challenged by User Diffeomorphicvoodoo, who points out that the sources provided do not directly support the claims being made, which would constitute original research.

Overall, the discussion shows a mix of adherence to Wikipedia's guidelines, with some users emphasizing the importance of verifiability and others advocating for a more lenient approach to new articles. The arguments presented are generally coherent and relevant to Wikipedia's content policies, although there is a disagreement on the application of these policies.

"<user_id=Histrange>
Joe Karam

<user_id=Histrange>
In this article in the NZ Herald, Karam's inner voice defines the man, the author interviewed Karam and wrote: ''""The same doggedness, the same sceptical attitude towards authority, characterise the fight, which he says is far from over, to prove the innocence of convicted murderer David Bain.""''

<user_id=Histrange>
The fact that Karam thought David was innocent is so well documented, it should not need to be discussed on this page. The deleted words should be reinstated.

<user_id=Akld guy>
You do not know what Karam believes. He might have believed, and might still believe, that Bain is guilty but deserved to be found innocent because a miscarriage of justice occurred. In a case where you believe a miscarriage of justice has occurred, you can only press for a not guilty verdict. You cannot argue your case while saying ""I want him to be found innocent because a miscarriage of justice occurred, but I believe he's guilty."" That would be a crazy tactic. So defence attorneys always have to proceed with their public face proclaiming ""This person is innocent"", even when they know that is not the case. If you can find a quote of Karam saying that he believes DB is innocent, maybe we can re-insert it.

<user_id=Histrange>
I have done much better than find a quote. I found a whole book Karam wrote called '''''Innocent!: seven critical flaws in the conviction of David Bain'''.  ''  ''

<user_id=Akld guy>
The fact that a book title uses the word innocent does not mean the author believes the person to be innocent. As I said above, the defence has one option and one option only: claim innocence in order to establish that a miscarriage of justice occurred, despite what members of the defence might actually believe.

<user_id=Histrange>
You said I ""do not know what Karam believes."" Neither do you. You asked me to provide a quote. I did. I provided four books by Karam including one where he says Bain is innocent in the title. The fact that the book, including the title, was written by Karam and uses the word 'innocent' clearly means that Karam believes David to be innocent. To argue otherwise is churlish.
It is not the role of editors on Wikipedia to take what people have said and place their own interpretation on it - which is what you are doing. Wikipedia simply reports what people have done and said (using reliable sources). Joe Karam has clearly said that David is innocent and I have provided an extremely reliable source - his own book. This is what you asked me to do and that's what I have done. I think you need to let this go.

<user_id=Akld guy>
I have not in any way said that Karam believes, or believed, that DB was guilty. I have illustrated how defence attorneys are obliged to present a not guilty or innocent stance because that is the only option available to them. Nobody knows what Karam believed when he took up the case, which is the point where you want to add the words ""who believed that David was innocent."" If you can find a quote from that time period (circa 1996, when Karam first got involved) saying that he believed Bain innocent, those words can be added. Now, a person can change their mind in 20 years. What Karam believed then, may not be what he believed in 2001 or 2007 or today. The onus is on '''you''' to find a reference from '''circa 1996''' saying what Karam believed. Not from 2007, not from 2009, not from yesterday.

<user_id=Histrange>
Your argument about defence attorneys is irrelevant. Joe Karam is not an attorney. ''Innocent!: seven critical flaws in the conviction of David Bain'' was published in 2001. What difference does it make when he came to believe it? But if you are going to be so picky we can change the words to ''""who came to believe that David was innocent.""'' Would that satisfy you?

<user_id=Akld guy>
Joe Karam is by far the most prolific speaker on behalf of the Bain defence team, and it's nit-picking to claim that my illustration of an attorney's stance does not apply to him because he wasn't an attorney. Your suggestion means that the Lead would read ""''Bain's case was taken up by businessman and former All Black, Joe Karam, who came to believe that David was innocent.""'' You are going to need a compelling quote from Karam himself at some time that that is what he believed. Quoting from the titles of books is not good enough, for the reasons I have already stated, and is in fact WP:SYNTHESIS (drawing a conclusion based on your opinion of what may be implied by the titles).

<user_id=Melcous>
I was asked to comment on this discussion by  I would say that these words do not belong in the lead. At the end of the day, they are a statement about someone's opinion/beliefs/state of mind, which we can't assume or extrapolate, regardless of how likely it is due to their actions that they hold this view. Therefore if this statement was to be included at all, it would need a reliable source actually stating that that view was held by that person at that time. And therefore, even there was such a source, and then consensus to include that statement, I'd still suggest it would belong in the body of the article, rather than in the lead. Cheers,

<user_id=Histrange>
The title of the book is '''''Innocent!: seven critical flaws in the conviction of David Bain''.''' The word ''''innocent'''' in the title comes straight from the horse's mouth - ie Karam's. If you quote someone else claiming what Karam said, such a source would clearly be less reliable than what Karam said himself. Therefore there is no assumption or extrapolation involved in quoting Karam's own book title.

<user_id=Histrange>
Here is a quote from someone who reviewed Joe Karam's first book, ''David and Goliath: The Bain Family Murders'' published in 1997: ""A good book for anyone interested in the David Bain case. Though I didn't agree in the slightest with '''Karam's conclusions that it is certain that Bain is innocent'''.""

<user_id=Histrange>
Here's another source who thinks David Bain is Guilty. He says: ""Lets go to the heart of '''Joe Karam's assertion that Bain is innocent""'''. What more do you need?

<user_id=Histrange>
Since no one  disagreed with my last points, it appears you now accept that Karam's books are a reliable source on what Karam thinks or believes (which seems totally obvious). I will give it another few days before restoring the wording that has been in dispute into the article, but ''""if you disagree, the onus is on you to say so"".'' See WP:Silence.

<user_id=Akld guy>
If you restore the wording, you will be going against consensus and will be edit warring. You have been given the valid reason that nobody knows what Karam believed or now believes. Even though book titles and reviewers' comments seem to indicate that he held a particular view, nobody knows whether he believed DB was innocent, or whether he sought to right a miscarriage of justice and on that basis alone was obliged to press for a not guilty verdict. You have already been told that, and your quoting of WP:Silence is misguided, since we are not obliged to argue with you on the same points over and over again.

<user_id=Histrange>
You have not given a valid reason. Everyone knows what Karam believes - and I have provided numerous sources proving what he believes. You have been told that over and over again but for some reason, you seem to be unable to accept it. You seem to have a problem following the wikipedia rules about reliable sources - which makes you the one who is edit warring.

<user_id=Melcous>
As  has said, this is not a case of WP:Silence. You have asked for opinions, we have given them, and thus there is consensus not to include the additional wording. We understand your reasons, we just do not think they are valid. Continuing to repeat them with additional sources (which, by the way, as a blog and a review both fail WP:UGC) does not change that. Please leave it be.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Histrange argues that Joe Karam believes David Bain is innocent and that this should be reflected in the Wikipedia article. They cite Karam's book titles, specifically ""Innocent!: seven critical flaws in the conviction of David Bain,"" as evidence of Karam's belief in Bain's innocence.

2. User Akld guy counters that the title of a book does not necessarily reflect the personal belief of the author, especially in legal defense contexts where the strategy is to assert innocence as part of the defense, regardless of personal belief.

3. User Histrange provides additional sources, including a book review and a quote from a source who believes Bain is guilty, both of which reference Karam's assertion of Bain's innocence.

4. User Akld guy maintains that the actual belief of Karam is not verifiable and that the proposed wording could be misleading. They emphasize the need for a direct quote from Karam from the time he first got involved in the case to accurately reflect his beliefs at that time.

5. User Melcous, asked to comment, suggests that statements about someone's beliefs require a reliable source stating that view and that such a statement, even if sourced, would be more appropriate for the body of the article rather than the lead.

6. User Histrange insists on the reliability of Karam's books as a source for his beliefs and interprets the lack of response as acceptance of their argument, citing WP:Silence.

7. User Akld guy clarifies that silence does not imply consent and reiterates the consensus against including the additional wording.

8. User Melcous confirms that there is a consensus not to include the additional wording and points out that the additional sources provided by Histrange do not meet Wikipedia's guidelines for user-generated content.

Evaluation:

- User Histrange presents a straightforward argument based on the titles of Karam's books and additional sources, assuming that these directly reflect Karam's beliefs.
- User Akld guy presents a nuanced argument about the nature of legal defense and the potential for a discrepancy between public assertions and personal beliefs.
- User Melcous provides a procedural perspective, focusing on Wikipedia's guidelines and the appropriate placement of such information within an article.

The discussion quality is moderate. While User Histrange provides what they believe to be direct evidence of Karam's beliefs, they do not fully address the counterarguments presented by User Akld guy regarding the complexity of legal defense strategies. User Akld guy and User Melcous provide more nuanced arguments that consider Wikipedia's guidelines and the nature of evidence required to assert someone's beliefs. The discussion could be improved with more direct evidence regarding Karam's beliefs at the time he first got involved in the case and a more thorough examination of Wikipedia's policies on verifiability and biographies of living persons.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Rolf h nelson>
Added NPOV tag; could use rewrite

<user_id=Rolf h nelson>
I have to admit this edit summary  justifying why we should say it's been published in ""journals"" (plural), even though it's only been published in one journal, made me smile. Any volunteers to rewrite this article? Note that, if time is an issue, ""Deleting every single statement that doesn't have an inline cite with solid WP:WEIGHT"" is a perfectly valid way to conduct a rewrite for an article such as this.

<user_id=Insertcleverphrasehere>
If you'd like to improve the wording of the sentence instead of complaining about it... that would be helpful, it certainly isn't a case of 'citation needed' as your edit indicated, also, the second part of your edit was very POV-pushy as it is clear that no consensus has been reached on the RFRCT.

<user_id=Insertcleverphrasehere>
''''""Deleting every single statement that doesn't have an inline cite with solid WP:WEIGHT"" is a perfectly valid way to conduct a rewrite for an article such as this.''''' is actually completely inappropriate. Add citation needed tags in this case, remove information only if it is unnecessary for the reader's understanding or if it is believed that the information may be false and a quick search doesn't back it up. '''Adding''' citations to unsourced material is actually a far better way to edit an article.    

<user_id=Insertcleverphrasehere>
Additionally, could you please explain the reason you think the article is NPOV Without a reason specified I find it difficult to support the NPOV tag.    

<user_id=Rolf h nelson>
Have you read the Wikipedia policies you're citing?

<user_id=Rolf h nelson>
One initial reason for believing the article is NPOV is that this I disagree with the reversion . I believe the scientific consensus is that the anomalous results are extremely likely to be experimental error. In addition, I believe that all weakly-cited information should be removed; an initial removal of things that are obviously weakly cited and controversial would be a helpful first step.

<user_id=Insertcleverphrasehere>
We have been through this before you know... have a read through previous discussions. If the consensus was that the results were experimental error there would be 1: an explanation of how the errors came about (there so far is not), and 2: there would not be a significant number of high profile researchers currently investigating the phenomenon to understand how the results came about. Now I'm not saying that the thing works, far from it, but no one is sure what is causing the thrust readings (error or otherwise), until someone confirms what has been causing the errors/trust there is no 'consensus' whatsoever. Scientists don't just guess, neither do we.    

<user_id=Mfb>
Significant number... the not significant excess seen by two LHC experiments recently triggered ~200 theory preprints (and I'm sure many of them will become peer-reviewed papers in the future) from even more authors in less than two months. It got far more attention in the scientific community than this topic, although the experimental claims are much weaker and the implication of an actual result would be much weaker as well (a new elementary particle vs. a complete breakdown of a fundamental principle of all modern theories in physics). So (2) is not the case. (1) is not necessary. If I claim that I measured the rotation of Earth and the result was zero, everyone would agree that I made a mistake - up to the point that most scientists wouldn't even bother to try to spot the errors. That is the situation we have here. It is a bit better than a claim from a single person, but the overwhelming expectation is a measurement error - probably even by those investigating the experiments done by others.

<user_id=Insertcleverphrasehere>
comparing the LHC to fringe science is more than a little disingenuous. While what you said might be true, the sources on the subject are still saying ""we t aren't sure how these results came about"". They aren't saying ""this is obviously bullshit and we are just sitting around wasting grant money"".    

<user_id=Insertcleverphrasehere>
are you saying that a the majority of reliable sources on the subject are saying that it is definitely experimental error? Because from what I've seen that is not the case. they are still looking for an explanation for the anomalous results, error or otherwise.    

<user_id=TenOfAllTrades>
I will note in passing that Insertcleverphrasehere was banned last year from the topic of ""cold fusion, broadly construed"" under the ArbCom's discretionary sanctions relating to pseudoscience: ban discussion.  He was banned for a pattern of tendentious timewasting on talk pages, devoted to credulous over-weighting of fringe sources and opinions.  He shouldl take care not to repeat the same type of conduct.

<user_id=Mfb>
So you agree that this is fringe science? Fine, then what is the point of this discussion. If the majority of physicists wouldn't be convinced of measurement errors there it would not be fringe. ""We are not sure how"" does not exclude ""but it is probably a measurement error somewhere"" - they just don't know where exactly.

<user_id=Mfb>
And the topic ban expires in a week...

<user_id=Insertcleverphrasehere>
Source it and cite it then.    

<user_id=Mfb>
You are the one who wants to keep unsourced claims in the article. You don't need sources for things that are not in the article.

<user_id=TenOfAllTrades>
Yeah, I don't look forward to the attitude above returning to the cold fusion area.

<user_id=202.36.179.107>
Wait... when did I say that??? I simply said that the best way to deal with unsourced material is to look for a source '''before deleting''', rather than deleting without bothering to look, as  recommended. If material can't be backed up then it should obviously be deleted. Also, by saying ""source it and cite it"" I meant if you want to say that ""the consensus is that the results are very likely the result of experimental error"" you can do that just fine it you can find a citation for it.    

<user_id=Rolf h nelson>
No, but I would say that almost all physicists, if asked ""are you confident that this will turn out to be experimental error?"" would review the publications and say ""Yes."" In addition, there are WP:RS saying the theory is nonsense (Egan, Baez, and Popular Mechanics) but no WP:RS saying ""the theory probably is not nonsense.""

<user_id=Insertcleverphrasehere>
True, there are a few vocal detractors such as Baez ... It might be what you say is true, but I can't seem to find a source that says so. It seems that most of the coverage is basically saying to be sceptical and not to believe reports of 'confirmation' because nasa didn't 'confirm' anything. But does this represent '''consensus''' that the results ""are very likely to be due to experimental error""? The Popular mechanics articles basically say to wait and see,  both of them. Even after the initial wave of ""be sceptical, this has not been confirmed"", there were other reports that nasa still hasn't found the causes of the anomolous readings .  Personally this seems to me to represent a consensus that 'more research is needed' to understand what is going on and that scepticism is advised, which is how the article is structured at the moment. However, I'm happy to support your change if you can find a source that agrees that the majority of the community believes that error is the cause.    

<user_id=Rolf h nelson>
If that's your position, I don't understand why you're not in agreement to remove ""peer-reviewed journals"" then from the lede, unless you have a source that agrees that ""it has been published in peer-reviewed journals"" (plural)? Because, you know, it hasn't.

<user_id=Insertcleverphrasehere>
how about something along the lines of ""...and has been published in 'xxxx', a Chinese peer reviewed journal."" Still awkward, but more accurate I suppose.    

<user_id=Rolf h nelson>
That's an improvement. I want to come back to the lede after the rest of the article is fixed, since the lede should reflect the article.

<user_id=Insertcleverphrasehere>
I agree that the article is currently badly formatted. It reads in a very disjoined manner with, for example, multiple sections on the emdrive and cannae drive, I've done a bit of moving stuff around, and expect I'll have a bit more time to do so than previously, (I just submitted my masters thesis last week, so I've been kind of busy).    

<user_id=Rolf h nelson>
section does not belong in the 'history' section as it is simply a collection of claims by the inventor in his patent, belongs in the 'emdirve' section instead. I was totally with you until the comma. If you're going to illogically block its removal, I think the thing to do is to pause my edits and see if someone steps forward within the next month to rewrite. If they don't maybe I'll go ahead and rewrite it myself, using appropriate dispute resolution methods if it's tendetiously blocked.

<user_id=Insertcleverphrasehere>
Well I'm not sure exactly what I'm supposedly 'blocking' or are you just parroting Tenofalltrades? I think it is clear that the section in question is much better suited for the emdrive section than the history section, as it is basically a collection of claims about how it works by the emdrive inventor. I'm having a little difficulty with the fact that nobody here seems to be able to assume good faith. Honestly do whatever the hell you want, I'm done editing this article if this is the kind of thanks I get.    

<user_id=Rolf h nelson>
I've removed the tag since I'm satisfied with the current version.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Use of Wikipedia Policies**: Both parties reference Wikipedia policies such as WP:NPOV (Neutral Point of View) and WP:WEIGHT (giving due weight to viewpoints in proportion to their prominence). This shows an understanding of the framework within which Wikipedia operates, which is a positive aspect of the discussion.

2. **Citation and Verification**: The discussion involves a debate over the need for citations and the removal of unsourced material. One user advocates for the removal of statements without inline citations, while another suggests adding citations to unsourced material. This reflects a concern for the verifiability of information, which is crucial for maintaining the quality of a Wikipedia article.

3. **Consensus and Scientific Standing**: The debate touches on the scientific consensus regarding the subject matter (in this case, a fringe science topic). One user argues that there is no consensus that the results are experimental error, while another insists that the scientific community would likely view them as such. This indicates an awareness of the importance of representing the scientific community's views accurately.

4. **Fringe Science and Mainstream Acceptance**: The discussion acknowledges the distinction between fringe science and mainstream scientific acceptance. This is important for ensuring that the article does not give undue weight to fringe theories.

5. **Personal Conduct and Previous Bans**: The mention of a user's previous ban for tendentious editing introduces a personal conduct element into the discussion. While this is relevant to the credibility of the arguments presented, it also introduces a potential bias against the user's contributions.

6. **Constructive Suggestions**: There are constructive suggestions for improving the article, such as rephrasing sentences for accuracy and restructuring the article for better coherence. This is a positive aspect as it moves the discussion towards actionable improvements.

7. **Assumption of Good Faith**: There is a tension between users regarding the assumption of good faith, which is a core principle of Wikipedia. The breakdown in assuming good faith detracts from the discussion quality as it can lead to unproductive exchanges.

8. **Resolution and Compromise**: The discussion ends with a user removing the NPOV tag, indicating satisfaction with the current version of the article. This suggests that some resolution or compromise was reached, which is a positive outcome.

Overall, the discussion demonstrates a reasonable understanding of Wikipedia policies, a concern for factual accuracy, and a willingness to engage in debate over the content of the article. However, the quality of the discussion is somewhat marred by personal conduct issues and a failure to consistently assume good faith.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Npov

<user_id=PalaceGuard008>
The talks section and subsequent sections need re-writing for NPOV. Right now, parts read like propaganda for the former Chen Shui-bian administration, heaping all blame for non-progress on the other side. In truth, both sides are probably partially responsible, and the article needs to be a lot more nuanced in its approach.

<user_id=Readin>
Taiwan was willing to talk without any pre-conditions.  China insisted that Taiwan first agree to China's point of view before talks started.  In such a situation it is hard to assign blame equally.  The best we can do is simply report the fact that Taiwan was willing to talk without preconditions but China insisted on pre-conditions that were unacceptable to Taiwan.  That's what we report.  if that sounds like we're blaming China I'm sure what we're supposed to do.  We can't change the facts.

<user_id=PalaceGuard008>
The facts were that both sides disagreed on the conditions for the talks, and so no talks were held. If one wants to present one's interpretation of the facts, then both views need to be presented. Either stick clear of interpretation, or present all major points of view.
In any case, the issue has been addressed for now with the removal of the opinionated material.

That Chen had no genuine will to negotiate can be seen from the difference in approach between his administration and the current. The Ma administration also does not agree with the ""one China principle"" as espoused by the PRC, but it is willing to compromise and use the ambiguous 1992 Consensus as a basis on which both sides can commence negotiations.

<user_id=Readin>
Enlighten me.  When did President Chen insist that the PRC publicly repudiate the one-China principle before talks could proceed?  President Chen merely said that Taiwan would not agree to it.  What pre-conditions did President Chen set for the talks?  The ""existing basis for the talks"" was a condition tht the PRC insisted on.  It was not something Taiwan insisted on nor was it something Taiwan insisted that the PRC disavow.
If you say ""Taiwan was willing to talk without preconditions"" misrepresents the truth, and in fact is a statement taken straight out of Chen-era propaganda.', then tell me precisely what preconditions Taiwan wasn't willing to talk without.

<user_id=PalaceGuard008>
Taiwan insisted on the condition that the basis of the talks should not be any version of the ""one China principle"" or ""1992 Consensus"". To describe the situation as ""Taiwan was willing to talk without preconditions"" is misleading, because it creates the impression that Taiwan made no demands. A more accurate phrasing might be ""Taiwan insisted on negotiations without preconditions"", and an even more accurate phrasing might be ""Taiwan insisted that negotiations could not be on the basis of the 1992 consensus"".
In one sense, the bigger problem is ""willing"". When you are insisting on changing the framework of negotiations, you are making demands on the modes of negotiations more than expressing a willingness to negotiate.
Was it really ""not something Taiwan insisted on nor was it something Taiwan insisted that the PRC disavow""?
I don't think then-President Chen was so naive. He knew when he insisted that negotiations be ""unconditional"", that the mainland government could not agree to that due to domestic political pressure. If the mainland government was to accept his purported ""invitation"", it would amount to tacit endorsement of his repudiation of the 1992 consensus, and backtracking on its own stated and consistent position. Public opinion would not have swallowed it in China, and Chen knew this. My personal view remains that it was not a genuine proposal, but merely political posturing for domestic point-scoring.

<user_id=PalaceGuard008>
The existing basis of the talks was a matter of agreement between the previous administration in Taiwan and the mainland government. It was, in fact, a compromise that represented the intersection of the demands of each. The 1992 consensus was not something ""imposed"" by the mainland government on Taiwan.

",0,"The discussion between the users PalaceGuard008 and Readin revolves around the neutrality of a section in an article, specifically concerning the representation of the Chen Shui-bian administration's stance on negotiations with China. The dialogue is focused on whether the article unfairly blames one side and lacks a neutral point of view (NPOV).

PalaceGuard008 begins by expressing concern that the article reads like propaganda for the former Chen Shui-bian administration and lacks nuance. They argue that the article should present a more balanced view that reflects the complexity of the situation, rather than placing all blame on one side.

Readin counters by stating that Taiwan was willing to talk without pre-conditions, while China insisted on pre-conditions that were unacceptable to Taiwan. They argue that this is a fact and not a matter of bias or propaganda.

PalaceGuard008 responds by suggesting that the article should either avoid interpretation altogether or present all major points of view. They also compare the Chen administration's approach to that of the subsequent Ma administration, which used the 1992 Consensus as a basis for negotiations, implying that Chen's administration was not genuinely willing to negotiate.

Readin asks for clarification on what pre-conditions Chen set for the talks, maintaining that Taiwan did not impose pre-conditions.

PalaceGuard008 clarifies that Taiwan's insistence on not using the ""one China principle"" or ""1992 Consensus"" as a basis for talks could be seen as a precondition and that the term ""willing"" might be misleading. They argue that Chen knew that his stance would be unacceptable to mainland China and suggest that it was more about domestic political posturing than a genuine attempt to negotiate.

The discussion shows a clear understanding of the historical and political context by both parties. Both users present their arguments with references to historical events (the 1992 Consensus) and the political strategies of different administrations. The dialogue is coherent, and both users engage with each other's points, attempting to clarify their positions and counterarguments.

However, the discussion could benefit from more direct evidence, such as quotes from Chen Shui-bian or official statements from both sides, to support the claims made. This would strengthen the arguments and provide a more solid basis for the discussion.

Overall, the discussion is civil, focused, and shows an effort to engage with complex political issues in a nuanced way. Both users are attempting to ensure that the article reflects a neutral point of view, which is a core principle of Wikipedia.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Non existing name

<user_id=M.K>
There is no such names as ""Truce of Niemieża"" ; as well as the ""name"" ""Niemieża"" is met only in PL google books scraps , in contrast to proper place name ''Nemėžis'' . Therefore such article naming is disputed.

<user_id=Piotrus>
I see no refs for Truce/Treaty of Nemezis in the links you provided.|

<user_id=M.K>
You failed to produce any English sources which would support current name, therefore tag restored.

<user_id=Lokyz>
From the provided links it is obvious, that most common name of the treaty in English language is Treaty of Vilna as Piotrus beloved google book search suggests - no Treaty of Wilno, (except in patriotic writings in the beginning of 19th century by physician) ando no Truce of Nemieza is found. While it may be popular in Polish historiography, this is English wikipedia and most commone name should be used.

<user_id=Piotrus>
I would not oppose a move to the Truce of Vilna.|

<user_id=Lokyz>
Care to provide any better books body count references than Treaty of Vilna?

<user_id=Piotrus>
Huh? Please be more clear.|

<user_id=Lokyz>
Well, as I've said earlier It seems that most common name for this ''treaty'' in English is ''Treaty of Vilna'', not ''truce of Vilna''. Aslo please, stop removing citation request and stop shuffling references around - Wilno and Nemeiza is the least  known names for this treaty, so there is no need to weaselise it by inserting wors like '''sometimes'''. ''Treaty of Vilna'' gets 34 (!) hits, truce of Vilna one book from 1841, treaty of Wilno one book by physician, and truce of Nemieza - a big zero.

<user_id=M.K>
I would like at last to receive and EN publication which would use ''Truce of Niemieża'' as name, currently there none.

<user_id=Piotrus>
On Wikipedia we distinguish between truces and treaties, just see the naming of relevant articles. Hence truce is more correct than treaty. I don't mind switching to Vilna, particularly if you stop disrupting the well-referenced ""truce of Niemża"" (based on translation of Polish term, and at least as good as your ref for Trakai Voivodeship).|

<user_id=Lokyz>
On Wikipedia we difference article names per WP:UE and most common name. references are provided, name is known as Treaty of Vilna. Should I move the article accordingly to as you did with the Eldership of Samogitia, that's still unreferenced? This move would be clear because of most known English name as it reads Treaty of Vilna. Check the references yourself.

<user_id=Piotrus>
Per Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names), in this case, our convention is to refer to truces as truces. Are you disputing it was a truce? |

<user_id=Piotrus>
First, could you show me an EN publication that uses Trakai Voivodeship? |

<user_id=Lokyz>
I think, this reference is put in the article by you. Correct me if I'm wrong.

<user_id=Piotrus>
I referenced all possible names. Not all of them are as correct, which is why the article is no longer named Truce/Treaty of Niemieża... or would you like to move it back? Dozens of refs support those variants, too... |

<user_id=Lokyz>
Ghm, so the ''most common name'' policy does not apply?

<user_id=Piotrus>
If my explanation don't help, I guess you need a practical lesson. America is more often used w/ regards to United States of America than the full name. Same for US and USA. Go ahead and move that article to its more common name, and than let's discuss this further. Or if you feel less bold, read the discussion here.|

<user_id=Lokyz>
Once again one did fail to provide any exact answer to my question. A really convenient position taken. I'll repeat my recent question. so the ''most common name'' policy does not apply? Or is someone making policies of his own? like IRC shopping?

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. The discussion begins with a user, M.K, pointing out that the name ""Truce of Niemieża"" does not exist and that the correct name should be ""Nemėžis"" or ""Treaty of Vilna."" This argument is based on the lack of English sources supporting the current name and the presence of the name in Polish sources. The argument is fact-based and relevant to the topic.

2. Piotrus responds by asking for references for the Treaty of Nemezis, indicating a need for evidence to support the claim. This is a reasonable request in a debate about naming conventions.

3. M.K insists on the need for English sources to support the current name and reinstates the tag for citation needed. This is a continuation of the initial argument and maintains the focus on the importance of sourcing.

4. Lokyz introduces the argument that the most common English name, according to Google Books, is ""Treaty of Vilna."" This is a new argument that introduces the concept of common usage in English, which is relevant to the discussion about English Wikipedia naming conventions.

5. Piotrus expresses openness to changing the name to ""Truce of Vilna,"" showing a willingness to compromise based on the evidence presented.

6. Lokyz asks for better references to support the name ""Treaty of Vilna,"" which is a continuation of the argument for common usage.

7. Piotrus asks for clarification, which is a reasonable request for specificity in a debate.

8. Lokyz provides evidence of common usage and criticizes Piotrus for removing citation requests and shuffling references, which is a procedural argument about maintaining the integrity of the Wikipedia editing process.

9. M.K reiterates the need for an English publication using the name ""Truce of Niemieża,"" emphasizing the importance of verifiability in English sources.

10. Piotrus argues for the distinction between truces and treaties on Wikipedia, which is a policy-based argument relevant to the naming conventions on the platform.

11. Lokyz challenges the application of the ""most common name"" policy, which is a valid point in the context of Wikipedia's naming conventions.

12. Piotrus uses an analogy with the naming of the United States of America to illustrate the application of common names, which is a rhetorical strategy to explain the policy.

Overall, the discussion involves a mix of fact-based arguments, policy references, and rhetorical strategies. The participants are engaged in a substantive debate about Wikipedia naming conventions, sourcing, and common usage. The arguments are generally coherent and relevant, although there are moments of tension and disagreement.

"<user_id=Qwyrxian>
Regarding a recent edit summary

<user_id=Qwyrxian>
I just wanted to clear up a point of misunderstanding evidenced in your recent edit summary.  You said, ""Added additional sentence for balance, to avoid misleading impression. Please don't delete without Talk discussion"".  Actually, that's the opposite of how normal WP editing works. It's fine to boldly add new information to an article. But if another editor reverts, the onus is on the person who ''added'' the info to the article to go to the talk page and justify its inclusionnot on the one who wants to remove. The way I always think of it is that we're ""conservative"", in the sense that the default is always less and older information, with those seeking changes being the ones who have to justify their new additions/changes.
As a side note, we definitely cannot include that information from VINEthey are not an important enough group to have their opinion represented. Perhaps if Greenpeace, PETA,  or a similarly notable organization made a comment, perhaps we could include itbut not the comments of a random, non-notable activist group.

<user_id=Qwyrxian>
Actually, here's a better, more general point: stop editing the article, and keep discussing on the talk page. If you're having a discussion on something on the talk page, stop reverting on the article. The whole point is to ''stop'' edit warring, which you are very much doing on the article (as are some other editors). Another way of saying that is that just because you're talking on the talk page doesn't give you justification for continuing to force your preferences to the article. There is absolutely no hurry on the articlewe'll fix it over time. But we cannot functionally do that if people don't stop reverting and talk '''instead'''.

<user_id=PE2011>
Thanks for explaining the process. Regarding VINE, they are at the heart of the controversy—VINE was mentioned earlier in the graf. Why are they not important to be included?

<user_id=PE2011>
Qwyrxian, your characterization that the VINE is a “random, non-notable activist group” is wholly inaccurate: as I mentionedand as it’s been documented in numerous sources, including the NYTVINE is a big part of this controversy.

<user_id=Kingsrow1975>
VINE is important because they made the first offer. That's it. They are quoted in news articles because of that fact. In reality, the most important entities involved in this whole deal are the college and the animal right activists. Since the initial offer, VINE has done nothing but make a few blog posts and ""open letters"" to the college. That is hardly being a ""big part"" of the issue. Read any story about this saga...by a large margin, the main players are the college and protesters.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Understanding of Wikipedia Policies: <user_id=Qwyrxian> demonstrates a clear understanding of Wikipedia's editing policies, particularly the ""bold, revert, discuss"" cycle. This user correctly points out that the onus is on the person adding new information to justify its inclusion if it is contested. This shows a good grasp of Wikipedia's consensus-seeking process and the importance of discussion over edit-warring.

2. Notability and Relevance: <user_id=Qwyrxian> also brings up the issue of notability and relevance, which is crucial in Wikipedia to ensure that the content is verifiable and that undue weight is not given to minor viewpoints. The argument that VINE may not be notable enough compared to organizations like Greenpeace or PETA is a valid point in the context of Wikipedia's guidelines.

3. Engagement in Discussion: <user_id=PE2011> responds by emphasizing the role of VINE in the controversy and their mention in multiple sources, including the NYT. This suggests that VINE's role may be more significant than <user_id=Qwyrxian> acknowledges, and thus their viewpoint could be relevant to the article.

4. Clarification of Importance: <user_id=Kingsrow1975> provides a clarification on the importance of VINE, stating that their initial offer is what makes them noteworthy in the context but also pointing out that their subsequent actions may not elevate their role in the controversy.

Overall, the discussion shows a good level of engagement with the subject matter and an understanding of Wikipedia's policies. The arguments presented are generally coherent and relevant, with each participant providing reasons for their stance. There is a clear attempt to reach a consensus through dialogue rather than edit-warring, which is in line with Wikipedia's collaborative ethos.

"<user_id=Jossi>
Reception section

<user_id=Jossi>
What happened to the well sourced, balanced and NPOV section that was called ""Reception""?

<user_id=QuackGuru>
Reception is a vague title and a lot of that information was not NPOV. Having a huge section is very silly and makes it difficult to read.

<user_id=Jossi>
Reception as a section is widely used, and ""i don't like it"", or it is ""silly"" is not an argument. As for the sources, which one was not NPOV? I am restoring that section and look forward to ''specific'' concerns to be raised.

<user_id=Jossi>
A ""Reception"" section that does not segregates ''pro'' and ''con'' viewpoints, and that rather presents all significant opinions on this site is the best way to reach NPOV.

<user_id=Elonka>
In terms of restoring sections, please be sure to acquaint yourself with the new #Conditions for editing on the article, especially that it is now under 0RR (no revert) restrictions.

<user_id=Jossi>
I missed that, thanks. But note that I simply restored the ""Reception"" section. Is that a revert?  Or is it that this is a ''status quo'' page that one cannot edit? Please clarify.

<user_id=Elonka>
It's borderline, leaning towards revert.  On the one hand, the information wasn't put in with a simple use of the ""undo"" or ""rollback"" buttons.  However, the information re-added was clearly a word for word restoral of a section from a few days ago, and when it was re-added, it removed some  tags, but without adequately addressing the concerns. Since the conditions are fairly new, we can write it off as ""the editor didn't know"", but if such a thing happened again, then it would be regarded as a violation of restrictions. In the future, a better way to handle it would be to move more slowly, adding a few sentences at a time, and trying to find a compromise version, without just doing a copy/paste restoral.

<user_id=Vsmith>
I've just reverted Jossi's ''massive revert''. Making such a revert as he did as an involved editor and saying ''I missed that'' and immediately going on wikibreak just won't work.
For Elonka to say ''it's borderline'' because ""undue"" or ""rollback"" weren't used is absurd. I didn't use those buttons so therefore I didn't revert by that ''reasoning''. If this editing restriction imposed by Elonka is to work, it must be applied to all involved editors and not waffle and allow an involved admin (Jossi) to violate the terms.

<user_id=Elonka>
Jossi had made no edits to the article since the restrictions were put in place, and it was reasonable to assume that Jossi did not know about the restrictions. ArbCom was clear that editors need to be informed: ""''Prior to any sanctions being imposed, the editor in question shall be given a warning with a link to this decision by an uninvolved administrator; and, where appropriate, should be counseled on specific steps that he or she can take to improve his or her editing in accordance with relevant policies and guidelines.''""  Jossi has now been informed about it, both here and at his user talkpage, and has not made any reverts since he has been notified.  If any editors had concerns about his edit, they could have gone in and changed the text, and then the editing continues from there.

<user_id=Vsmith>
Seems I've heard something about ''ignorance of the law is no excuse...'' But I'm not saying Jossi should be sanctioned - just backing up the restrictions to ''level the playing field.'' Now that Jossi is fully aware of the restrictions then she can proceed along with the other editors to improve the article.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Jossi's Argument: User Jossi argues for the restoration of the ""Reception"" section, stating that it is a common practice and that it presents all significant opinions, which is conducive to achieving a neutral point of view (NPOV). The argument is based on the premise that a balanced presentation of viewpoints is necessary for NPOV, which aligns with Wikipedia's guidelines. However, Jossi does not address the specific concerns about the section being non-NPOV or too large, which were raised by QuackGuru.

2. User QuackGuru's Argument: QuackGuru argues that the ""Reception"" section was not NPOV and that its size made it difficult to read. The argument is somewhat weak because it lacks specific examples of non-NPOV content and does not explain why the size of the section is an issue. The use of terms like ""vague"" and ""silly"" is also not constructive.

3. User Elonka's Argument: Elonka brings up the procedural aspect, mentioning the new editing restrictions and the need to avoid reverts. The argument is based on the rules set by the Wikipedia community, which is important for maintaining order in the editing process. Elonka's response is informative and attempts to guide Jossi on how to proceed under the new restrictions.

4. User Vsmith's Argument: Vsmith enforces the editing restrictions by reverting Jossi's edit and emphasizes the need for all editors to follow the rules, regardless of their status. The argument is strong in terms of upholding the rules and ensuring fairness among editors. Vsmith also points out that ignorance of the rules is not an excuse, which is a valid point in most rule-based systems.

Overall, the discussion involves a mix of procedural arguments and content-based arguments. The procedural arguments are clear and based on Wikipedia's guidelines and restrictions. The content-based arguments are less strong, as they lack specificity and constructive criticism. The dialogue could be improved by providing more detailed reasoning and evidence for the claims about the ""Reception"" section's NPOV status and readability.

On coup sources

<user_id=129.71.73.243>
Of the sites listed, none are from a prudent, verifiable website.  Of the content, it concerns the claim of an NSA official who resigned in protest of Nixon's Vietnam War policies and became a habitual critic of US foreign policy who is ostensibly reporting third-hand information.  This is little better than a rumor, and certainly not enough to flatly assert as fact that the CIA backed it.  There has been no actual proof of this claim published.

<user_id=Dabbler>
The websites are reporting previously published material and do give the references. Your POV that the CIA did not assist in a coup is not a verifiable source that they did not. There are four sources of whatever quality that assert they did, you have at least to provide some that assert that they did not and even then we report the controversy, not delete one viewpoint.

<user_id=129.71.73.243>
I'm not going to provide a source that says ""the CIA did not support the coup"" because that is asking to prove a negative.  It is not proper to link to blogs or to unverifiable, unreliable, sources per Wikipedia policy (and general good sourcing guidelines).  None of the links provided fit that standard.  If a ''New York Times'' link is found that gives the NSA official's comment, it can go in, but it would need to be heavily qualified.

<user_id=Dabbler>
I am suggesting that we report the controversy not try and pretend that no one has ever suggested that the CIA was involved. I changed the article to reflect that. You cannot deny that there have been reports for decades that the CIA was involved, regardless of whether it was true or not, and this is therefore relevant and should be included. If you can't even find a sourced statement that the CIA was not involved, then you should not be deleting sourced content.

<user_id=129.71.73.243>
You are suggesting that one should prove a negative in order to propagate some contrived ""debate"".  It is not relevant that some random official says he heard third-hand what the CIA supposedly did any more than it is relevant to the issue of bin Laden's biography that a random 21st century British politician said that the CIA supported him, in light of the noticeable failure to produce evidence on that point.  Spurious accusations with no proof have no place inside an encyclopedia, and in any case (as I already noted) the links themselves are not proper.

<user_id=Dabbler>
The reports are numerous, the references are from reputable sources, they just don't match your POV.

<user_id=129.71.73.243>
Simply asserting as much is not adequate, and this doesn't address what I am actually saying.

<user_id=129.71.73.243>
Again, this article is relying largely on Morris to say things there is no published proof of.  Links from random web sites don't pass muster with WP:RS, much less ''Newsmax'', which has about as much credibility as ""''Common Dreams''"".  I notice also how this isn't even referring to the same incident; it seems as if you went on a desperate Google search to get something to stick and sufficed for similarly spurious information on a previous incident.

<user_id=Dabbler>
Actually I copied the information and link from Saddam Hussein where it is considered to be an acceptable reference. Perhaps you had better go over there and start deleting referenced material from that article too.

<user_id=129.71.73.243>
I have no doubt (and I do not know why anyone should not) that there are a great number of Wikipedia articles that are improperly sourced (at least in parts), especially on such very contentious matters.  Regarding the issue of Google, it was perhaps an unfair characterization to make, but it is an aside.  I don't really believe it to be my duty to go on a general source-verification-crusade on this web site (lord knows it is not within the capacity of a thousand people, much less one), but this is one issue I have taken an interest in where I believe some respect for minimum standards should prevail.  Incidentally, Saddam Hussein is protected.

<user_id=Dabbler>
So I understand from the comment above that your deletion is based on original research, which is not a valid basis for including or excluding information from article.  Saddam Hussein is not protected for editor's with a vaild User Name.

<user_id=129.71.73.243>
I have no idea how you could possibly come to that conclusion.  I am not conducting or presenting original research, I am using common sense and guidelines in evaluating sources and claims for an encyclopedia article.  That is what all editors should be doing.

<user_id=Dabbler>
So it is your ""common sense"" rather than your ""original research"" that normally reliable sources such as The Guardian, Reuters, NYT etc. quoted in websites which you consider to be unreliable make those sources unreliable?

<user_id=Dabbler>
All I am asking is that you agree to allow it to be noted (with sources) that there have been people who have said that the CIA and/or American government agencies were involved in the coup against Qasim and that the CIA aided Saddam in his attempted assassination. You are very welcome to provide other '''sourced''' statements to the effect that these allegations are nonsense, but I don't believe you should exclude them completely because they exist.

",0,"The discussion revolves around the inclusion of information in a Wikipedia article concerning the CIA's involvement in a coup. User 129.71.73.243 argues against the inclusion of the information, stating that the sources are not verifiable or reliable according to Wikipedia's standards. They emphasize the importance of not propagating rumors or third-hand information without proper evidence, and they highlight the issue of proving a negative, which is not a standard requirement for establishing facts in an encyclopedia.

User Dabbler, on the other hand, argues for the inclusion of the information, pointing out that the sources, while not perfect, do reference reputable outlets like The Guardian, Reuters, and the New York Times. They suggest that the article should reflect the controversy and report on the existence of claims regarding the CIA's involvement, rather than asserting them as fact.

The quality of the arguments presented by both users varies:

- User 129.71.73.243 presents a strong argument about the importance of reliable sourcing and the avoidance of spreading unverified information. They correctly point out that Wikipedia's guidelines require reliable sources and that proving a negative is not a standard evidentiary requirement. However, they could improve their argument by acknowledging the existence of the controversy and suggesting a way to include it in the article without endorsing unverified claims.

- User Dabbler presents a reasonable argument that the existence of claims, even if controversial, should be acknowledged in the article. They also point out that the sources being questioned do cite reputable news organizations. However, Dabbler could strengthen their argument by addressing the concerns about the reliability of the secondary websites and by providing direct citations from the primary reputable sources.

The discussion is somewhat circular, with both users reiterating their points without reaching a consensus. However, both users are engaging with the topic seriously and are attempting to apply Wikipedia's standards to the situation. The introduction of a New York Times article by User 71.234.193.215 towards the end of the discussion helps to clarify the source of the information and adds credibility to the argument for inclusion.

Overall, the discussion is substantive and reflects a genuine effort to adhere to Wikipedia's content policies, despite some disagreement on the application of those policies. The arguments could be more constructive if both users focused on finding a compromise that respects Wikipedia's standards while acknowledging the existence of differing viewpoints on the topic.

Afghan heritage

<user_id=Chilum aw charrs>
Someone decided to use proxies/sockpuppets to remove the Category:Indian people of Afghan descent from this and other articles. Fardeen Khan's father (Feroz Khan) is well known by everyone on Bollywood as an Afghan who was born in India.
Feroz Khan's father was born in Afghanistan so that makes both Feroz Khan and Fardeen Khan Indians of Afghan heritage. It is stupid to remove this so please stop.

<user_id=Neelkamala>
Read what you linked before calling others stupid. ''Feroz Khan.... was born to a father with Afghan roots and a mother of Iranian origin and was reared in Bangalore.'' Feroz was not a Afghan, neither are his sons Fardeen and Zayed, they are Indians and you even removed the category '''Indian Shi'a Muslims''' giving a lame excuse of ""pashtuns are non-shias"". Well guess what? there are shia pasthuns and Feroz was one of them. Proof http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/news/india/Feroz-Khans-funeral/articleshow/4458096.cms ''Funeral prayers of Bollywood actor and director Feroz Khan funeral at Bangalore '''Shia burial ground''' carried by son Fardeen and his uncle Sanjay Khan along with other relatives.'' I would be better you stop converting people's religious sect.

<user_id=Chilum aw charrs>
Feroz, his brothers and their children are Indians of Afghan descent. They became citizens of India but they are Afghan by descent and heritage. All articles about people in Wikipedia mention this information, see Barak Obama, Salma Hayek, Charles Bronson and million other famous people.

<user_id=Chilum aw charrs>
That is not proof for the Shia claim. It suggests that you are not only anti-Afghan but also a Shia.

<user_id=Neelkamala>
Fardeen Khan's father Feroz khan and mother both were born in India and were Indians, neither of them claimed to be Afghans during their lifetime. I don't know why you want them tagged as such. As far as obama is concerned he has a kenyan father that makes him american of kenyan descent, which is missing in this case.

<user_id=Neelkamala>
Most of the people named in ''Indians of Afghan descent'' don't have references to backup the claim of Afghan descent, thanks for the pointing out, I will add the correct tag so that issue is sorted out.

<user_id=Neelkamala>
Feroz Khan was born and buried in a exclusively shia burial ground, that proves him being a Shia. No need to get angry and accuse others. If you cant accept or refute the facts sourced from reputed newspapers, that's your choice, but don't make allegations of me being anti-anybody. I respect everyone including afghans but wikipedia is not a place to add unsourced data or change a man's religious sect. Thanks

Ofcourse they were Indians but of Afghan and Iranian origins, meaning they were different from the larger native Indians. The ""neither of them claimed to be Afghans during their lifetime"" is completely irrelevant.

<user_id=Chilum aw charrs>
About '''Afghan''' or '''Pathan''', that is refering to their ethnic background, like Punjabi, Bengali, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Arab, Turkish, Scottish, Spanish, French, and etc. You're trying to mislead us here with citizenship, and that is also irrevelant because ""Indians of Afghan descent"" clearly states that he is Indian but of Afghan origin or descent. Suppose a white British man from the United Kingdom came to India and gave birth to children do you think we no longer mention their British origins? Many readers want to trace Fardeen Khan's background because he is very popular actor and how will they learn if you are removing that? There are 100s of sources that mention him being Afghan by origin , , , , , , , being born in America or in India does not change a person's ethnicity or heritage. For example, if you are Indian from India and born in America you are therefore officially refered to as an Indian-American. All your children will be refered to as Indian-Americans even if they don't accept it.

<user_id=Chilum aw charrs>
Feroz Khan was born and buried in a exclusively shia burial ground???? He was born in a shia burial ground???? What are you saying?

<user_id=Chilum aw charrs>
In Islam there is no such thing and Shia burial ground/Sunni burial ground. We can determine that Feroz Khan was Muslim because Hindus cremate their deads, but there is no source mentioning him being a Shia. If you find it that's fine but so far this is just an educated guess. It's possible that he practiced Shia Islam and it's possible that he didn't, and it's possible he was just buried next to his mother who was of Iranian origin and possibly a Shia. A Shia is someone who follows Shia Islam, if there is no source then this should not be mentioned.

<user_id=2001:558:6045:A0:391F:B005:179D:8DD9>
Educated guesses don't belong in Wikipedia. You either find a source that definitively states his religious beliefs one way or the other, or any information about it needs to be removed from the article.

<user_id=Chilum aw charrs>
What? Who are you?

<user_id=2001:558:6045:A0:391F:B005:179D:8DD9>
Who I am is irrelevant. What ''is'' relevant is Wikipedia policies and guidelines on WP:BLP and WP:RS, which I've just summarized for you.

<user_id=Chilum aw charrs>
You just said educated guesses don't belong in Wikipedia, you must be talking to Neelkamala because he is guessing someone's religious sect. As for Afghan (Pathan), I provided The Times of India, Mid Day, Pajhwok Afghan News, and these , , , , , , which all say that they are ethnic Afghans (Pathans).

<user_id=Chilum aw charrs>
A consensus is needed to add a sentence about his father being Afghan?     This is especially important because India is NOT the same as the West where a person born automatically becomes a natural born citizen. In other words, an Afghan born in India is Afghan.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Argument about Afghan Descent**: User ""Chilum aw charrs"" argues that Fardeen Khan and his family should be categorized as ""Indian people of Afghan descent"" because Feroz Khan's father was born in Afghanistan. This argument is based on the idea that heritage and descent are important aspects of a person's identity and should be recognized. The user compares this to other notable figures like Barack Obama and Salma Hayek, who are recognized for their heritage.

2. **Counterargument about Citizenship and Identity**: User ""Neelkamala"" counters that Feroz Khan and his family were born in India and were Indian citizens, and that they never claimed Afghan nationality. This argument suggests that citizenship and self-identification should take precedence over ancestral heritage when categorizing individuals.

3. **Argument about Religious Affiliation**: User ""Neelkamala"" also argues that Feroz Khan was Shia because he was buried in a Shia burial ground. This is used to refute the removal of the category ""Indian Shi'a Muslims"" from the article.

4. **Counterargument about Religious Affiliation**: User ""Chilum aw charrs"" argues that being buried in a Shia burial ground is not definitive proof of Feroz Khan's religious beliefs and that without explicit sources, it is speculative to label his religious sect.

5. **Intervention by Another User**: A third user, with the IP address ""2001:558:6045:A0:391F:B005:179D:8DD9,"" intervenes to remind the participants of Wikipedia's policies on biographies of living persons and the need for reliable sources, emphasizing that educated guesses are not appropriate for Wikipedia content.

6. **Suggestion for Dispute Resolution**: User ""Ekabhishek"" suggests seeking a third opinion or going to the dispute resolution noticeboard if a consensus cannot be reached, which is a constructive approach to resolving the disagreement.

Overall, the discussion involves a mix of valid points about the importance of heritage and the need for clear evidence when making claims about a person's identity. The arguments about Afghan descent are somewhat supported by references, while the arguments about religious affiliation lack definitive sources and are therefore weaker. The participants are engaged in a substantive debate, but there is a lack of consensus and some tension in the tone of the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Republic of Kosovo redirect

<user_id=Husond>
Users Beamathan and Dbachmann have set out to change the target of this redirect (until now redirecting to Kosovo) to Kosovo#Republic of Kosovo, thus leading to a tiny section of this article. In my view, this is just another POV disruption, as this move pretends to alienate the republic from the region, as if users searching for ""Republic of Kosovo"" were supposed to be searching for a small note on what would be an unimportant detail about Kosovo. Not the case. Every matter regarding the Republic of Kosovo is related to Kosovo itself, like it or not, therefore users searching for ""Republic of Kosovo"" should be redirected to the top of this article. Furthermore, I don't think there's ever been a consensus for this re-targeting of the redirect. Feedback is welcome.

<user_id=NOAH>
Actually I agree with you that Beamthan is acting like he owns the Kosovo article and he is the one who decides what the article should contain, where it should link etc etc. Nice to see that I am not the only one who has seen the bias and is speaking out. Have a nice evening.

<user_id=Beamathan>
Noah, I'm so sorry that your edits haven't been reasonable. Good luck in the future buddy. And this article, Kosovo, is about Kosovo. We have a section about RoK. This section should be expanded, I have asked our Kosovo experts to help us on that, but to no avail. I hope it gets done shortly.

<user_id=NOAH>
You have asked the Kosovo experts? Maybe you don't know that since according to your edit log you entered Wikipedia a few weeks ago, but you should know that I consider myself a Kosovo/Balkan-expert and have contributed in Kosovo-related articles for almost three years. In the end I repeat that I still consider your edits biased

<user_id=Revolving Bugbear>
I would like to remind everyone to '''''comment on the edits, not on the editor''''' and to remain civil and maintain etiquette. This applies to everyone and is not optional. -

<user_id=Beamathan>
Noah, I have no bias. You obviously are an ROK supporter, and are as a result biased. It's pretty evident. However this doesn't mean that you can't rise above it. Please, assist us in the Republic of Kosovo section of the article. We need people who are knowledgeable on the RoK, and the situation on the ground. Just remember to use proper sources. Goto this talk section Talk:Kosovo#Calling_all_REPUPBLIC_OF_KOSOVO_experts and discuss your proposals. We need the help and if you are as you claim, you could help us.

<user_id=Husond>
Beam, you don't need to tell other editors what to do and how to do it. This ""calling on Republic of Kosovo experts"" (if there's actually such thing since the subject is merely 3 months old and that's hardly enough time for someone to get a PhD on the matter) is not how we function. Calling others biased also not how we function.

<user_id=Beamathan>
Husond, I am not telling people how to do it. I am simply presenting the best way to edit such a contentious article. Do you disagree with discussing a content change prior to making it, if it has a chance to be controversial? I think that's common sense. Also in the case of providing the WP:IDONTLIKEIT link I was just trying to assist someone. Then after being insulted, I linked WP:AGF which would have prevented my insult if good faith was assumed. I don't see how providin information on WIkipedia is ""telling people how to do it."" And as far as the RoK section goes, we really need some RoK experts to help with the section. I'm no expert, regardless of how much reading and studying on the subject I've done. We have editors that live in Kosovo, that may be able to form the section in a better way than I would.

<user_id=Husond>
Beam, a user living in Kosovo would not make him or her an expert. A Kosovar's personal experience on the ground would equal to original research, which we are not looking for.

<user_id=Beamathan>
Maybe you didn't read what I said. Perhaps those people who live there, or are very well versed in the area would be better suited to help form this section. Cited reliable sources are of course necessary, and an NPOV is of course needed as well. However, I figured these people would want to help with that particular part of the article.

<user_id=BalkanFever>
Can we stop with the experts thing, please? Beam, I know what you are trying to say, but this petty discussion on who is an expert is absolutely useless. Back to the problem: Husond, I disagree with you. The majority of people that type in ""Republic of Kosovo"" would be looking for the partially-recognised state, which is why they are being specific, as opposed to only typing in ""Kosovo"". Ideally, Republic of Kosovo would be its own article, and we would not have this problem, but I am reluctant to start a split discussion for fear of bringing back the nationalist rants, among other things. ''''''

<user_id=Husond>
I really don't agree. Users searching for ""Republic of Kosovo"" could be searching for many different aspects e.g. the population of the Republic of Kosovo, or maybe the history of the Republic of Kosovo long before it became a republic. So many things really, and all of them are covered in the article as a whole. Limiting the search to a sub-section with basic notions about the republic really doesn't make sense to me. On a related and very relevant note, I find it quite inconsistent that some users are pushing for Republic of Kosovo to redirect to Kosovo#Republic of Kosovo, whereas Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija still happily redirects to Kosovo and not to Kosovo#Autonomous Province under UN administration. I was not surprised with this blatant lack of neutrality.

<user_id=BalkanFever>
Well, to me, this whole thing is a bit on the WP:LAME side, since redirects are cheap, but you guys can have your arguments. I'd just rather that this didn't escalate to incivility. ''''''

<user_id=Husond>
?

<user_id=BalkanFever>
What I mean is, your (all of you) edit summaries weren't very productive, especially over a fairly trivial issue. Even though I disagreed with you, Husond, I am content with a redirect to the top of the page, just as I am also content with a redirect to the section. I fail to see how it makes that big a difference. ''''''

<user_id=Dbachmann>
Republic of Kosovo is (at present) a redirect to this article. This article contains a section called ""Republic of Kosovo"". It is thus a section redirect (). Don't turn everything into a big drama, there is no cabal. Sheesh. I'm still waiting for Husond's first ''constructive'' contribution to the Kosovo topic.

<user_id=NOAH>
I agree once again with Husond. Most of the people will not search ""Republic of Kosovo"" but only Kosovo BUT expect to find information about the Republic of Kosovo. Most countries have the prefix ""the Republic"" but this is not used by Wikipedia, e.g. Croatia instead of Republic of Croatia, Albania instead of Republic of Albania. For me and for most people of the world there is no difference between Kosovo and RoK.

<user_id=128.206.162.135>
Delete it all. This article on accuracy and quality is a 1/5.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=Husond>
I am appalled at your comment. First, I've made many ''constructive'' contributions to this topic, regardless of what you consider ""constructive"". Second, even if I hadn't, I am still within my right to discuss and be involved in this topic or any other topic whenever I wish. Third, you are turning this into a drama more than I am, everything was fine until you've decided to modify the redirect without discussing it first. Fourth, ""drama"" as a matter of fact is not my definition of a complaint. Your attitude dwells into WP:OWN, and by not even commenting on my bringing up the fact that Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija redirects to the top of the article and not to a section, which by the way you have redirected yourself and which constitutes obvious double standards, I think that you are also dwelling into WP:POV.

<user_id=NOAH>
I totally disagree with you, Dbachmann. After reading many of Husond's answers to you and other people here at the Kosovo article, I am convinced that Husond is a very constructive contributor and his help and contribution to make Kosovo-articles more NPOV is more than welcome. Until now all Husond's answers have been very reasonable.

<user_id=Beamathan>
Yes quite, when someone agrees you with it's easy to say that you are ""convinced they are a very constructive contributor."" I'm tiring of people putting their POV above the article.

<user_id=Husond>
Whereas someone who does not agree with you, is not. That's not a good philosophy. Please stop disrupting the redirect, trying to enforce your changes without consensus and then accusing users reverting them of also going against consensus is not a good philosophy either.

<user_id=Beamathan>
I've given up. You don't care about the facts, only your POV Pushing. Does having it redirect to the article in general make the RoK more legitimate or something? Are you really that sick with bias? I can't describe how disgusting such a strong bias is. Really. I can't put into text how maddening it is to deal with your POV Pushing. If you want to try this over the phone, I can email you my number and perhaps with the facts and logic actually spoken to you you'd understand. Or you're being malicious and no revelation can change that. I'm all done with that redirect. As BalkansFever says, I'll have to choose the instances of NPOV to fight for, instead of each and every little one. Good luck with your POV Pushing. You seem to have a great ally in your cause in Noah. Have fun!

<user_id=NOAH>
I should be reading now and not discuss but I just have to answer you. I believe, maybe because of the short time you have been here, you have the wrong approach on how to edit, and maintain NPOV on this article. You can say other people are putting their POV above the article, but the same can we say about you. Without wanting to insult you, I can say you are not the most neutral editor on this article. Again, without wanting to insult, based on what I have seen of your edits I am seeing a pro-Serb or maybe anti-Kosovo independence bias. You have still not given a reasonable answer why we should not remove the sentence I proposed under ""Rule of law"". You say discussion first before edit and than you don't discuss. How should e interpret it?

<user_id=NOAH>
Me, and based on what I have read, also Husond, are fighting for NPOV. While some others (from now on I will try to not use names) are using what us Wikipedians call ""Trolling"" to disrupt developing Kosovo article towards NPOV.

<user_id=Husond>
I am nobody's ally. This rant was really unnecessary, aggressive and overdramatic. I can't really see how do you plan to have any credit on fighting for NPOV after comments like this.

<user_id=Beamathan>
Husond, my credibility comes from my actions. And I'm sorry, but I just don't understand your intentions. I'll let your actions stand for what they are and comment no further on the redirect. It's really too bad though.

<user_id=Beamathan>
And Noah (I will use names to be specific), what isn't NPOV? I told you SEVERAL times. Discuss anything you think isn't NPOV. Other than deleting credible sourced items, and trying to add biased content to the article I haven't seen you ""help"" much. I'm looking forward to it though.

<user_id=IkonicDeath>
As this has to do with the redirect.
Taiwan has two articles, one about the region, and one about the Republic of China (Taiwan) and Taiwan is recognized by far less countries then Kosovo (not that it makes Taiwan less important), further more on that point Kosovo is recognized by the majority of the worlds most powerful countries.
Therefore I suggest there be a similiar situation as Taiwan, where we have one article on the region that has been historically considered Kosovo and another article on the Republic of Kosovo.

Unfortunately you continue to offend other editors. Have you read what I have written until now on this talk page? The quote that is included in the ""Rule of Law"" section is not conform NPOV rules that Wikipedia have. The quote is included mainly for propaganda purposes but you have never discussed and instead just reverted my edits. But if no one is against removing the quote I will go ahead with the edit where the quote will be removed. Please don't act like you own Wikipedia. It belongs to all of us. I would also like to know when did I add biased content?? Apart from removing the propaganda quote I updated the constitution section and is this what you are calling POV? The only thing I did was to write the constitution was approved. With personal attacks instead of discussiing the topic you are only proving I was right when I used some adjectives you did not like to describe you. This is my last answer to you.

<user_id=Kosova2008>
The biggest contributers on all Kosova or Kosovo articles seem to hate having to share the power of editing. They get offended if someone points out the fact that the article lacks credibility or neutrality. Husond I'm sure you've noticed this yourself, a split would be a great way to let the user decide if he/she rather read about Republic of Kosova or Kosovo (geography).

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Relevance to the Topic**: The discussion is centered around the appropriate redirection of the ""Republic of Kosovo"" page on Wikipedia. All participants are focused on the topic at hand, debating whether it should redirect to the main Kosovo article or to a specific section within that article. This shows relevance to the topic.

2. **Factual Accuracy**: The participants reference specific Wikipedia policies and past editing practices, such as WP:NPOV (Neutral Point of View) and the handling of similar cases like Taiwan. This indicates a level of factual accuracy in their arguments.

3. **Coherence**: The arguments presented by various users are coherent and follow a logical structure. They present their points, counterpoints, and justifications in a manner that is understandable and follows the thread of the discussion.

4. **Civility**: There are instances where the discussion devolves into personal attacks and accusations of bias, which detracts from the overall quality of the argumentation. Civility is an important aspect of a productive discussion, and the lack of it in certain exchanges negatively impacts the quality.

5. **Constructiveness**: Some users, like Husond and NOAH, are attempting to engage in a constructive dialogue by presenting their views on why the redirect should be handled in a certain way. However, the discussion is sometimes sidetracked by less constructive comments and personal disagreements.

6. **Consensus-building**: There is an attempt by some users to build consensus or at least to invite others to contribute to a particular section of the article. This is a positive aspect of the discussion, as Wikipedia relies on consensus for editing decisions.

7. **Rhetorical Strategies**: The use of rhetorical strategies varies among participants. Some, like Beamathan, attempt to appeal to the need for expertise and the importance of neutrality, while others, like Husond, focus on consistency and precedent in Wikipedia editing practices.

8. **Respect for Wikipedia Policies**: Most participants reference Wikipedia policies to support their arguments, which shows a respect for the platform's guidelines. However, the application and interpretation of these policies are points of contention.

Considering these factors, the discussion has elements of a high-quality debate, such as relevance, factual accuracy, and coherence. However, the quality is diminished by instances of incivility, personal attacks, and a lack of focus on constructiveness and consensus-building. The discussion reflects a mix of strong and weak argumentative practices.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Language

He wrote in the Prilep-Bitola dialect of the Macedonian language. He identified as Bulgarian. It's fairly clear-cut. So why try and state that from a particular POV?

Sure, but as long as it remains ''his'' POV and doesn't override academic consensus. No, we should respect Cepenkov's choice of nation.

None but the very last source mentions Cepenkov. And even if we take this as sole evidence, we still have a problem with changing the text, since it only states what it was and is now. It was once defined as Bulgarian, and defined as such by the author himself, and is now defined as ''Prilep Macedonian''.

<user_id=WavesSaid>
I said the Prilep-Bitola dialect was Macedonian and you asked me for a source. I provided you with seven. The Prilep-Bitola dialect did not go from being Bulgarian to Macedonian; only the name for it did. Cepenkov's use of the term ""Bulgarian"" only confirms this. This article is being written in the 21st century, not in Cepenkov's own time. And Cepenkov is not a linguist and even if he were, his views would be at odds with the rest of the world. No, this article is about Marko Cepenkov. There are other articles for that: ex. History of the Macedonian language.

<user_id=Laveol>
I asked you for a ref that Cepenkov wrote in Macedonian. Cepenkov's views matter about the article on him. Why would we need an article on him if we were to disregard him altogether?

@Jingiby. That would be anachronistic. Only the terminology has changed since Cepenkov's time. His language ''is'' Macedonian, but it once ''was'' described as ""Bulgarian"". Let me put this in perspective for you: what would your argument be had he called his language ""Chinese""?

<user_id=Jingiby>
His language ''was'' Bulgarian, but today it is classified as Macedonian, after such language was codified.

This discussion isn't getting anywhere and you're being very discourteous, so I'm going to distance myself from this article and make a request for comment.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The discussion revolves around the classification of the Prilep-Bitola dialect spoken by Marko Cepenkov and whether it should be referred to as Macedonian or Bulgarian in the context of a Wikipedia article.

2. User WavesSaid argues that the Prilep-Bitola dialect is universally classified as Macedonian by providing several linguistic sources that refer to the dialect as Macedonian. This user emphasizes the importance of current academic consensus over historical self-identification.

3. User Laveol questions the relevance of the provided sources to Cepenkov's personal views and the historical context in which he lived. Laveol argues that Cepenkov's own identification as Bulgarian should be considered in the article.

4. User Jingiby states that the language was Bulgarian in the past but is now classified as Macedonian after the codification of the Macedonian language.

5. User WavesSaid counters by saying that only the terminology has changed and that the language itself has been consistent, suggesting that the historical label of ""Bulgarian"" was a matter of terminology rather than linguistic substance.

6. The discussion becomes somewhat circular, with both sides reiterating their points without reaching a consensus. User WavesSaid decides to distance themselves from the article and request further comments from others.

7. Throughout the discussion, there is a mix of factual references to linguistic literature and appeals to historical context. However, there is also a degree of tension and a lack of willingness to find common ground or compromise.

Evaluation of Argument Quality:

- User WavesSaid provides multiple sources to support their argument, which strengthens the quality of their argument.
- User Laveol raises valid points about historical context and the importance of Cepenkov's self-identification, which is relevant to the discussion.
- User Jingiby's argument is brief and does not provide additional sources or elaborate on the historical context, which weakens the argument's quality.
- The discussion lacks a constructive resolution and becomes somewhat confrontational, which detracts from the overall quality.

Considering the evidence provided, the relevance of the arguments to the topic, and the coherence of the discussion, the quality of the arguments is moderate. There is a clear effort to use sources and historical context, but the discussion is marred by a lack of resolution and civility.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Neutrality dispute

<user_id=Terrawatt>
I have added the neutrality dispute tag, because it looks like there are editors who systematically remove all criticism. This is unacceptable under WP:NPOV. The most recent edit of this sort is this one, where well-sourced criticism is deleted without explanation. I see from reading earlier posts on this talk page that there was at one time a ""criticism"" section of the article, which has evidently been deleted. The Dalai Lama's contact with the Nazis is mentioned in this context, but it appears nowhere in the article. These defects must be fixed before the article can be considered to be in compliance with the NPOV policy.

<user_id=Yunfeng>
If by criticism you mean slander, then I agree.  I for one will continue to delete all additions (of which we have seen a lot) that are along the lines of ""the dalai lama kills puppies, this is proved by [insert name of fifth-rate newspaper or propaganda mouthpiece]"".  The criticism has to be real criticism, not crap that is intended - by the original author and the Wikipedia editor who cites it - to make the subject of the article look bad.

<user_id=Yunfeng>
You have stated this well yourself in the past: ""...as everyone involved in this discussion can clearly see, the distortions of one of [Tenzin Gyatso]'s most extreme and irresponsible critics are being presented as fact.""

<user_id=Tdudkowski>
In this article is mentioned also ""she is also vice-chairwoman of the standing committee of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Congress, or regional parliament"". It's all about her credibility.

<user_id=Nat Krause>
Maybe there should be a general section for Tibetan religious and former-élite types who have denounced the current Dalai Lama? But perhaps not: some might say that this reflects more on the character of those individuals, and/or on the system which encourages those denunciations, than on the present subject.—·

<user_id=Terrawatt>
Add that to the article, then. It's a well-sourced criticism coming from a notable individual.

That should be obvious: all criticism is removed, no matter how well sourced. The article lacks balance. NPOV policy requires that all viewpoints be represented.

<user_id=Sunray>
Would you be able to provide examples? In a recent case (see ""Religious Controversy,"" above), the sources were problematic and the text removed was in violation of WP:BLP.

<user_id=Terrawatt>
Well, in this case () the sources are not problematic, and there is no basis more removing them under BLP. One of the deleted edits is a news report that the Pope decided not to meet with the Dalai Lama, and the other is a comment by the lady who is supposed to be a living female Buddha, and ""also vice-chairwoman of the standing committee of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Congress, or regional parliament,"" claiming that the DL is acting in conflict with the faith. As far as I can see, these items were removed strictly for POV reasons, which is the basis for my assertion that the article is not neutral. If it were neutral, all notable viewpoints, including those critical of the DL, would be included. It appears to me that the article is being watch-dogged, WP:OWNed and sanitized by fans of the DL.

<user_id=Relata refero>
I have no opinion on the DL. I do know that an argument has not been made that these recent statements are in any way notable for the biography of a 72-year old man that has been the subject of several book and article-length profiles. Read WP:UNDUE.

<user_id=Sunray>
Terrawatt: You are saying that the article is not neutral because someone removed that cruft about the Pope not meeting with the Dali Lama?? I agree with Relata refero. This is in no way notable enough to be included in this article.

<user_id=Terrawatt>
I can't help but wonder why it is ""notable"" when the Dalai Lama gets a positive reception from one Pope, but it is ""cruft"" when he gets a negative reception from another. Perhaps you might begin to get the idea as to why this article seems biased to an outsider.

<user_id=Sunray>
Perhaps you might read (or re-read) WP:BLP.

<user_id=Nat Krause>
Can you cite anything more specific about that than simply citing the whole page? What do you mean?—·

<user_id=Sunray>
Sure, the section on Well-known public figures states: ""If an allegation or incident is notable, relevant... it belongs in the article."" There is a huge boatload of information on the Dalai Lama, so the criterion of notability is important. An example referred to, above, was the mention of the Pope deciding not to meet with the Dalai Lama. That is a non-event. If the Pope had decided to meet with the Dalai Lama, it likely would have been notable, depending on what happened and the coverage of the event.

<user_id=Strettolicious>
It had been anticipated that the Pope would meet with the Dalai Lama, and his decision not to do so was a surprise. That's why it is notable. I'd like to know why there is no criticism section  it looks like at one time there was one. Is the Dalai Lama now immune to criticism at Wikipedia?

<user_id=Nat Krause>
There is no basis for saying that it is ""more about the pope than the Dalai Lama."" There is no basis for putting ""news"" in scare quotes. These are feeble arguments, which appear to be an attempt to defend POV-driven censorship.

<user_id=Nat Krause>
Everything that was in the Criticism section is still in the article; it's just that there is no longer a separate section for it.—·

<user_id=Nat Krause>
The deleted material I mention at the beginning of this section should be restored; the material discussed at Talk:Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama#Dalai Lama's contacts with Nazis and Neo-nazis are completely missing. should be in the article, and possibly the material deleted by Yunfeng in this edit (I'm unfamiliar with that particular controversy, but there is a clear pattern of editors who are routinely sanitizing this article of all criticism.)

<user_id=Sunray>
Who did it surprise? Surely not anyone who has been watching the current Pope (the point being that this ""news"" item is more about the Pope than the Dalai Lama).

<user_id=YellowMonkey>
Random PRC official talking on a Chinese run government mouthpiece. Not notable. ''''''  ('''')

<user_id=YellowMonkey>
Explain how it is notable if some famous person has a timetable conflict and can't make it to a meeting. ''''''  ('''')

<user_id=Terrawatt>
Please don't play games. You know as well as I that the meeting was cancelled for political reasons.

<user_id=Terrawatt>
The more I look at this article, the more absurd I find it to be. The lede had the following sentence: ""He is the political and spiritual leader of Tibetans worldwide."" This article is like a fan page, controlled by editors who can't tell the difference between the Dalai Lama and God. All claims of his followers are presented as fact, and any information to the contrary is immediately deleted, no matter how well sourced. And on top of that, his followers keep removing the NPOV template.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Neutrality and Notability**: Terrawatt raises concerns about the neutrality of the article, citing the systematic removal of criticism as a violation of Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View (NPOV) policy. They argue that well-sourced criticism is being deleted without explanation, which is a valid concern in maintaining a balanced article.

2. **Relevance of Criticism**: Yunfeng counters by suggesting that only legitimate criticism should be included, not slander or poorly sourced claims. This is a reasonable stance, as Wikipedia's standards require reliable sourcing and relevance to the subject's notability.

3. **Credibility of Sources**: Tdudkowski and Nat Krause discuss the credibility of sources, with Tdudkowski pointing out the political position of a critic, which could lend weight to the criticism's relevance. Nat Krause suggests that the character of the individuals making the criticisms might be more telling than the criticisms themselves, which is a fair point but does not directly address the issue of NPOV in the article.

4. **Application of Wikipedia Policies**: Sunray asks for specific examples of neutrality violations and refers to Wikipedia's policy on biographies of living persons (WP:BLP), which is important for ensuring that content about living individuals is responsibly handled. However, Sunray's request for examples is met with specific instances by Terrawatt, who argues that the removal of certain criticisms lacks justification.

5. **Notability and Significance**: Relata refero and Sunray argue that the notability of certain events, such as the Pope not meeting with the Dalai Lama, may not be significant enough to include in the article. This is a valid point, as Wikipedia's guidelines on due weight (WP:UNDUE) suggest that not all events are significant enough to warrant inclusion.

6. **Consistency in Treatment of Information**: Terrawatt points out a potential inconsistency in how positive and negative receptions of the Dalai Lama are treated, which is a legitimate concern for maintaining a neutral tone in the article.

7. **Editorial Discretion and Bias**: Strettolicious and Nat Krause discuss the potential for editorial bias and the importance of including criticism in a balanced manner. YellowMonkey dismisses certain criticisms as not notable without providing a strong rationale, which could be seen as an attempt to minimize valid concerns.

Overall, the discussion shows a mix of valid concerns about neutrality and notability, as well as attempts to apply Wikipedia's policies correctly. However, there are also instances where the reasoning behind the removal of content is not fully explained or justified, which could indicate a bias or a lack of understanding of the NPOV policy. The quality of the arguments varies, with some participants providing clear and policy-based reasoning, while others seem to dismiss concerns without adequate explanation.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Piotrus>
Important fact

<user_id=Piotrus>
I don't understand why this well referenced fact is getting removed. Battle of Warsaw (1920) saved Lithuanian from Soviet occupation in 1920 (as clearly noted by several referenced historians) and hence is a crucial event that shaped interwar Lithuanian history. The fact surely deserves to be mentioned? |

<user_id=Irpen>
It is removed per WP:UNDUE. We've seen such adding the same info to multiple articles before, going by a wider and wider scope. This is unacceptable. The trick of pasting same info to several articles is not new (""Brest parade"" or Russian Enlightenment (Zaluski library_ examples come to mind.)
There are narrow articles for narrow issues like that. This is the second largest by scope Lithuanian article. This is exactly what was done by now gone  who added a section ''Homophobia in Poland'' directly into Poland article even though LGBT rights in Poland was readily available. Piotrus was right to revert the fellow back then and I expect the same standards applied to Polish and Lithuanian topics.

<user_id=Piotrus>
There is nothing wrong with pasting important fact into several relevant articles. This is a crucial fact that belongs here. The outcome of the Polish-Soviet War saved independent Lithuania - this is stated clearly by several historians who specialize in Lithuanian history (Lithuanian Senn, Polish Łossowski, and others). This is not a fringe undue issue like the one discussed above (a good counterexample); it's a major event that seems quite 'in place' here.|

<user_id=Irpen>
Your view that ""there is nothing wrong with pasting"" illustrates the problem perfectly. You did not pioneer this approach and you and I even managed to agree when this was done years ago by Molobo and together removed such stuff. I am saddened to see that you now resort to same.

<user_id=Irpen>
Just to be more specific, we are talking the width of the scope here: both of the article (extremely wide scope, second largest scope of all Lithuanian topics) and the piece of content (narrow claim related to a fringe (by the sacle of the topic) event, besides a POV, even if referenced, rather than an undisputed fact.) Same info pasted into several articles of the same scope/width ''may be'' acceptable. This is not the case. Just curious, is there a reason why you did not paste this also directly to the Lithuania article to its history section or even lead? If you answer this question, it would be easier for you to agree with me here.

<user_id=Piotrus>
This is off topic, but there is nothing wrong with pasting information into many articles - whether it's a redirect / disambig fix, a relevant newly uploaded image, reference or expansion - as long as it is of due weight, as in this case.|

<user_id=Piotrus>
The main Lithuanian article barely has room for the mention of P-L war and the P-S is a bit off topic to it. This article, which has room to mention both and go into the situation in more detail, certainly can mention the not-so-fringe battle (listed by some in the top twenty or so most important in mankind's history) that allowed Lithuania the crucial two decades of independence between the world wars.|

<user_id=Zscout370>
If the paragraph could be cut down just a tad, I think it can go in there. 1000 bytes of information, with appropriate citations (which this article lacks, btw), could be a bit much. Also use links when needed.

<user_id=M.K>
I have to agree with Irpen here and per similar per WP:UNDUE concerns expressed per above dispute (which I will resume soon after will solve another one). Plus I would like to request a border citation of source ''Antanas Ruksa, Kovos del Lietuvos nepriklausomybes, t.3, p.417'', to pin point a context.

<user_id=Novickas>
Pasting a predictably contentious paragraph across several articles - not in the spirit of consensus. As an example of a differing interpretation, from the Cambridge History of Russia: ""Not least because of the Royal Navy offshore, the Baltic States - Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia - were where Lenin cut his losses. He granted diplomatic recognition to these bourgeois regimes...""  (the recognition was in July 1920 - the Battle of Warsaw was in August). The concept that Russia was planning to overrun a multitude of other states has been contested by Orlando Figes in ''A People's Tragedy''. I don't have any problem with the inclusion of a condensed version of this paragraph as long as it is balanced.

<user_id=Dr. Dan>
The unfortunate fact remains that ''""a spirit of consensus""'' and ''""balance""'' are not something that a multitude of edits from certain quarters consistently demonstrate. Your differing interpretations are refreshing and appreciated.

<user_id=Doopdoop>
I agree with Irpen here primarily due to WP:UNDUE concerns.

<user_id=Piotrus>
What UNDUE? The importance of battle of Warsaw for Lithuanian independence is not a theory of one fringe historian but a fact repeated in many publications by many historians. I have mentioned Senna, Łossowski, Ruksa. If that's not enough, have some more: Snyder Had the Poles been defeated in summer 1920, Bolshevik Russia would have certainly absorbed the tiny Lithuanian state.""; Hiden: battle of Warsaw in August 1920, an event which brought considerably nearer the international recognition of the full independence of the Baltic countries; and others. I have no problems with shortening the para if editors think it is too long, but the event is certainly important (and no jokes about Royal Navy in the Baltic doing anything in 1920, please).|

<user_id=Doopdoop>
There were many events that weakened the Soviets and stopped them from taking over Lithuania and other European countries. While the miracle at Warsaw is one of the most important of such events, there are simply too many of them.

<user_id=Piotrus>
Then can you name the others? With 4 or more citations from major publications for each? I find it dubious that the battle is to undue, when we have an entire unreferenced para on Bermontians; when we have a place to mention the unreferenced but ""crucial help of Saxon volunteers"" and when we have two paragraphs on how the Poles took control of the Vilnius region - with enough space to go into elections and League of Nations involvement - but we cannot find space to note that the Poles have nonetheless saved Lithuanian independence by thwarting Soviet westward aggression.|

<user_id=Doopdoop>
Why don't you write in the [History of Poland] article that the miracle at Warsaw has thwarted Soviet plans for taking over the whole Europe (or at least Baltic states, Poland, Germany, Hungary)?

<user_id=M.K>
I am pretty sure the relevant articles make appropriate claims; after all Battle of Warsaw (1920) has been a Featured Article for something like two years now. Notable historians such as A.J.P. Taylor, Norman Davies, Ronald Grigor Suny and others have noted as such (although often they refer to the outcome of the PSW in general, although this is a small detail - nobody can dispute that it was that battle which determined the end result of the war more than any other event of the war).|

<user_id=M.K>
This is just plain silly to compare battle of Warsaw and the Polish occupation of Vilnius in magnitude. Because battle of Warsaw is single bullet in the list. Moreover my plea for citations fo particular publications is not met till now.

<user_id=M.K>
Indeed. A major battle in the world (European) history versus a minor border dispute that is major only to Lithuania (with all due respect) are not always comparable; however this article is centered on Lithuania and hence this makes the Vilnius dispute relatively prominent.|

<user_id=Doopdoop>
You have misunderstood my previous comment. Couple of minutes ago I have added abovementioned information to the History of Poland article, where it is much needed and was missing (maybe you would like to copyedit it a little bit). However in the context of Lithuanian history it should be noted that all anti-Soviet forces had a big role in stopping Soviets (there is even a book called ""Churchill's Crusade: The British Invasion of Russia""), keep in mind that Soviets had to divide their resources to fight their many enemies.

<user_id=M.K>
Prefect, I see the change in attitude towards Norman Davies, a notable historian, as he described here. Somehow, last time I was using him as reference, he was accused of using   flowery language. Any chance that we see at last his quote ''It was highly significant that Pilsudski could boast of not being a member of the Polish nation - which he once derided as ""a nation of morons"" - but a Lithuanian of Polish culture'' as cited in N. Davies; Heart of Europe: A Short History of Poland.p.139?

<user_id=Piotrus>
No strawmen or off-topic discussions, please.|

<user_id=Dr. Dan>
Piotrus is correct. Pilsudski's calling the Polish nation morons is not relevant to the topic.

<user_id=M.K>
It is a mere example, then in one instance it became ""Important fact"" in other ""flowery language"". Just trying to understand criteria, that is it.

<user_id=Dr. Dan>
I'm well aware that P.P. likes to use Norman Davies as a source when Davies supports a contention of his, and to dimiss him when it doesn't.

<user_id=Tymek>
I was very saddened to have read this remark by Dr Dan, who pretends to be a NPOV user, and yet he retreats to personal attacks on Piotrus. What does Pilsudski's remark have to do with history of Lithuania? Perhaps we should stick to the article, it will help in the future. It was just a friedndly remark, Dan, do not be grateful.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Relevance of the Battle of Warsaw**: Piotrus argues that the Battle of Warsaw (1920) is a significant event that influenced Lithuanian history and therefore should be included in the article. He supports his argument with references from historians, indicating that the battle saved Lithuania from Soviet occupation. This is a strong argument as it is backed by historical sources and is directly relevant to the topic at hand.

2. **WP:UNDUE and Scope**: Irpen counters with the Wikipedia policy WP:UNDUE, which suggests that undue weight should not be given to minor aspects of a topic in relation to the article's scope. He argues that the Battle of Warsaw might be too narrow a focus for the broad scope of the Lithuanian article. This is a valid concern within the context of Wikipedia's guidelines, but it does not directly refute the historical significance of the event.

3. **Consensus and Balance**: Novickas and Dr. Dan bring up the need for consensus and balance, suggesting that the paragraph in question could be included if it is condensed and balanced with other viewpoints. This is a constructive approach that seeks to find a middle ground.

4. **Multiplicity of Events**: Doopdoop points out that there were many events that contributed to the prevention of Soviet occupation of Lithuania, not just the Battle of Warsaw. This argument suggests that the significance of the battle might be overstated by Piotrus. However, Doopdoop does not provide specific examples or references to support this claim.

5. **Historical Context and Interpretation**: M.K requests a specific citation to verify the context of a source, which is a reasonable request for ensuring factual accuracy. Additionally, Novickas provides an alternative interpretation of events from the Cambridge History of Russia, which adds depth to the discussion.

6. **Off-topic Remarks**: The discussion veers off-topic with remarks about Pilsudski and Norman Davies, which are not directly relevant to the quality of the argument about the Battle of Warsaw's significance to Lithuanian history.

Overall, the discussion includes several well-reasoned arguments supported by historical references and Wikipedia policies. There is a clear effort by some participants to adhere to Wikipedia's standards for neutrality and verifiability. However, the discussion is occasionally sidetracked by less relevant points and personal remarks, which detract from the overall quality.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Scjessey>
From the horse's mouth

<user_id=Scjessey>
Sanford (Sandy) Newman writes in the ''Wall Street Journal'' (July 22, 2008):
John Fund's ""Obama's Liberal Shock Troops"" (op-ed, July 12) has some facts wrong. The historic nonpartisan drive to increase voter participation that Barack Obama led in 1992 wasn't for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, but for Project Vote  of which I was the national director in 1992.
Instead of accepting far more prestigious and better paying offers, Mr. Obama accepted a grueling job with Project Vote for a meager salary. He believed so much in the democratic process that he even gave up the contract for publication of his book, not knowing whether he would ever find another publisher. He brought a broad spectrum of community organizations into that effort, conducting what remains the most successful nonpartisan voter drive in Illinois history.
Project Vote remains a separate organization today. Indeed, it wasn't until after Mr. Obama's tenure had ended that it began to conduct projects more frequently with Acorn than with other community-based organizations.
Both Project Vote and Acorn should be proud that their efforts have increased voting. Acorn should also be proud of its other work, including winning minimum-wage increases and helping lead the fight against predatory lending and unfair foreclosures.
Mr. Obama's willingness to sacrifice because of his deep commitment to strengthening the democratic process is something that all Americans should applaud regardless of their party or politics.
''Sanford A. Newman'''
Takoma Park, Md.
Obviously this is a primary source, so secondary sources are still desired (and required) to guarantee accuracy; nevertheless, I think we can safely say that the ""arm"" nonsense can be dropped for good.

<user_id=Arzel>
This is nothing more than Newman coming to the defense of Obama and provide damage control, when this isn't even about Obama and there isn't even any damage to control.  I particularly like how he praises ACORN and PV, yet only writes in to say that Obama has no connection to ACORN.  I swear, the more people try to say there is no connection, the more clear it is that there is a connection.

<user_id=Scjessey>
Which part of ""Project Vote remains a separate organization today"" do you not understand?

<user_id=Bdell555>
What part of ""Project Vote is an arm of ACORN"" don't YOU understand?  You dismiss sources like the National Review as partisan, yet don't consider this source as similarly tainted by partisanship?  I noticed that in today's NY Times, the paper felt it necessary to print a correction that ""Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You” should not have included an ""of"" before ""You"".  Such is the attention to accuracy in details.  In any case, I have no objection to the article stating that although Project Vote is an arm of ACORN, former national director Newman insists that Project Vote is a separate organization.  You could even have ""separate organization"" as being of the same status as what's cited to the NY Times and TIME (i.e. not an allegation), so long as the cited sources for ""separate"" say ""separate"" and are not merely interpreted as saying ""separate"".  Again, there is no mutual exclusivity here.

<user_id=Scjessey>
Now I think you are being intentionally disruptive. PV is '''not''' an arm of ACORN, and the two mainstream sources you are citing are demonstrably wrong. The former director of the organization has publicly stated they are separate, and PV's 501(c)(3) status ''requires'' it to be a separate organization. TIME and NYT aren't going to be printing any corrections ''four years'' after the fact.

<user_id=Arzel>
You are intentionally ignoring reliable evidence showing the connection...I think it is you that is being intentionally disruptive.  As I said earlier, one organization can be an ""arm"" and be seperate from the other.  Newman, above, is quite cleaver in crafting his words to make the point that Obama didn't work for ACORN, but not make the statement that PV and ACORN are not closely related.  He also doesn't say that PV is not an arm of ACORN, and as I clearly stated earlier, it is common for one organization to be an arm of another yet be seperate entities.  The fear of any link between Obama and ACORN is so strong as to have clouded the judgement of many here.  It is time for this craziness to end.  We have reliable source stating that PV is an ""arm"" of ACORN, unless it can be proven that this is a lie there is no reason to continue to stonewall.

<user_id=Scjessey>
'""We have reliable source stating that PV is an ""arm"" of ACORN, unless it can be proven that this is a lie""''
Sorry, but the burden of proof always lies with the person wishing to add information to the article, so the contentious ""arm"" phrasing cannot be added until there is a consensus that agrees with its use. The reliability of the sources has been called into question because of more recent evidence and sources (as opposed to four-year-old inaccurate sources) indicating separation. It is our duty to ''exclude'' contentious details when their veracity is suspect. The continued '''push''' to use ""arm"" is strong evidence of agenda-driven editing, and this is simply not acceptable in Wikipedia.

<user_id=Bdell555>
The proof has been clearly shown.  The New York Times and TIME believe that the sources like Michelle Malkin which refer to PV as a ""503 arm"" are clearly accurate.  ACORN evidently agrees, reprinting the terminology on its website, despite the fact it is in ACORN's interest to play up the separation.  Even a blind squirrel like Malkin can find an acorn sometimes.  Project Vote's current director has styled himself as working for ""Project Vote/ACORN"".  Your own agenda has apparently caused you to reject the proof by imagining that an entity cannot possibly be an ""arm"" and be ""separate"" to an extent at the same time.  This ""all birds must be yellow"" argument of yours was refuted days ago.

<user_id=Arzel>
Sorry, but if you have a problem with the RS then take it to WP:RS for clarrification.  You cannot simply decide when a reliable source is deemed unreliable.  The NYT and TIME are both WP:RS, if you start treading down the path of judging when their reporting is reliable you have completely run off the path of good judgement.  You don't even have a RS which contradicts either the NYT or TIME.  The onus has been shown.  WP:V, WP:WEIGHT, WP:RS have all been satisfied, there is no other reason for dismissal other than that you don't believe it.  I see only one agenda being driven here.  The agenda to obscure as much as possible the relationship between the two, which is most ironic when ACORN clearly identifies itself with PV in a very substantial manner.

<user_id=Scjessey>
Completely wrong. The NYT and TIME articles are inaccurate, but neither will print a retraction '''four years''' after the articles were written. And who cares what Michelle Malkin says? She is a conservative pundit, and it is not Wikipedia's job to regurgitate punditry and pretend it is the truth. Remember that it was Malkin who practically urged people to boycott Dunkin' Donuts because of a scarf that Rachel Ray was wearing. Certainly there is no consensus for ""arm"" in any case, and I doubt this will change anytime soon.

<user_id=Arzel>
How do you know that the NYT and TIME artilces are inaccurate about PV being created as an arm of ACORN?  Your strawman arguements carry no weight.  Unless you can prove that the NYT and TIME articles are inaccurate then you have no basis for rejection.

<user_id=Scjessey>
What straw man arguments? We have a cast-iron primary source, and we have supplemental primary sources in the form of court documents and tax status. Secondary sources are also available, though less specific. I haven't done a search yet, but I will.

<user_id=Bdell555>
According to Simon, the League of Women Voters Education Fund cannot be an ""arm"" of the League of Women Voters.  Why?  Because this ""Education Fund"" is a 501(c)(3) and, as Simon argues, ""NYT and TIME state that PV is an ""arm"" of ACORN. PV is a separate entity to ACORN, as evidenced by PV's 501(c)(3) status. Therefore, NYT and TIME are in error. Q.E.D."".  All those sources that describe this Education Fund an an ""arm""?  All necessarily ""in error"", by Simon's logic.  Same with all those sources that describe the NRA Foundation as an ""arm"" of the NRA. The United States Student Association Foundation?  ""Separate"" from the United States Student Association in Simon's world.  Is the ACLU even a reliable source about itself?  Not according to Simon, because it says on aclu.org that ""[t]he ACLU Foundation (ACLUF) is the national tax-deductible, 501(c)(3) arm of the ACLU.""

<user_id=Bdell555>
Why should we care what Sanford Newman says, in that case?  Is he any less in the bag for Obama than Malkin is out of it?  Rick Block's absence of sources don't trump real sources, and your partisan sources don't trump partisan sources on the other side anymore than they are themselves trumped.  Fact is, I don't necessarily have a problem with your partisan sources (there being no necessary link between partisanship and reliability when it comes to claims of fact as opposed to conclusions and opinions) as I've encouraged you to add them if you think ""arm"" needs to be nuanced somehow.

<user_id=Rick Block>
Can you please explain why it's so important to include the precise phrase ""arm of"" in this article given that there are other more precise, more meaningful, and (at least in some editors' opinion) more accurate ways of describing the relationship between these two organizations?  You're heard the arguments against and apparently reject them.  What's the argument ''for'' choosing to use this specific terminology among all other possible ways to describe these two organizations?  Because the NY Times and TIME Magazine said it means we might consider using it, but given there are reasons not to use these words (albeit reasons you reject), why these words rather than any others?

<user_id=Bdell555>
If you've been following me, you'd note that I've never advocated ""these words rather than any others"".  I have no objections to other descriptions appearing as well, so long as they are equally well sourced and reflect what the sources directly say as opposed to someone's subjective interpretation.  I'm not the one lobbying for an incomplete or partial description.

<user_id=Arzel>
I agree.  ""Arm"" is not a requirement, only that the proper origination of PV be identified.  It is clear from the RS available that ACORN is the originator, there have been no RS that have denied this connection.  In fact the only reason I have seen to reject this connection is because of a belief that there is an agenda to associate Obama with the  transgressions of ACORN.  Since there is no attempt to make this connection here, there should be no reason to cloud the truth which is verifiable.

<user_id=Arzel>
Strawman 1... Malkin, Strawman 2... that the NYT or the TIMES won't print a retraction after 4 years.  Your ""cast-iron"" source doesn't make the claim that they are not born of each other, only that Obama worked for PV and not ACORN.

<user_id=Rick Block>
Curious.  You don't care that it says ""arm"" specifically, yet you edit war to make it so.  How about ""affiliated with"", like it says on the ACORN website?  The point several people are making is that being a 501c(3) organization that is simply an ""arm"" of another, non-501c(3) organization, is arguably illegal (depending, of course, on what the ill-defined phrase ""arm of"" means).  They must be legally separate.  By using ""arm of"" the article is now strongly implying these organizations are not separate.  Project Vote is unquestionably a 501c(3) organization.  It is unquestionably affiliated with ACORN.  Why say ""is an arm of"" when ""is a 501c(3) organization, affiliated with"" is more accurate and less contentious?

",0,"The discussion revolves around whether to describe Project Vote (PV) as an ""arm of"" ACORN in a Wikipedia article, with various users presenting arguments for and against this characterization. The main points of contention are the accuracy of sources, the legal and organizational relationship between PV and ACORN, and the implications of the term ""arm of.""

User Scjessey argues against using the term ""arm of,"" citing a primary source from Sanford Newman, the former national director of Project Vote, who states that PV is a separate organization from ACORN. Scjessey also points out that PV's 501(c)(3) status requires it to be a separate entity, which is a legal argument supporting the separation of the two organizations.

User Arzel, on the other hand, insists that reliable sources such as the New York Times and TIME have described PV as an ""arm of"" ACORN and that this description should be included unless proven inaccurate. Arzel suggests that an organization can be an ""arm"" and separate at the same time, indicating a more nuanced understanding of organizational relationships.

User Bdell555 supports the inclusion of the term ""arm of,"" arguing that the sources describing PV as such are reliable and that the term does not necessarily imply a lack of separation. Bdell555 also challenges the notion that a 501(c)(3) status precludes an organization from being an ""arm"" of another.

User Rick Block questions the importance of using the specific term ""arm of"" and suggests using ""affiliated with"" instead, which is less contentious and more accurately reflects the legal requirement for separation between a 501(c)(3) organization and another entity.

Throughout the discussion, there is a mix of logical reasoning, citation of sources, and attempts to interpret legal and organizational structures. However, there are also instances of ad hominem attacks, straw man arguments, and a focus on semantics rather than substance. The discussion sometimes veers away from constructive debate towards a more confrontational tone, which detracts from the overall quality.

Considering the use of primary and secondary sources, the legal arguments presented, and the attempts to clarify the relationship between PV and ACORN, the discussion demonstrates a moderate level of quality. However, the quality is diminished by the occasional fallacies and the confrontational nature of some comments.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5.",5.5

Neutrality

<user_id=71.76.189.11>
The recent edit by 96.231.117.108 smacks far too much of political advertising, which is far beyond any standard of neutrality. Lines like ""Congressman McHenry has fought for adequate veterans' health care for his district."" are clearly stuff from his own campaign- any Congressman in the world would say the same thing, and it's not necessary to list out his individual votes like merit badges for an overgrown boy scout. If someone doesn't edit this, I may, but we need to somehow retain the important information and get rid of the blatant self-promotion going on here.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=Ziegfest>
I'll take it up right now, and I invite other (legitimate, non-McHenry) guys to work with the material as it stands. I'm making the decision to remove much of the Hickory Clinic, as many current Congressmen work on similar projects and Wikipedia has yet to chronicle those- it seems needless, lest we all want to begin documenting in excruciating detail every vote made by each Congressman. In addition, a lot of it references back to his website- reads like an ad, go figure. Anyway, thoughts on my edit (coming up in about 10 mins)?

<user_id=Ziegfest>
Quick note- McHenry is not involved in H.R. 1616, according to info- which isn't even the bill mentioned. I attached the only one that appears connected to the whole meth topic, but correct me if I'm wrong.

<user_id=Potus128>
You are incorrect.  I have updated the page with the cite to his legislation, H.R. 1616, which was incorporated into larger legislation.  The text (including bill number) can be found here: http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.1616:

I removed the last two external links because they both violated NPOV. The second one is a blog that is poorly sourced. Some Members of Congress have external links to their state or national political party, but I can't find any that have hate sites in the list.

<user_id=Ziegfest>
Added them back. The blog is well sourced and referenced in a few newspapers (both the Hickory Daily Record and News@Norman). To remove the link would be to unfairly balance the article pro-McHenry, and honestly, it's only a link anyway. McHenry's site is full of pro-McHenry information and clearly at the top, it's not as if readers will be unfairly biased- and in defense of the site, it is properly sourced even to Wikipedia standards. Far from ""attack sites"" such as Pat Go Bye Bye, which was on here for some time. To remove it would be meaningless- and considering it's been in newspapers, it's certainly wikipedia-worthy.

<user_id=Potus128>
This blog is not in keeping with Wikipedia's standards on biographies of living persons (BLPs).  Specifically: ""Be very firm about the use of high quality references. Unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material about living persons — whether the material is negative, positive, or just questionable — should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion, from Wikipedia articles, talk pages, user pages, and project space.[2]""

<user_id=71.76.189.11>
Incorrect. Looking at the site, it contains sources to MANY reputable news and info organizations (The Charlotte Observer, OpenSecrets, etc). Just because it is negative does not make it poorly sourced- scanning the articles, it has more links than a Wikipedia article. From your history, you continue to try to add a blog laughably named ""McHenry Rocks""- are we supposed to believe you? Nice try.

<user_id=Ystava>
Actually, the blog you are referencing that  repeatedly attempts to insert would not itself meet Wikipedia standards for WP:BLP. A sheer number of links does not indicate that the links are all reliable either WP:CITE. Neither you or  appear to be assuming good faith WP:CIVIL. Seeking mediation.

<user_id=Ystava>
The blog is ONLY referenced in two newspapers in a letter to the editor (both letters written by the same person whose POV is clearly not neutral). The article without the link to the blog is not pro-McHenry, it is neutral. The purpose of the article is encyclopedicNOT POV pushing as you keep doing.

On August 7, the blog  keeps using for POV pushing seems to indicate that the editor is working with Ziegfest on this issue. This appears to be a huge violation of WP:COI.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The initial concern raised by <user_id=71.76.189.11> is about maintaining neutrality in the article and avoiding political advertising. This is a valid point in line with Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View (NPOV) policy.

2. <user_id=Ziegfest> responds by agreeing to edit the article and invites others to collaborate. This shows a willingness to engage with the community and improve the article's neutrality.

3. <user_id=Potus128> corrects a factual error regarding H.R. 1616, providing a source. This contributes positively to the discussion by ensuring factual accuracy.

4. <user_id=Ystava> removes external links that they believe violate NPOV. This action is consistent with Wikipedia's guidelines, although it may be subject to debate depending on the nature of the links.

5. <user_id=Ziegfest> argues for the inclusion of the blog link, citing its use in newspapers and its sourcing. This is a reasonable argument if the blog is indeed well-sourced and recognized by reputable third parties.

6. <user_id=Potus128> counters by referencing Wikipedia's standards on biographies of living persons (BLPs), emphasizing the need for high-quality references. This is an important point, as BLPs are sensitive and require careful sourcing.

7. <user_id=71.76.189.11> defends the blog's sourcing quality, which is a valid argument if the blog's sources are indeed reputable.

8. <user_id=Ystava> points out that the blog's references in newspapers were in letters to the editor, which may not be considered neutral or reliable sources. This is a critical observation that questions the blog's suitability as a source.

9. <user_id=65.40.234.49> notes a violation of the three-revert rule, which is a procedural point that helps maintain order in the editing process.

10. <user_id=Ystava> provides additional context about the blog's references and attempts to resolve the issue through discussion, which is a constructive approach.

11. Finally, <user_id=Ystava> raises a concern about a potential conflict of interest (COI), which is a serious issue in Wikipedia editing.

Overall, the discussion shows a mix of valid points, adherence to Wikipedia policies, and attempts to resolve disputes constructively. However, there are also signs of tension and potential COI, which can detract from the quality of the discussion. The participants are engaged and mostly provide reasoned arguments, but the discussion could benefit from more focus on consensus-building and less on back-and-forth contention.

"<user_id=Saxophilist>
Why do you keep adding those pieces to the Saxophone page? I have never heard of them and I have never even seen them mentioned before.

<user_id=Hstokar>
I have not used 'talk' before so I hope this reaches you.  I am sorry that you personally do not know the Wuorinen works - but they are indeed major contributions to the repertoire.  I can give you names of a dozen players that can confirm this. Both published by CF Peters.   The Concerto - written for the Raschers and performed throughout Europe and the US, and the duo hundreds of times throughout the world by many players (there are at least two recordings so far).  If you are inclding Glass, Denisov and Husa others should be added (that you are not aware of).  Isn't that the point of wikipedia?   Also any sax player interested in 20th century music would immediately think of the Webern and the Wolpe...but maybe they need to be in a separate section, major chamber works?
Another major composition I just thought of Tristan Keuris - his Saxophone Quartet Concerto and Sax Quartet have been widely performed, and are very highly regarded. And what about the Berio Sequenza IXb for alto saxophone (1981)?
Finally on solos in orchestra works I'm sure some of the Del Tredici 'Alice' piece have such but I need to confirm with the publisher Boosey and Hawkes.

<user_id=Saxophilist>
Hello, I have never heard of the Wourinen, Harbison, Halffter, Keuris, Babbit, or Florio pieces. Can you please show me that they are standards in the repertoire and that they were recorded by well-known saxophonists before we include them? Are any of these pieces experimental or atonal? I have heard of the Xenakis and Berio pieces. The Xenakis could stay, but I think that should be the only piece of experimental or atonal music included in the article. I think I'll add the Muczynski pieces to the article.

<user_id=Saxophilist>
Also, I will be creating a section for quartet pieces.

<user_id=Hstokar>
You keep using the word 'standard works' and I am not sure what that means - title of the list is 'major works.'  The Harbison was premiered by 100 players simultaneously (for example).  Ask the Rascher Quartet about the Halffter, Wuorinen and Keuris.  The fact that you have not heard of them does not mean they should be excluded from such a list.   Check with some players that specialize in contemporary music - such as John Sampen, Ken Radnofsky, Harry White.... Please do not keep removing the additiona I have made  My expertise is in contemporary music.  These are carefully considered additions.

<user_id=Saxophilist>
Are any of them experimental or atonal? Also, the list is supposed to be short and contain only the most well-known pieces in the repertoire.

<user_id=Hstokar>
the rep is growing far more extensively now with many excellent players and ensembles commissioning and championing new works.  My additions are all 'major' additions to the rep. Also an idication that some of the finest composers of our day are writing for the instruments. No idea what you mean by atonal - unless you are specifically referring to work such as those written by Schoenberg before he adopted the so called ;'12-tone system'?  As for experimental that is too broad a term.  I have no idea what it means musically.

<user_id=Saxophilist>
XAS is an example of experimental music. Are any of the pieces you listed experimental? Also, the works you added are not standards in the repertoire yet. It might take many years before they become standards, if they ever even do. Until then, they should not be in the list.

<user_id=74.73.161.77>
Again not sure what you mean by experimental.  That is not a technical term.   If you want to list 'standards' change the name of the list to reflect that and delete the Glass, Densov.  Do you prefer I start a list titled Repertoire?  This this is a wiki page - should allow other input.

<user_id=Saxophilist>
Stuff that sounds like this is considered to be experimental: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QBeCC5DJ4c. Stuff that sounds like a bunch of noise and with multiphonics and other odd things. Experimental music is not in the standard repertoire. Only a few players play that stuff. Also, the Glass and the Denisov ''are'' standards.

<user_id=Hstokar>
sorry but you seem to know little about contemporary music.  I've listed major works by major living

<user_id=Saxophilist>
I'm sorry, but most of the works you added are not standards in the repertoire. They might be standards one day, but right now they aren't.

<user_id=Hstokar>
list is titled MAJOR works.  These are all major works.

<user_id=Saxophilist>
Hello, thank you for your contributions. I have done some research and found out several of the pieces you added are indeed standards in the repertoire. Others, however, are not standard. I will edit accordingly. Thanks again. Also, I will re-title the section ""Standard works of the repertoire"".

<user_id=Saxophilist>
I also just made a list of saxophone quartets and added some of your suggestions. If you think I'm missing a quartet, just let me know. Thank you.

<user_id=Hstokar>
I think using the word 'standard' or 'major' implies evaluations that are not universal.  I changed the title to 'Selected' so additional works can be added and it makes clear that the list is only a partial representation.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. User Hstokar argues for the inclusion of certain works in the saxophone page, citing their significance and performances by notable players. They provide specific examples and mention that the pieces are published by a reputable publisher, CF Peters.

2. User Saxophilist expresses skepticism about the inclusion of these works, stating they have never heard of them and questioning their status as ""standards"" in the repertoire. They request evidence that these works are recorded by well-known saxophonists.

3. User Hstokar counters by questioning the definition of ""standard works"" and provides examples of performances and recognition of the pieces they added. They also suggest consulting with players specializing in contemporary music.

4. User Saxophilist asks for clarification on whether the pieces are experimental or atonal, indicating a preference for a list that contains only the most well-known pieces.

5. User Hstokar explains their view on the growing repertoire and defends the significance of the added works. They also challenge the use of the term ""experimental"" as too broad and unclear.

6. User Saxophilist provides an example of what they consider experimental music and reiterates that the works added by Hstokar are not yet standards.

7. User Hstokar insists on the importance of the works they listed and suggests that the list should be open to other inputs.

8. User Saxophilist conducts research and acknowledges that several of the pieces added by Hstokar are indeed standards, agreeing to edit the list accordingly. They also agree to change the title to ""Standard works of the repertoire"" and create a separate list for saxophone quartets.

9. User Hstokar suggests changing the title to ""Selected works"" to avoid the implication of universal evaluations and to allow for a broader representation of works.

The discussion shows a progression from disagreement to a compromise. Both users present arguments with varying degrees of evidence and reasoning. User Hstokar provides specific examples and references to the music community, while User Saxophilist initially relies on personal knowledge and later conducts research to inform their position. The dialogue ends with a constructive resolution, with both users contributing to the improvement of the saxophone page.

Semi-protected edit request on 10 June 2014

<user_id=Froggerlaura>
The consensus seems to be that there are no structural differences in the hoof wall keratins between white and dark hooves. One of the more recent studies found no difference in shoeing horses with white hooves . Another conformation article  references older studies that came to the same conclusion.

<user_id=71.181.48.72>
Interesting.  Wonder how many horses in the study had both light and dark feet, noting that the one case had different results; that is definitely my own observation, that a horse with both light and dark feet has differences (usually slightly softer white feet) between them. The adage that white feet are inherently inferior is not the point anyone is making here, but wonder about validity of these studies, saw one indicating that white hooves absorbed more moisture, though black hooves could absorb quite a bit also.  That 2004 one says ""22 shod hooves were obtained for testing"" - sounds like cadaver hooves - do you have the full article, were they live horses tested?  I suppose we could downplay the white hooves thing here if it ends the drama, but it was an issue raised, so I don't know if that's best. I think it's overkill to view the issue as completely debunked or as a ""superstition"" as there clearly needs to be more research done.

<user_id=Montanabw>
No.  That article is in a blog that cites a study done in 1986, it is insufficient for WP:RS.  Also, phrases such as ""superstition"" are unencyclopedic.  White hooves ARE a bit softer, anyone who has ever seen a hoof trimming can tell you that.  This does not mean that they are ""inferior,"" just that they may have different issues, particularly for horses kept in stalls most of the time, as is done with race horses. If there is a better study, feel free to post it here, and we can take another look at it.

<user_id=216.227.122.184>
ask anyone who has seen a hoof trimming and""my own observation"" are not scientific resources. The article you cite only gives a farrier's statement, not a scientific study. I have a horse with 3 black hooves and a white one, guess which one is the problem? Not the white one...

<user_id=216.227.122.184>
Please find me a study that shows that white hooves are inferior, because from what I've seen all the studies except ""your experience"" show that they are equal, so your statements are 100% unscientific. There are reasons we use science and not superstition in modern society. Just because you were wearing those particular underwear every time your team has won a football game has nothing to do with why they won it. Please keep wikipedia factual. I don't care if you add in my statement, as long as you remove the old one because there is simply no evidence. This is why we can't have nice things... http://theperfecthorse.blogspot.com/2009/07/white-hooves-vs-dark-hooves.html  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=Montanabw>
Your little blog is not a RS.  The article does not state that white hooves are weaker or inferior, nor is it implied.  I am not making an argument that the horse has weak feet, we are stating what the trainer himself said.  We are going down a rabbit hole per WP:UNDUE to add all your commentary about ""debunked"" and ""superstition"" when in fact, the studies are small and though indicate that both colors of feet are similar, they are inconclusive as far as ""debunking"" (particularly when the same horse has two different colors of feet) due to small samples and lack of clear design (one study sounds like they used cadaver hooves). Even these studies indicate that there ARE a few differences in things like moisture content.

<user_id=216.227.122.184>
It is not ""my little blog"" I have no idea who writes it,  and I pointed you to it because it speaks to why farriers and other horse people are reluctant to change their views even when presented with scientific evidence. Basically, because people hate to be wrong. The California Chrome article DOES state that they are more prone to problems, which implies that they are inferior. You are not directly quoting the trainer, so this implies that you are stating it as fact. The links I posted point to scientific studies that show that white and black hooves are structurally the same. You keep complaining that they are old studies, yet you leave the statement about white feet in there even though you have yet to produce a scientific study that backs you up. There are plenty of people who hold all kinds of misconceptions, and it's articles like this that perpetuate old wives tales over actual scientific evidence. This is the same reason people don't vaccinate their children, because they don't understand how science works and they think they are smarter than their doctors. Of the 2 horses currently in my barn, I have an OTTB with 4 black hooves that chip like nobody's business, and a welsh cob who has a white foot which is like iron and the farrier has to work hard to trim it, but one of her black feet has a quarter crack. By your observational logic, black hooves are weak. Thankfully scientists don't rely on weak correlation and anecdotal evidence. Leaving this in here is why professors don't allow wikipedia as a reference for research papers...

<user_id=216.227.122.184>

<user_id=Montanabw>
And now you are edit warring.  The material you have cited now is by Jaime Jackson, who is a WP:FRINGE practitioner with little credibility in the mainstream.  This is most definitely not the place for the ""barefooter movement"" to start pushing their fringe theories.  This article has NONE of your ""inferior"" rants in it, merely a statement that is sourced about one horse's generally healthy - but white - feet.  Read what it says and read the source material.  Remove this content again and I am going to report you as a vandal.

<user_id=216.227.122.184>
It is published in the american farrier journal, so I guess you don't believe articles in medical journals either and rely only on your own anecdotal evidence when it comes to decisions about your medical treatment. Your own citations are about as informative as ""we interviewed a hospital orderly, and he said you can catch a cold by standing outside in the rain"" the person making the statement is not a medical professional. You have still failed to provide a source other than the trainer's statements that white hooves are softer and more prone to problems which if ""more prone to problems"" isn't another way of saying ""inferior"" I don't know what is. Those exact words are in the article and they are what I object to. Your average person is not going to click on the citation and make the judgement ""oh, the trainer is saying this and it might be an old wives tale"" they are going to take it as fact that white feet are more prone to problems. When you can come back with ANY peer reviewed study, even just one, that says that white hooves are softer or more prone to problems, I will shut up. Otherwise you are abusing your privileges here and inserting your own pseudoscience and agenda. I have no agenda here as a ""barefoot movement"" person, because I am not one. My OTTB HAS to wear shoes or her feet fall apart, the other one is barefoot most of the time because she has feet like iron other than the quarter crack which we just manage with strategic trimming and she stays sound. I recognize this as a consequence of genetics, and not hoof color, and I realize that some horses have great hooves, and others are probably going to always need shoes, especially competition horses that have unnatural strain placed on them. As someone who is a scientific professional, I can look at evidence subjectively and not just go by tradition or old wives tales. I can't just go by my own opinions or something that someone told me once that may or may not have any evidence behind it. So again, please provide me with ONE STUDY (not just a person's statement) that shows that white feet are ""more prone to problems"" or ""softer"" and cite those in the article, and I will stop pestering this board.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

Trade journals are still more reputable than your opinion/observations/anecdotes or the superstitious comments of one trainer in a sport full of superstition and tradition. The link that froggerlaura provided indicated only that there was one anomalous white foot in the study. I saw no reference to ""more moisture"" and being softer, so if you would provide a paragraph number I would be appreciative. I'm not arguing that this is an area that has been exhaustively researched and all scientific conclusions have been made, what I am saying is that thus far, all of the results point to there being no difference between colored and white hooves. You have not yet given me any study that disagrees with that (unless you can provide previously mentioned paragraph numbers and they do in fact confirm your moisture statement) so to leave in the statement as written, even later in the paragraph leads most people reading the article to believe that there have been studies that show white feet are inferior, thus perpetuating the myth. The statement doesn't even have any added value to the article, other than to say that he started to have problems with his feet. The whole part about them being white is completely irrelevant.

<user_id=216.227.122.184>
As for my credentials, I have a masters degree in engineering (yes, I have literally taken ""rocket science"" and there are classes that are harder than it, so saying ""it's not rocket science"" is a joke in our field) but I happen to have a background in biology as well and have owned horses my whole life, many of which were OTTBs and were a complete mixed bag of hoof strength even though all of them have had black feet except for the most recent cob cross. If anything, rather than silly rhymes about hoof color, I'd just say don't buy a straight thoroughbred if you want a horse with good feet. And lest you think that I regularly troll the internet spewing my hatred of misinformation, I only came across this when I was looking up info on CC after his loss. I had remembered reading previously that this myth had been debunked, and a quick google search told me that most reputable farriers are no longer telling their clients this, so it bothers me to see it still showing up on places where thousands of people are likely to be influenced by it because they're unlikely to dig any deeper.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=Froggerlaura>
While I agree that more study is warranted in the ""white hoof"" debate, California Chrome is not the right article to either prove or disprove the theory. Since the statement about the hooves is contentious, how about just starting the paragraph as ""While in training, California Chrome has had problems with his feet"" without going into the debate about why.

<user_id=Montanabw>
The American Farrier's Journal is a trade publication, not a ""medical"" journal and Jaime Jackson is a person who espouses fringe views. Perfect horse is John Lyons' publication. I have looked at the studies that are out there, there are a handful.  They indicate, as Froggerlaura noted above, that the structure of white and dark feet is not significantly different: ""no structural differences in the hoof wall keratins.""  But that's as far as they go. One of them does indicate the feet with more moisture are softer and more prone to falling apart. There are no studies that are particularly comprehensive, most have small sample sizes, they don't sound like they used live hoof tissue for some of them and their conclusions are, at best, preliminary.  So your frothing and ranting on the topic is not winning me over here. I am not going to argue about our relative credentials because on the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog. Let's just say that I too can read scientific studies, and I can also see when a ""scientific"" study is not particularly well designed.  If it will placate you, I can switch the order of the paragraph so the hoof structure thing is not what leads it, but that's as far as I am willing to go.  In this case, verifiability is what we have from the sources cited, and no one is saying the horse has weak feet, in fact, the evidence is the opposite.

<user_id=Montanabw>
No one seems to be reading the actual article or the sources cited. He didn't have problems with his feet, other than low heels (which seems to be a common thing n TBs), the point is that they are careful and care well for his feet.  I will do a minor rephrase, but ""superstition"" is not what we are talking about here, and frankly, we've all got advanced degrees, we've probably all taken some biology classes too (and in my case, equine management, FWIW) and yes, I too have ""owned horses all my life."" So I am not impressed by some anonymous IP who ctes a fringe theorist.

<user_id=216.227.122.184>
No one seems to be reading the sources cited is EXACTLY the point I was making. If your average wikipedia reader were to look at this article, they would surmise that white feet are more prone to problems a statement that you are still making in the article even though you have changed the order. I agree with Froggerlaura's recommendation, which makes this debate 2 to 1. If you're going to continue to lord your administrative privileges over me just because I was too lazy to create a wikipedia login (and by the way, my anonymous ip is no more anonymous than a username like Montanabw, I have no qualms providing you a link to my linkedin article to establish who I am since if you're crazy enough to try something violent based on that, you could still find me based on my ip). I ""cited a fringe theorist"" in one article, and while he is an established farrier the other studies does by DVMs that I also linked to back him up, and they are the stronger studies, yet you keep going back to the one study. Unless you are going to say you are a DVM (I'm guessing not or you would have stated as much) last I checked that was the highest qualification for equine practitioners, so unless they all are ""fringe"" you can't dismiss their studies. And I'm still waiting for the one study that says that white hooves are softer that you keep talking about. STUDY not quote please.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=Laurelmw>
Montanabw - what you are describing is the difference between science and belief. Many people believe that white hooves are softer or more prone to problems, but that does not mean that science agrees with that belief. A perfect example is religion: There are many people who believe that the world is only a few thousand years old because the bible says so. Scientific study shows otherwise. We would not include that as a statement in an article about the history of our planet and then link back to a quote from a trade journal (in this case bloodhorse, but in the religion example, some christian publication) or the statement of a trainer (in the religion example, a priest/pastor) because it would be misleading and inaccurate. Currently the science contradicts your statement, and for clarity it should not be included as an implied ""fact"" in this article.

Though his feet have generally been healthy, it is a commonly held belief among horsemen that white hooves can be softer than dark-colored hooves,[15] and are thought to be more prone to developing problems.[18] The scientific studies that have been completed on the subject have thus far shown that there is no difference between white and dark hooves					False

I assume you are the same person as the one with the anonymous IP who engaged in the vicious rant above, implying that I am somehow a person who would do you violence.  Clearly you haven't been here very long or you would not engage in such personal attacks that have pretty much cost you a lot of goodwill from the outset and made you look less than credible. I am not an administrator, and it was third party who warned you about your behavior.  I am not going to engage ina rant about the concept on this article per WP:UNDUE, and to settle the issue I will add precisely what Art Sherman's opinion is and toss the generalized comment, I think I can find a source on that.  But you seriously need to chill out here. And, just so you know, at least one of the other editors on this article IS a DVM, so don't assume you are any smarter than anyone else around.

",1,"The discussion revolves around whether the article should state that white hooves on horses are softer and more prone to problems than dark-colored hooves, a belief held by some horsemen, and whether this belief is supported by scientific evidence.

Chain-of-Thought:

1. **Factual Accuracy**: The debate includes references to scientific studies and personal observations. Some participants cite studies that suggest there is no structural difference between white and dark hooves, while others rely on anecdotal evidence and the opinions of horsemen and farriers. The argument for scientific evidence appears stronger as it is based on studies rather than personal experience.

2. **Relevance**: The discussion is relevant to the article's content, as it pertains to the description of a specific horse, California Chrome, and a broader belief about horse hooves. The participants are debating whether the inclusion of this belief is relevant and supported by evidence.

3. **Coherence**: The arguments are generally coherent, with each participant presenting their viewpoint logically. However, the discussion becomes less coherent as it progresses, with some participants engaging in personal attacks and questioning each other's credentials, which detracts from the quality of the debate.

4. **Civility**: The discussion starts civilly but deteriorates over time, with accusations of edit warring, personal attacks, and implications of violence. This lack of civility undermines the quality of the discussion.

5. **Rhetorical Strategies**: Some participants use rhetorical strategies such as appealing to authority (citing scientific studies and professional qualifications) and slippery slope arguments (comparing the belief about hooves to anti-vaccination beliefs). These strategies are effective to varying degrees but are sometimes overshadowed by the emotional tone of the debate.

6. **Constructiveness**: The discussion includes suggestions for compromise and attempts to find common ground, such as rephrasing the contentious statement. However, these are often overshadowed by the confrontational aspects of the debate.

7. **Resolution**: The discussion does not seem to reach a clear resolution, with participants continuing to disagree on the inclusion and phrasing of the statement about white hooves. The suggestion to move to dispute resolution indicates that the discussion has not been productive in resolving the issue.

Considering the above points, the discussion started with a focus on factual accuracy and relevance but was marred by a decline in coherence and civility, which negatively impacted the overall quality of the arguments. The use of rhetorical strategies and attempts at constructiveness were present but not sufficient to overcome the contentious nature of the debate.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 4.5.",4.5

FDA letter . . .

<user_id=BeenAroundAWhile>
Hello, all: The large amount of space given to  one FDA letter during VanderSloot's rather long life seems to be a good instance of contradicting WP:Undue. Therefore, I am making a subhead for that phase of the article and marking it for attention. I really don't think it should be used at all: It is equivalent to reporting on a speeding ticket that one of his truckdrivers might have received back in 1997. Please comment on whether this section should or should not be deleted.
An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. For example, discussion of isolated events, criticisms, or news reports about a subject may be verifiable and impartial, but still disproportionate to their overall significance to the article topic. This is a concern especially in relation to recent events that may be in the news. Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements.
Thank you.

<user_id=Rhode Island Red>
I disagree that it is unduly weighted. It has been mentioned by secondary sources and is described succinctly in the article and only in as much detail as is necessary to convey the gist. Suggesting that FDA warnings are analogous to a speeding ticket is nothing more than a personal opinion (c.f. WP:OR) and it demonstrates a lack of understating of their significance. It's especially relevant given that VS had a serious run-in with the FDA for similar issues while running Oil of Melaleuca. If anything, you have given it even more weight by offsetting it into a separate section.

<user_id=BeenAroundAWhile>
''Remove the entire item.''' (1) Please read the original posting at the top of this section. (2) The reason the item now has a subheader is so that a tag could be placed on just one particular section. The tag reads: ""An editor has expressed a concern that this section lends undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, controversies or matters relative to the article subject as a whole. Please help to create a more balanced presentation. ''Discuss and resolve this issue before removing this message.'' (Emphasis supplied.)  (3) There is only one Source given for this item, in a trade website. (The other Source is the letter itself, which is not good enough in Wikipedia's eyes to use as a Source alone.) This factoid about Melaleuca was never the object of scrutiny in any other Reliable Source, nor reported on elsewhere. It is therefore ''de minimis.'' It is, given the thousands of products made by Melaleuca, just not worth trifling about. Nor, given the fact that this article is about a Living Person and not a company, does it warrant even a mention in the biography of this man.

<user_id=Andrewman327>
FDA's involvement with Oil of Melaleuca is a big deal.  The 1997 letter is a different matter.  The letter itself states that it is not a reflection of Melaleuca in general, which is how it is being used in this article.  To put it in the proper context, the warning letter would require either a very long explanation or original research, neither of which is appropriate.  The FDA also did not say that the claims were necessarily untrue, since that's beyond its statutory purview.

<user_id=Rhode Island Red>
It doesn't require a long explanation at all. It has a short explanation now and it serves the purpose fine. All the key details are there, the primary and secondary source are linked, and no additional context is necessary. FDA warnings are pretty straightforward and unambiguous. They don't deal with whether or not claims are true; simply whether or not they are legal, and in this case the claims were not legal. DSHEA provides blanket rules specifying what sellers of dietary supplements can and cannot say about their products; when companies break the rules, they get a warning and then fines/sanctioned if they refuse to comply with the order. The FDA warning is relevant and noteworthy enough on its own, but even more so given that VS's previous company had an identical run in with the FDA and received the same type of warning.

<user_id=Collect>
It is ''not'' up to Wikipedia to assert what you seem to wish us to assert.  All supplement companies get FDA letters.  A ""warning"" is of de minimis importance in a BLP.   If you found a fine being paid, that would warrant some WEIGHT, the warning, by itself, is heavily overweighted at this point.

<user_id=Andrewman327>
FDA has a 21 page manual explaining what warning letters are and I stand by what I said about it being too wonky to be able to describe without either making it sound worse than it was or giving the section undue weight. As far as I can tell, FDA has never taken an administrative action against the company.  Even the letter they sent 15 years ago did not apply to the company writ large.

<user_id=BeenAroundAWhile>
It was stated above that the letter ""has been mentioned by secondary sources."" I think'' just one'' secondary source. Is there a consensus to remove the section, or should we seek more input?

<user_id=Andrewman327>
I certainly agree that it should be removed.    —Preceding undated comment added

<user_id=HtownCat>
I'm in agreement as well. The letter is just talking about wording on a product label. Doesn't seem notable.

<user_id=BeenAroundAWhile>
I am removing that section according to what seems like consensus. If there are other editors who want to keep it, then I hope they will weigh in here for a possible new consensus. Thank you.

<user_id=Rhode Island Red>
Sorry, but I don't buy any consensus based on a voting block exclusively from WP Project Conservatism, and especially not a consensus based on  simple ""me too"" comments and WP:OR. This is a chronic problem that needs to be addressed with the admins if it continues. FDA warning letters are indeed significant and highly notable. Your assertion to the contrary is WP:OR. The warning letter IS an administrative action.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Argument for Removal (BeenAroundAWhile)**: The argument is based on the Wikipedia policy WP:Undue, which states that an article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject but should treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance. The user argues that the FDA letter is given too much weight in the article, comparing it to a minor incident like a speeding ticket. The user also notes that the section has been tagged for attention due to concerns about balance.

2. **Argument against Removal (Rhode Island Red)**: The counter-argument is that the FDA warning is significant and has been mentioned by secondary sources. The user also points out that the FDA warning is relevant given the subject's history with the FDA. The user disagrees with the comparison to a speeding ticket and believes that the FDA warning is a serious matter.

3. **Argument for Removal (Andrewman327)**: This user agrees with the removal, stating that the FDA letter does not reflect on the company as a whole and that explaining it properly would require either a long explanation or original research, which is not appropriate for Wikipedia.

4. **Argument against Removal (Rhode Island Red)**: The user reiterates that FDA warnings are significant and that the explanation in the article is sufficient. They also emphasize the relevance of the warning due to the subject's previous run-ins with the FDA.

5. **Argument for Removal (Collect)**: This user argues that FDA letters are common for supplement companies and that a warning is of minimal importance in a biography of a living person (BLP). They suggest that unless there was a fine paid, the warning should not be given much weight.

6. **Argument for Removal (HtownCat)**: This user agrees with the removal, stating that the letter is about wording on a product label and does not seem notable.

7. **Argument against Removal (Rhode Island Red)**: The user challenges the consensus, stating that the significance of FDA warning letters is being downplayed and that the letter is indeed an administrative action.

The quality of the arguments varies. Those arguing for removal are primarily concerned with the proportionality of the content in relation to the subject's biography and the application of Wikipedia's policies on undue weight and notability. Those against removal are focused on the significance of FDA warnings and the subject's history with the FDA, which they believe justifies the inclusion of the content.

Overall, the arguments for removal seem to be more aligned with Wikipedia's policies on balance and notability, while the arguments against removal rely on the inherent significance of FDA warnings without fully addressing the concerns about undue weight in the context of the subject's biography.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7. The discussion is robust, with both sides presenting relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines, but the arguments for removal are slightly more in line with Wikipedia's standards for content balance.",7.0
"<user_id=Yobol>
Sources used for medical information, in any article, is governed by WP:MEDRS (""specific attention given to sources appropriate for the medical and health-related content in any type of article"").  Since the section you are adding the information to the ""Nutritional value and taste"" section is obviously health related, so sources used in this section need to meet WP:MEDRS.  The source you want to use, published here has multiple problems. The journal is not MEDLINE indexed, which is a huge red flag for medical journals.  The journal's stated scope is ""the areas of cell biology, plant pathology and physiology, genetics, classical botany, and ecology, to practical agricultural applications""; it specifically is not a journal that published medical information.  Using a journal that is out of its stated scope to rebut information from journals that are in medical journals is not appropriate.

<user_id=Montanabw>
When supposedly ""rigorous"" studies are wholly funded by major corporations such as Monsanto, that too is suspicious.  It's remarkably easy to have a university researcher to publish favorable results  with unlimited funding.  We may also need to add some of the political issues as well.

<user_id=Montanabw>
MEDRS is not required for an article such as this one, which is within the scope of WIkiProject Agriculture.  WP:RS is all that is needed; peer-reviewed journals are fine, university published sources are fine.  Limiting source material to MEDRS would unnecessarily restrict reliable information on this topic.  It makes about as much sense as requiring a MEDRS source for citing info on the death of John Lennon

<user_id=The Banner>
Nasty question: can you prove that the source we rely on, are really independent and neutral? Did you notice that ''every time'' there is a favourable report about organic food, it is followed by a report discrediting it? Strange at least.

<user_id=The Banner>
I would say that food quality and food nutrition is an agricultural concern, not exclusively a medical one.

<user_id=The Banner>
Monsanto into organic food? I don't think so. GMO is absolutely prohibited in organic production. Just look at the organic standards (at least the European ones)   Potential COI: I grow vegetables, non-organic.

<user_id=Second Quantization>
For future reference, the same food large companies make both organic and non-organic produce; organic food is highly profitable.

<user_id=Yobol>
No. The supposed health and safety effects are a major reason why people consume organic foods; flat out removal of the section is grossly inappropriate.  If there are problems with WP:DUE, it can be addressed without ignoring the topic.  Hand-waving objections about conspiracies by corporations are probably not going to go anywhere.

<user_id=Yobol>
Just a couple of comments to The Banner: 1) Pubmed is an international indexing, not an American one (as would be clear to anyone who searched the index for journals with the word ""British"" in the title - hundreds of results come up).  2) We should be using medical journals for medical information, and agricultural journals for agricultural information. I would have the same objection if someone tried to use the The New England Journal of Medicine or BMJ for purely agricultural info.

<user_id=The Banner>
Perhaps it would be better to remove the whole section ""Health and Safety"". First, scientifically it is a battleground. Second, the massive food industry will weigh in with their money, paying for scientific research that has a WP:COI. Third, the exclusion of sources, giving undue weight to the medical side of the story.

<user_id=The Banner>
Yes, on a second look it did not seem to be very reliable. But the part I added was based on a university study by an agricultural department. Not so likely to be included in een medical index, but, as far as I can tell, not an unreliable source, certainly not in its field of expertise.

<user_id=Second Quantization>
factorfizzle.com appears to be self-published,

<user_id=The Banner>
So you lock out loads of scientific sources, even agricultural science, as soon as it contains health claims? That you need reliable sources, true. That there is a load of garbage disguised als articles, true. But starting to measure ONLY along the lines of a notorious difficult accessible medical index, makes no sense. That gives undue weight to the medical side of the article.

<user_id=Bobrayner>
It's inevitable that an article on organic food will touch on health - since nutrition (or avoiding consumption of pesticides &c;) is often perceived to be an advantage of organic food. It's reasonable to expect a MEDRS for that kind of content, especially due to the neutrality problems in this area (there are lots of lower-quality sources making very dubious claims). Outside that - say, content about farming techniques or the economic side - then of course we don't need a MEDRS.

<user_id=Jytdog>
Just FYI - Monsanto has a big line of vegetable seeds that are not genetically modified.  They breed new varieties that are valuable to conventional as well as organic growers.

<user_id=Montanabw>
I think the issue is here is a debate to use only MEDRS versus WP:RS.  There is no need for there to only be MEDRS sources here to the exclusion of other material that will pass WP:RS.  My point is that peer-reviewed literature and studies that appear in such sources are often not supportive of alternative views, and a lot of mainstream research is funded from corporate sources.  Thus, particularly in fields such as this one, to limit sources to only things that appear in Pubmed will, inherently, create a POV bias that is not appropriate for a comprehensive article, leaving behind only an anti-organic, pro-corporate agriculture viewpoint that defeats the intent of wikipedia and the NPOV pillar.

<user_id=The Banner>
WP:MEDRS

<user_id=Bobrayner>
I don't think that our editing should be governed by such conspiracy theories. Got sources?

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **MEDRS vs. RS**: The primary point of contention in this discussion is whether the medical sourcing guidelines (WP:MEDRS) should be strictly applied to an article that falls under the scope of WikiProject Agriculture. Some participants argue that MEDRS is necessary for health-related claims, while others believe that WP:RS (general reliable sourcing) is sufficient for an agriculture-focused article. This is a valid debate, as it touches on the interdisciplinary nature of the topic (agriculture and health).

2. **Scope of Journals**: There is a discussion about the appropriateness of using certain types of journals for specific information. One side argues that agricultural journals may not be suitable for medical claims, while the other side suggests that agricultural journals can provide reliable information on food quality and nutrition. This reflects an understanding of the importance of source relevance and expertise.

3. **Independence and Neutrality of Sources**: Concerns are raised about the independence and neutrality of sources, especially those funded by corporations like Monsanto. This is a legitimate concern in academic research, where funding sources can influence outcomes. The discussion reflects awareness of potential conflicts of interest and the need for critical evaluation of sources.

4. **Conspiracy Theories**: There is a mention of conspiracy theories regarding the suppression of positive information about organic food. While it's important to be aware of potential biases in research, the argument is not substantiated with evidence within the discussion, which weakens the overall quality of the argument.

5. **Economic Interests**: The profitability of organic food and the involvement of large companies in both organic and non-organic produce is mentioned. This is relevant to the discussion as it highlights the complexity of the organic food industry and potential biases in research funding.

6. **Exclusion of Sections**: The suggestion to remove the ""Health and Safety"" section due to it being a ""battleground"" is a drastic measure that may not be in line with Wikipedia's goal of providing comprehensive information. The discussion around this reflects a tension between presenting contentious information and maintaining neutrality.

7. **DUE Weight**: There is a concern about giving undue weight to the medical side of the article by relying heavily on medical indexes. This is a valid point, as Wikipedia aims to present a balanced view of topics, and over-reliance on one type of source could skew the perspective.

Overall, the discussion shows a range of perspectives and a good understanding of Wikipedia's sourcing policies. Participants are engaged in a substantive debate about the relevance and reliability of sources, the intersection of agriculture and health, and the potential biases in research. However, the discussion is somewhat weakened by unsubstantiated claims of conspiracy and the suggestion to remove entire sections of content.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.0",7.0

France

<user_id=Langus-TxT>
We need evidence of renewed French support, or else we should note that France was supportive to the British position during the Falklands War. I looked for news but I found none.

<user_id=Kahastok>
I would note that trying to apply the same standards to a country whose interested is in having support for its position being affirmed at every opportunity and a country whose interest is in the thing getting as little publicity as possible is fairly obviously unreasonable.  It should be expected in this context that support for Britain will be more subtly expressed.  In this case, France ratified the Treaty of Lisbon and has never argued the Argentine position.  Unlike countries like Spain, this is an example of a country - and major player, member of the P5 - whose viewpoint we can pin down as consistent. '''' ''''

<user_id=Gaba p>
I could not find any current mention of France's position either, that's why I proposed the edit. Can any other editor produce a reference where France supports the British claim in present days (or a couple of years old)? If not the sentence needs to be re-phrased so as to not mislead the reader. Regards.

<user_id=Gaba p>
We are not applying any standards here. France is mentioned as currently supporting the British position with no source to back the statement. This needs to be fixed by either re-phrasing the sentence or adding a source, simple. If you believe we can pin down France's view as ""consistent"" then please provide a source so we can do so.

<user_id=Gaba p>
I note the use of the word ""particularly"" in the current statement which is a clear WP:PEACOCK term. Regards.

<user_id=Kahastok>
I do not accept your claim that you are applying a standard - you're applying a standard that suggests that support for the British position will be expressed in the same way as support for the Argentine position.  This is not a reasonable assumption. '''' ''''

<user_id=Langus-TxT>
I disagree with Kahastok's view that ratifying the Treaty of Lisbon and not contesting Argentina's claim is enough to say that a country ""has been particularly supportive of the British position"". I note also that the two references included in that expression refer to the Falkands War, so I'm applying a 'failed verification' tag. Kahastok, is in your hands now to bring a secondary source backing your opinion.

<user_id=Gaba p>
Kahastok this is '''an encyclopedia'''. What we do is write articles with relevant and properly sourced information. If a vast number of countries choose to be more vocal about their support for the Argentinian position, it is not our position to apply some ""standard"" and obscure mentions of this support just because other countries are not doing the same for the UK claim.
As this source clearly states  the EU remains neutral about the Falklands/Malvinas issue and the fact that the islands are included in the Lisbon treaty is ""''merely descriptive''"" and even more ""''This does not imply acknowledgement of UK sovereignty over the Falklands/Malvinas by EU members. This must be defined bilaterally between the UK and Argentina''"".
Seeing that the Lisbon treaty '''does not''' imply support for the UK position, the mention of France as stated in the article is currently 100% wrong. The edit proposed here is much more accurate and I've yet to see a reason by Kahastok as to why it shouldn't be added. I'll await some reason or else simply make the edit. Regards.

<user_id=Wee Curry Monster>
Could you please justify the reason for that tag, as on p.166 of Gustafson, Gustafson states that ""France has been particularly vocal in its support for Britain"", I'm paraphrasing rather than quoting directly.  And could you explain why we need ""renewed evidence"", since we have reliable sources stating that France has supported the UK and as you advocate that we're not allowed to question reliable sources by our own original research.  Speculating that French support of a close ally has changed is of course your original research and demanding we prove a negative is of course impossible.  Equally, you appear to apply a double standard in that countries that have been equivocal in supporting any one country you appear to insist we state as unconditionally supporting Argentina based on one source, whilst ignoring others which indicate the oppposite.  I would be grateful if you could outline your logic in selecting which source to use in that respect.

<user_id=Langus-TxT>
''@WCM:''' Leaving aside the ''original paraphrasing'', you should note that Gustafson's book is dated 1988. It's been 25 years since. ""Has been"" implies continuity up to today: see present perfect continuous. When Gustafson uses the expression, you should read ""Up to 1988, France has been..."".
You said: ''""since we have reliable sources stating that France has supported the UK""''. We agree on that: we do have RS stating that France has supported the UK. But we don't have RS stating that France '''has been''' supportive to the UK (remember: present perfect continuous + January 2013 although a source dated 2003 would still be acceptable). Per WP:BURDEN, it's not up to me to bring secondary sources saying that now things have change.

<user_id=Langus-TxT>
May I suggest switching the past tense as shown above? I think that would settle it.

<user_id=Wee Curry Monster>
For info see

<user_id=Wee Curry Monster>
As has been pointed out Britain doesn't demand a statement in support every week, so why would there be regular and continuous statements of support?  It doesn't matter that a book is dated 1988,  its been regularly reprinted and the author has seen no need to revise it.  You are conducting original research through speculation that things ''might'' have changed and demanding a different burden of proof should apply.  The statement should reflect the source, that is all, we should not be interpreting it as you wish to do.  If we go back to a previous example, I questioned the use of Lopez as a cite, noting that Lopez claimed Goebel supported his hypothesis.  I simply pointed out that Goebel did not and questioned your insistence on the use of Lopez, at which point you were adamant I could not use WP:COMMON but had to knowingly repeat a false claim verbatim.  On that occasion you were absolutely adamant I couldn't question a source but here again you're using your own speculation as sufficient reason.  I'm struggling to see the logic, consistency of approach or the justification for the tag you applied, since the source verifies the statement and you've given no sustainable reason for adding it.  If you cannot, then I request you remove it.

<user_id=Gaba p>
The sentence implies current support when the sources do not. The book is 25 years old and the article talks about support during the 1982 war (31 years have passed). I've changed the tag to one I believe to be more precise, please tell me if I'm mistaken. Once again: we either come up with a current source stating France's support or we re-phrase the statement. Regards.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The main point of contention is whether France's support for the British position on the Falklands War is current and ongoing, or if it was only relevant during the time of the war. The argument hinges on the interpretation of the phrase ""has been particularly supportive.""

2. User Langus-TxT argues that the sources cited are outdated (from 1988 and referring to events in 1982) and do not provide evidence of continuous support up to the present day. This user suggests that the use of the present perfect continuous tense in the phrase implies ongoing action, which is not substantiated by current sources.

3. User Kahastok counters that it is unreasonable to expect that France would express its support in the same manner as countries supporting Argentina, implying that a lack of recent explicit statements does not necessarily indicate a change in position.

4. User Gaba p points out that the EU's neutrality on the Falklands/Malvinas issue, as stated in the Lisbon Treaty, contradicts the claim of France's support for the UK's position. This user emphasizes the need for accurate and properly sourced information in the encyclopedia.

5. User Wee Curry Monster argues that the lack of a need for continuous statements of support from Britain does not imply a change in France's stance. This user also suggests that the reliability of a source is not diminished by its age if the source has been regularly reprinted and not revised.

6. The discussion involves a debate over the interpretation of sources, the relevance of the age of sources, and the standards of evidence required to claim a country's support in a geopolitical issue.

7. All participants are engaging with the topic seriously and are providing reasoned arguments based on their interpretation of Wikipedia's guidelines and the available evidence.

Based on the chain-of-thought reasoning, the discussion is thorough, with all parties presenting valid points based on Wikipedia's policies and the interpretation of sources. The participants are focused on the accuracy and verifiability of the information, which is crucial for an encyclopedia. The debate is civil, and each user is attempting to clarify their position and the rationale behind it.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.",8.0

NPOV Sections

<user_id=Whisperwolf>
I have added two NPOV-Section tags to this article, in two places where there are direct links offsite to papers specifically written by John Lott, hosted on a site that I am not sure has recognition with Wikipedia as being a credibly neutral site for information.  Given that the articles directly expand on the short additions to Wikipedia that link to them, it would appear that this is an attempt at self-promotion rather than abiding by the NPOV rules of Wikipedia.  That is the reason I have added these tags.

<user_id=Whisperwolf>
On further reading of the entire article I have nominated this article for a POV-check since there are a lot of occasions where it is stated ""Lott found..."" as if his own research results should be taken as fully accurate.  Since there is evident political bias in some of the items I do consider that the balance of the article overall is straying away from NPOV and would therefore invite discussion as to the overall neutrality of this article.  While I accept that ""(researcher) found"" can be accurate in some cases, since there is obvious political bias and some of Lott's work is controversial, I feel it is inappropriate for such terms to be used with the frequency that they are in this article, without some balance of opposite political views.

<user_id=Serenity~enwiki>
First, these are published academic articles.  The abortion article was published in the economics journal Economic Inquiry.  Second, if there is subsequent academic research that directly comments on this research you can cite it and state what it claims.  Third, the statements saying ""Lott found . . ."" seems unbiased.  It is stating that ""Lott"" had found the finding.  It is not saying that all academics state the same finding.  Finally, other posting by other academics are written in similar ways  see the postings on Steven Levitt.

<user_id=Whisperwolf>
While I can appreciate what you say on the subject of ""Lott found..."" I still feel that to link directly to his papers crosses the line of WP:NOR which specifically states:
Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources. All interpretive claims, analyses, or synthetic claims about primary sources must be referenced to a secondary source, rather than original analysis of the primary-source material by Wikipedia editors.
Primary sources that have been published by a reliable source may be used in Wikipedia, but only with care, because it is easy to misuse them. For that reason, anyone—without specialist knowledge—who reads the primary source should be able to verify that the Wikipedia passage agrees with the primary source. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation. To the extent that part of an article relies on a primary source, it should:
only make descriptive claims about the information found in the primary source, the accuracy and applicability of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge, and
make no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, explanatory, or evaluative claims about the information found in the primary source.
Clearly in directly linking to a paper rather than having a reference link to a third party reliable source, this section breaches Wikipedia's Guidelines.  If something was published elsewhere, and that elsewhere is a credible source, then the article here should link to that credible source, not direct to the paper.

<user_id=Threepillars>
I'm trying to decide what to do with the section on Lott et al. researching media bias. The whole paragraph is poorly written. For instance, what does ""how to objectively measure what the actual news story was"" even mean? I guess they mean they are measuring something about an ''event'' covered by a newspaper, but what about it was measured?

The links to John Lott's papers ought to be included, but preferably as a regular reference (citing the actual publication info, with a link to where they can be read).  The main problem that WP:NPOV warns against is interpretation of the primary source; as long as we're not doing that, there's no issue with citing these papers, because that's where most of the debate remains. ws

",0,"The discussion revolves around the neutrality and appropriate citation of content related to John Lott's work on Wikipedia. The participants are debating the use of primary sources, the direct linking to Lott's papers, the phrasing of findings, and the verification of Lott's professional positions.

<user_id=Whisperwolf> raises concerns about neutrality and self-promotion by directly linking to John Lott's papers, which could be seen as a violation of Wikipedia's No Original Research policy. They argue that the frequency of ""Lott found..."" without presenting opposing views may not be neutral.

<user_id=Serenity~enwiki> counters by stating that the papers are published in academic journals and suggests adding counterpoints if available. They defend the use of ""Lott found..."" as a neutral way of presenting Lott's findings.

<user_id=Threepillars> comments on the clarity and quality of writing in a specific section, suggesting that it may need to be cut if it cannot be clarified.

<user_id=Spangineer> agrees that Lott's papers should be cited but recommends using standard reference formats and ensuring that there is no interpretation of the primary source, which would align with Wikipedia's guidelines.

<user_id=Johndoeemail> provides a series of citations to verify Lott's professional positions, showing diligence in adhering to Wikipedia's verification standards. However, they seem to be unfamiliar with creating new sections and the proper formatting of citations.

<user_id=ImperfectlyInformed> suggests a minor change in language from ""Lott found"" to ""Lott concluded"" to improve the perceived neutrality of the phrasing.

The quality of the arguments varies. <user_id=Whisperwolf> presents a well-reasoned argument about the importance of neutrality and adherence to Wikipedia's policies. <user_id=Serenity~enwiki> and <user_id=Spangineer> provide counterarguments that focus on the acceptability of academic sources and the proper way to cite them. <user_id=Threepillars> brings up a valid point about the clarity of writing, which is crucial for Wikipedia articles. <user_id=Johndoeemail> shows a strong effort in providing citations, although they lack familiarity with Wikipedia's formatting rules. <user_id=ImperfectlyInformed> offers a simple yet effective suggestion for improving neutrality.

Overall, the discussion is constructive, with participants providing evidence and suggestions to improve the article.

Deliberate Ambiguity

<user_id=2.28.175.64>
TheOldJacobite obviously doesn't understand the concept of deliberate ambiguity as he keeps changing the analysis to make it seem like a straight-up story with no extra layers. I've reported him for repeatedly reverting it without adequate explanation, as well as his abrasive, arrogant refusal to accept anyone else's contribution to the page.

<user_id=TheOldJacobite>
The plot is not the place for analysis or commentary, it is the place for a straight recitation of the facts.  If you have a source for this ""deliberate ambiguity,"" the proper place for it would be in critical reception.  But your opinion is irrelevant and should not be added to the article. -''''''''''

<user_id=Nymf>
+1 on that. It does not really belong under ""plot"", and it would need a proper source. Anything else is original research.\

<user_id=2.28.174.162>
TheOldJacobite - first of all, it isn't your place to tell me that my opinion is irrelevant. You've given me no reason to believe yours is any worthier than mine, none whatsoever.

<user_id=2.28.174.162>
Second, this isn't about MY opinion. It's established, known fact that it's deliberately ambiguous. It's actually noticeable from the analysis as it stands that it has ambiguity, hence the apartment suddenly being empty and the boss who's had dinner with Paul.

<user_id=Grapple X>
What you're trying to do is add subjective information with no sourcing to back it up. When it's being removed, it's being rightly removed—content should be sourced to a reliable secondary source, ''especially'' something so subjective as interpretation of something implied. Instead of gurning about it, find a source to back your opinion up, and if you can't, just drop it. Now you've already broken WP:3RR in warring over this, so back off and spend the time trying to be constructive for a change. Thanks.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User <user_id=2.28.175.64> accuses TheOldJacobite of not understanding the concept of deliberate ambiguity and reports him for reverting edits without adequate explanation. The user also complains about TheOldJacobite's attitude. However, the user does not provide evidence or sources to support the claim of deliberate ambiguity in the content being discussed.

2. User <user_id=TheOldJacobite> responds by stating that the plot section of an article should only contain a recitation of the facts and that any analysis or commentary should be sourced and placed in the critical reception section. This argument is based on Wikipedia's guidelines for content structure and the need for verifiability.

3. User <user_id=Nymf> supports TheOldJacobite's position, emphasizing the need for proper sourcing and the avoidance of original research, which aligns with Wikipedia's content policies.

4. User <user_id=2.28.174.162> (presumably the same as <user_id=2.28.175.64>) responds with an ad hominem attack on TheOldJacobite, questioning his authority and worthiness. This does not contribute to the argument's substance and fails to address the issue of sourcing and Wikipedia policy.

5. User <user_id=2.28.174.162> continues by asserting that the deliberate ambiguity is an established fact and that it is evident from the current analysis. However, the user still does not provide any sources to substantiate this claim.

6. User <user_id=Grapple X> reinforces the need for sourced content and warns <user_id=2.28.174.162> about the violation of Wikipedia's Three-Revert Rule (WP:3RR), which is a policy designed to prevent edit warring. This user also encourages constructive behavior and the use of reliable secondary sources.

Overall, the arguments from TheOldJacobite, Nymf, and Grapple X are based on Wikipedia's guidelines and policies, emphasizing the importance of verifiability and proper sourcing. They maintain a focus on the procedural aspects of content editing. On the other hand, the arguments from <user_id=2.28.175.64>/<user_id=2.28.174.162> lack evidence and are more emotional and confrontational, which detracts from the discussion quality.

Original research

<user_id=Dr. Vicodine>
Next match day scenarios are not referenced and are a violation of WP:NOR.

<user_id=87.212.203.152>
Disagree. It's purely mathematical, it does not require references, as anyone can calculate and correct it themselves. E.g. 2+2=4 is not a statement that's original research or would require references either. They're fun, harmless and remove themselves over time, anyway.

<user_id=68.44.73.17>
Yes, Heaven forbid the site have useful information.

<user_id=Stigni>
I agree with you if you said that is math, but it is not simple math. I study math at University, and if some one ask me what is simple math what I have to answer? If I say that some ODE is simple someone can argue that is not, but for me is not too hard. For this calculation you have to see all the matches from now to the end, valuate the tiebreaker criteria, look when a team is qualify or not, so the math beyond it is ""simple"", is only sum, but all the working with that is not, in particularly the hth criteria. So it is WP:NOR, and there also the problem of WP:CRYSTAL: ''Articles that present original research in the form of extrapolation, speculation, and ""future history"" are inappropriate.'' And how you can tell that a section that start with ''On the '''next''' matchday'' is not a extrapolation, speculation, and ""future history""?

<user_id=Stigni>
Being a useful information is not quite for Wikipedia standard. If is not a verificable data it will not be put on any article.

<user_id=Motsjo>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OR#Routine_calculations
What about this? I really don't see why the next matchday sections have to be removed now. They've been there for as long as I can remember, and technically they are just basic additions. They also provide an easy way to look up the various scenarios for all the groups and teams. I say we have a vote on this.

<user_id=Schnapper>
Disagree too. I love Wikipedia's football related articles for their clear and good loking information and particularly for the next matchday scenarios. I spent a lot oftime to make the scenarios which were unashamedly deleteted today. Where is the respect? Those are scenario calculations based on official sources (the tie-breakig rules) so everything is verifiable. Show some respect to the authors!!

<user_id=87.212.203.152>
It's quite easily verifiable. As said, it's basic math. It's just that the additions aren't referenced from an outside source. To me that seems taking policy way too literal and applying it for the sake of application.

<user_id=Stigni>
I agree with you, but see this.

<user_id=Sven Manguard>
I have reverted the change back. You cannot simply ignore long held practices because you don't like them. Get consensus first if you're going to do something like that.

<user_id=Sven Manguard>
And Dr. Vicodine, this is inappropriate. While it's good that you finally seem to have realized that the policy on edit warring does in fact apply to you, replacing one battleground behavior with another one isn't going to spare you any grief from the rest of the people that have to deal with you, indeed it will only make you look more intractable and reduce people's willingness to tolerate your presence on the project.

<user_id=Stigni>
I posted it on Football project and no one answer it as I said on my first comment here, so don't tell me that i have to reach a consensus when no one answer to my post on WP:FOOTY. It is not the first time that is said that is against the WP:NOR, indeed on all the league is always deleted, why this practice is accepted with CL and not on the Leagues' pages? The basic arithmetics is what can do my grandma with a calculator; not if you have to think about it and do all cases, this is NOT basic arithmetics!! And verificable means that exist a third part article that said this, so usually you can find ref for the LAST matchday scenario, and so it is ok, but if you cannot find a ref, any kind of it, it is not verificable; see also WP:GNG. I am a mathematician so I also like the next matchday scenario but Wikipedia is not the place for that.

<user_id=Motsjo>
This is borderline ridiculous. If the simple math that is adding three, one, or zero points to a tally is considered original research, then there would have to be a lot of other practices discontinued. You couldn't pronounce a soccer team as the winner of a league, for example, before every game had been played. Yet this is done on every league page on Wikipedia, using the very same rules that are being discussed here.

<user_id=Stigni>
Yes but it has ref or anyway you can find a ref without any problem... Can you find ref that say exactly what you try to put on this article? It is simple math say that Man Uni is first to his group, with 12 pts and the second at 4 pts with two match to be played, and there is also a lot of ref (e.g.    and so on).

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Dr. Vicodine** raises a concern about the next match day scenarios being original research, which is a violation of Wikipedia's no original research policy (WP:NOR). This is a valid point as Wikipedia requires verifiable and referenced content.

2. **87.212.203.152** counters by arguing that the scenarios are based on simple mathematics, which can be verified by anyone, and therefore do not constitute original research. This argument is somewhat weak because it overlooks the complexity of the scenarios and the need for reliable sources as per Wikipedia's guidelines.

3. **68.44.73.17** makes a more emotional appeal, suggesting that the site should contain useful information, but does not address the policy issue directly. This argument is weak in the context of Wikipedia's standards.

4. **Stigni** provides a more nuanced argument, pointing out that while the math may be simple, the process of considering all matches, tiebreaker criteria, and qualifications is not straightforward. Stigni also brings up the WP:CRYSTAL policy, which prohibits speculation about the future. This is a strong argument as it directly addresses the policy concerns and the complexity of the issue.

5. **Motsjo** references a Wikipedia policy that allows for routine calculations, suggesting that the next matchday scenarios should be allowed. This is a reasonable argument, but it does not fully address the concerns about speculation and the need for references.

6. **Schnapper** argues that the scenarios are based on official sources and thus verifiable, and appeals to respect for the authors' work. While the emotional appeal is weak, the point about verifiability is more substantial. However, it still does not address the need for third-party references.

7. **Sven Manguard** emphasizes the importance of consensus and established practices on Wikipedia, suggesting that changes should not be made unilaterally. This is a strong argument in the context of Wikipedia's collaborative nature.

8. **Stigni** again emphasizes the need for third-party references and the distinction between simple arithmetic and more complex calculations that involve multiple variables and scenarios. This reinforces the argument against including the next matchday scenarios without proper references.

9. **Motsjo** makes a comparison to other practices on Wikipedia, such as declaring a soccer team the winner of a league, which also involves similar calculations. This argument is somewhat persuasive but still does not address the core issue of referencing and speculation.

Overall, the arguments vary in quality. Some participants make strong points regarding Wikipedia's policies and the need for verifiable content, while others rely more on emotional appeals or overlook the complexity of the issue. The discussion includes both policy-based reasoning and practical considerations, with some participants showing a deeper understanding of Wikipedia's guidelines.

"<user_id=Elvenscout742>
Official UK title

<user_id=Elvenscout742>
I have been reverted several times by two different users on this. I now need to provide my justification here for what should have been an uncontroversial edit.
The film is officially licensed for distribution in the UK and Ireland by Eureka. They released the film on DVD under the title ''Ugetsu Monogatari'' and then later re-released it on Blu-Ray under the same title. In this, they are following the usage of the BFI, the previous distributor of the film on VHS
The film does not appear to have been referred to as ''Ugetsu'' (without the second word) in official British or Irish sources since at least 1998. '''''PLEASE''''' do not remove this again: ''Ugetsu'' is the American title; ''Ugetsu Monogatari'' is the British title.

<user_id=JoshuSasori>
It wasn't removed from the article, it was put under ""release/home media"".

<user_id=Elvenscout742>
The statement that this is the official (and implicitly best-known) title in the UK and Ireland was removed, and the wording implied that the film was not known by this title before 2008, but it was available on VHS (from a different company) under the same title in 1998. Prominent variant titles belong in the intro for clarification purposes. As an Irishman I was not familiar with the American title of this Japanese film until I read it on Wikipedia. ''The Avengers'' (2012 film) gives the UK title in the '''''opening sentence''''', even though that film is American and is known throughout the world by its American title; this is a ''Japanese'' film that is known as ''Ugetsu'' in America, but as ''Ugetsu Monogatari'' in its country of origin and in several English-speaking countries.

<user_id=Kauffner>
This issue relates to the RM and is likely to be of far less interest to readers than it is to editors. It certainly doesn't belong in the lead. Also, the word ""officially"" doesn't convey any additional information; It is a WP:PEACOCK word. If ''Ugetsu Monogatari'' is the name used to refer to this film in Britain, that does not support the proposed title of Ugetsu (film).

<user_id=Elvenscout742>
It only relates to the RM in so far as the current title of the article is ''not'' the title by which the film is known either officially or casually in the UK and Ireland. When have I ever said that the official title of the film in UK and Ireland supported the title being changed to Ugetsu (film)?? If I had ''my'' way, this article would be titled according to the way I first learned about the film, and not in this silly ""abbreviate the Japanese title"" that seems to be quite common in North America. (Admittedly, the latter film is known as ''Kuroneko'' in UK as well, that is why I have not mentioned any variant title on that article.) However, I understand that ''my'' way is unreasonable given that this film is known in some English-speaking countries as ''Ugetsu'' and the article has always had this title as a result. This is why my above RM relates exclusively to this film being disambiguated from the far more famous book of the same name, and does not attempt to move the article to its Japanese/British/Irish title. Your attempt, despite this, to read bad faith into my edits to the article has been noted. Why is it a peacock word to mention that the film's official release title in several English-speaking countries is the same as the Japanese one? Surely by calling the article by its ""official"" American title you are doing the same thing?

<user_id=Elvenscout742>
Additionally, it might be pointed out that the Eureka page provides yet another literal/accurate translation of the Japanese title (as a gloss for the meaning of the title, not saying ""this applies only to the film and not to the book"", or acting as an ""official UK title""): ''Tales of the Rain and the Moon''.

<user_id=Ribbet32>
Official implies it's official, as if decreed by law or something. I've left the British ""alternate title"" in the intro but changed the wording.

<user_id=Elvenscout742>
I didn't actually want to say ""official"" originally, I wanted to say ""is sold as"", but this seemed inappropriate. Additionally, the UK title is every bit as official as the American title, since the American title also was not thought up by the film-makers, but rather by an independent distributor.

<user_id=JoshuSasori>
Elvenscout742 has already vandalized this page to make a point, by moving the page then changing the redirect to Tales of Moonlight and Rain without making the slightest effort to relink any of the then-mislinked pages. This addition of the UK title, his reverting of consensus, and endless nitpicking argumentativeness on the talk pages, is yet more of the same outrageous behaviour that he has exhibited elsewhere.

<user_id=Ribbet32>
Regarding this: - Elven, boy, am I getting tired of you.  But actually, if you're making a claim in an article, the burden is on '''you''' to provide the source.  I'm not going to revert again, but I'll ask someone else to, and ask that we can build a consensus on this.

<user_id=Elvenscout742>
Wow, I didn't think you would resort to name-calling this fast. Anyway, there is no need for me to cite three or more sources, or to build consensus. You are working against a clear Wikipedia guideline here, as outlined below.
By the way, I thought I could get this through peacefully with logical debate and reasoning, without having to rely on MOS, etc. My change has stood for a few hours and it looks like this might be over, but I should probably point out for posterity that WP:NCF is very clearly on my side here:
'Use the title more commonly recognized by English readers; normally this means the title under which it has been released in cinemas or on video in the English-speaking world. Normally, this will be an English language title that is recognized across the English-speaking world; however, sometimes different English-speaking countries use different titles, in which case use the most common title, and give the native and alternate English title(s) afterward.''

<user_id=Ribbet32>
What name calling?  Anyway, your quote below doesn't really help you. It says the title under which it is released is ""normally"" the most commonly recognized, but not always.  You have a source saying the movie's been released under a title in Britain, but not that that's the best-known title; it is pretty reasonable that the wording be altered to reflect this.  I can see why you have ""no need"" for consensus, though. So far consensus has not been your friend.

<user_id=JoshuSasori>
I too do not understand what ""name-calling"" refers to.

<user_id=Elvenscout742>
Sorry, my screen was dusty and I didn't notice the comma in your comment, so I read it as "" Elven boy, am I getting tired of you"". I have sources that say the film has been released three separate times under the title ''Ugetsu Monogatari'', and I have not seen any evidence that the film has ever been released under any other title in the UK in the last 50 years. It is ''obviously'' the most widely-known title, since it is the only title under which the film is commercially available.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **<user_id=Elvenscout742>** presents a detailed argument for using the title ""Ugetsu Monogatari"" as the official UK title for the film, citing the distributor Eureka and historical usage by the BFI. The user emphasizes the consistency of this title in the UK and Ireland and compares it to the usage of titles in other Wikipedia articles. The argument is fact-based and appeals to the Wikipedia guideline of using the most common title in English-speaking countries.

2. **<user_id=JoshuSasori>** responds by stating the location of the information within the article but does not directly address the argument about the title's prominence or correctness.

3. **<user_id=Kauffner>** argues that the issue is not of high interest to readers and should not be in the lead. The user also criticizes the use of the word ""officially"" as peacock language. However, this response does not directly counter the evidence provided by Elvenscout742 about the title's usage in the UK.

4. **<user_id=Elvenscout742>** defends the use of ""official"" and reiterates the point that the title is as official in the UK as the American title is in the US. The user also points out that their intention is not to change the article's title but to clarify the title's usage in different English-speaking regions.

5. **<user_id=Ribbet32>** acknowledges the British alternate title but suggests changing the wording to avoid implying that it is decreed by law. This response seems to be a compromise but does not fully address the argument about the title's recognition in the UK.

6. **<user_id=Elvenscout742>** continues to argue for the inclusion of the UK title based on Wikipedia guidelines and the film's release history in the UK.

7. **<user_id=Ribbet32>** and **<user_id=JoshuSasori>** express frustration with Elvenscout742's approach but do not provide substantial counterarguments to the points raised about the title's usage.

Overall, <user_id=Elvenscout742> provides a consistent and well-sourced argument for the inclusion of the UK title ""Ugetsu Monogatari"" in the article, citing release history and Wikipedia guidelines. The counterarguments mainly focus on the appropriateness of the word ""official"" and the placement of the information within the article, rather than the substance of the title's usage in the UK. The discussion could be improved with more direct engagement with the evidence provided and less focus on the behavior of the users involved.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Also Quackwatch is frequently used as a WP:RS for alternative medicine articles - remember that it isn't the job of Wikipedia to present truth - just reliable information.

<user_id=Qazwsxedcplokmijnuhb>
I made absolutely no biomedical claims. I have cited articles in peer-reviewed journals that document therapeutic benefits. They are independent of anything Rosen. I have left your Quackwatch references in. I don't understand why you reverted my changes YET AGAIN.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

<user_id=Simonm223>
The Somatics journal also does not appear to be a WP:RS - rather it seems like a WP:FRINGE publication.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The first user, Qazwsxedcplokmijnuhb, argues that therapies discredited by Quackwatch are sometimes promoted by mainstream health organizations, using Kaiser Permanente's support of qigong and acupuncture as examples. This argument suggests that Quackwatch's credibility should be questioned because mainstream organizations have differing views.

2. The second user, Alexbrn, counters by stating that Quackwatch is considered a reliable source for fringe/alternative medicine topics on Wikipedia, and the fact that some therapies are offered by health services like the NHS does not validate their efficacy.

3. Qazwsxedcplokmijnuhb then expresses a desire to make the page encyclopedic and argues that the therapy in question is not quackery, despite the lack of mainstream sources.

4. Alexbrn emphasizes the need for reliable sources and neutrality, rejecting pro-Rosen publications that may provide biased information.

5. Qazwsxedcplokmijnuhb insists that the references they added are independent and peer-reviewed, expressing frustration over the reversion of their edits.

6. Simonm223 supports the use of Quackwatch as a reliable source for critiquing alternative practices and warns against potential neutrality issues if it is excluded. They also question the reliability of the Somatics journal, suggesting it may be a fringe publication.

The discussion quality is mixed. On one hand, there is a valid point about the need for reliable and independent sources, especially for medical claims, which is a strong argument for maintaining the integrity of the article. On the other hand, there is a lack of consensus on what constitutes a reliable source, with one user questioning the credibility of Quackwatch based on its disagreement with some mainstream practices. The conversation shows a tension between adhering to Wikipedia's standards for reliable sourcing and the desire to include a broader range of perspectives.

The users are engaging in a debate about sourcing and neutrality, which is a critical aspect of Wikipedia's content policies. However, the discussion could be improved with more direct evidence regarding the reliability of the sources in question and a more collaborative approach to resolving the dispute.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Please explain repeated removal of a referenced section. ""Communist propaganda"" is just as bad argument as if I would say that this whole article is one big ""underkilled Banderovtsi propaganda"". The question is whether there facts are true or false.

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
Actually the question is not whether these ""facts"" are true or false but whether the info is verifiable with secondary reliable sources. It's gonna take me awhile to read it but even a cursory glance suggests that these are in fact primary sources. What would be needed is secondary sources which discuss these documents and based on them state what the text being inserted claims.

<user_id=Lvivske>
This just reeks of the Jo0doe tactic of using non-English primary sources to push garbage into articles. If the Party was providing aid, I'm sure there's a historian out there that can mention it, we don't need to rely on 1st hand interpretations of primary sources.

This source introduced by Novickas is a reliable source on the food aid:

",0,"The discussion revolves around the inclusion or removal of a section in a Wikipedia article, presumably related to food aid and historical events. The participants are debating the validity and reliability of sources, as well as the appropriateness of the content based on Wikipedia's guidelines.

1. Lovok Sovok raises a concern about the repeated removal of a section that they believe is well-referenced. They argue against the dismissal of the content as ""Communist propaganda,"" suggesting that the truthfulness of the facts should be the main concern.

2. Volunteer Marek responds by emphasizing the importance of verifiability with secondary reliable sources, not just the truthfulness of the facts. They suggest that primary sources are not sufficient and that secondary sources discussing the documents are needed.

3. Lvivske echoes the sentiment about the need for secondary sources and expresses concern about the use of non-English primary sources to push biased information into articles.

4. Fifelfoo m reinforces the policy against using primary sources in historical articles, stating that only professional historians are qualified to interpret archival sources for original research, which Wikipedia is not intended for.

5. User 95.134.128.36 objects to the removal and provides references to support the inclusion of the content, including a book published by Princeton University Press and another by R. W. Davies and Stephen G. Wheatcroft.

Your proposal removes the ""Christian appraisal"" section entirely, which both User:User:LM2000 and I found useful. I do not see any issue with the section as it is (apart from your use of Patheos blogs in addition to the snopes and chick links). I mentioned that at WP:RSN and I'll be happy to go along with whatever the Wikipedia community decides there. Thanks,

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
LM2000 did not state that he found the ""Christian appraisal"" section useful, he stated that he did not mind it. I myself do not mind it, so long as it is sourced properly and contains only notable information. The endorsements from athletes, purported quotes from Christian groups which are '''not''' reflected in the cited source and the mention of the filmmaker's religious practices are all excessive and should be removed. If you insist on maintaining a separate ""Christian appraisal"" subsection, modify the above proposal to one that excludes those aspects I just mentioned and watch me jump on board with you. As far as the patheos blog citation goes, Hemant Mehta is a notable person, arguably an expert on the issue of Christian/atheist confluence, and unarguably connected to the topics covered by the film.     — Preceding undated comment added

<user_id=LM2000>
My problem with this proposed version is that it is undue in its presentation of negative reviews, which is ironically the opposite of the WP:NPOV concerns I raised last night.  The Christian Post, National Review, and The Chattanoogan are WP:RS, as far as I know, and I don't see the harm in using Pure Flix Entertainment as a primary source.  I do not have an opinion on whether parts of this should be shortened or merged, or whether the section should be renamed, but total removal of the section does seem a bit much.  Surely some of it is salvageable.

<user_id=Anupam>
I agree with User:LM2000's comment. User:MjolnirPants's version seems to present a one-sided version of the film. I agreed with User:LM2000's comments on WP:NPOV and supported his addition of ''The Washington Post'' and ''CNS'' sources to address that problem. It seems like there's consensus here to keep that section as the sources used therein are notable and reliable. As far as the Mehta source is concerned, I think that if we're going to leave it in, which I will do as a compromise to please you, we should attribute that statement to him in the article. Let me know your thoughts. Cheers,

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
I'm fine with adding more positive reviews, however I disagree that the proposal above violates WP:NPOV because reviews of the film are -in fact- overwhelmingly negative. I'm not disputing  The Christian Post, National Review, or The Chattanoogan as reliable sources. I excluded them because they seemed to be citing the description of the filmmaker's religious participation. If they support something else, please add them back in. I have encountered a small number of positive reviews not hitherto included, and I've added those to the proposal above in the interest of reachign a consensus. I've also re-created the ""Christian appraisal"" subsection. Please review and comment.

<user_id=Anupam>
Your revision is a little better, but is still unsatisfactory. It removes the quote from the President of Ratio Christi as well as all the organizations and individuals who have publicly come out to support the film. In addition, you supplant a deep quote by the Alliance Defending Freedom with a more lighthearted one. I still support the current version of the section. However, I would be open to removing the sentence that states ""Some Christian youth groups in the Methodist, Catholic, and Baptist traditions are watching God's Not Dead together"" as a compromise. Have you thought about attributing your urban myth sentence to Mehta yet? That's an issue that needs addressed. I look forward to hearing from you soon. With regards,

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
I don't feel that an endorsement (which is patently '''not''' a review) is appropriate for inclusion in the article, especially given the apparent lack of notability from which it stems. Your 'deep quote' was not supported by the source, that is why I removed it. If you want to replace the one I have kept with that one, simply add an appropriate source and I will accept that. Your offer to remove a single sentence doesn't address the core issue, which is that your section puts undue weight on '''endorsements''' from Christian groups and extraneous information, when it should properly be about '''reviews''' of the film from Christian sources, or barring that; mainstream news media discussing the film's impact in the Christian community. I don't have any problem attributing the description to Mehta, but I should point out that given the number of sources supporting my claim, that would change the description of reviewers comparing the film to the legend from a mention that ""numerous sources"" make the comparison to a longer paragraph about all the individual reviewers who made the comparison. I've made an appropriate change to the proposal for your consideration, including removing some of the references. Please review and comment.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Argument about the ""Christian appraisal"" section**: User MjolnirPants argues for the removal of non-notable information and endorsements from the ""Christian appraisal"" section, while User Anupam wants to retain the section, arguing that it is useful and the sources are reliable. MjolnirPants suggests that the section should focus on reviews from Christian sources or the film's impact on the Christian community, rather than endorsements.

2. **Concerns about WP:NPOV**: User LM2000 raises concerns about the neutrality of the proposed version, suggesting that it might be unduly negative. MjolnirPants responds by stating that the negative reviews are reflective of the overall reception of the film and is willing to add more positive reviews to balance the section.

3. **Use of sources**: There is a debate over the appropriateness of using certain sources, such as Pure Flix Entertainment as a primary source and the inclusion of a quote from Hemant Mehta. MjolnirPants argues for the inclusion of Mehta as a notable person connected to the topic, while Anupam suggests attributing statements to Mehta directly in the article.

4. **Endorsements vs. Reviews**: MjolnirPants distinguishes between endorsements and reviews, arguing that endorsements are not appropriate for inclusion in the article unless they are notably sourced. Anupam, on the other hand, believes that endorsements and supportive quotes add value to the section.

5. **Proposal of compromise**: Both users propose compromises, with MjolnirPants revising the ""Christian appraisal"" subsection and Anupam offering to remove a sentence about Christian youth groups watching the film.

6. **Quality of the discussion**: The discussion is conducted in a civil manner, with both users presenting their points and counterpoints clearly. They both show a willingness to compromise and work towards a consensus. The arguments are based on Wikipedia's guidelines and policies, such as WP:NPOV and the reliability of sources.

Overall, the quality of the arguments is high. Both users are knowledgeable about Wikipedia's policies and are actively engaging in a constructive dialogue to improve the article. They are focused on factual accuracy, relevance, and coherence in their arguments.

Number of civilians affected

<user_id=68.119.138.205>
The 613 figure is ONLY given by the government of Azerbaijan and is clearly POV along with being original research. A citation is need from a third party it should be deleted. Human Rights Watch noted a death figure of 161 or more. That is the only credible figure available.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
I believe the article makes an accurate attribution of this figure.

<user_id=Urartu TH>
While it may make an accurate attribution, the figure is only claimed in one document by the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Azerbaijan to the United Nations Office. This is clearly POV. There is no third source backing up such a figure.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
The article does not say whether this figure is accurate or not. We cannot make such assertions. The article only says that this is the death toll provided by the Azerbaijani authorities, which is true, and this is the figure that the Azerbaijani government cites. The positions of governments cannot be neutral, they are POV, and notable POVs need to be properly attributed, which has been done here. See WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV. And HRW figure of 161 is not the only estimate provided by that organization, their later reports provide a higher death toll. We cannot only mention one estimate, when there are more. We should quote all existing figures provided by third party observers and investigators.

<user_id=Urartu TH>
Adding the 1000 figure to the infobox is highly controversial and only going to lead to readers assuming that this was some sort of mass murder of ""thousands of people"" which plays in to hte hands of POV anti-Armenian hysteria of those trying to push this as a large massacre. Such claims are NOT being made on the Sumgait Pogrom, Kirovabad Pogrom, Maragha Massacre or Baku Pogrom of Armenians pages, so let's not make them here.

<user_id=Divot>
While it is widely accepted that 200 hundred Azeris were murdered, as many as 500-1,000 may have died - What does it mean? 200*100=20000 Azeris were murdered?

<user_id=Ninetoyadome>
What Grnadmaster is saying is the Human Rights Watch, which the figures are quoted from, says:
There are no exact figures for the number of Azeri civilians killed because Karabakh Armenian forces gained control of the area after the massacre. While it is widely accepted that 200 hundred Azeris were murdered, as many as 500-1,000 may have died. (http://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/a/azerbjn/azerbaij94d.pdf) bottom of page 24
That is why he the 1000 figure should stay.

<user_id=Ninetoyadome>
It just means the accepted number is 200 but the number could range from 500-1000. I dont know what you mean by multiplying 200 with 100.

<user_id=Urartu TH>
Not even the Azerbaijani government quotes such a high number as 1000; and they have an agenda here. I disagree with 1000 figure for the reasons I stated above.

<user_id=Divot>
Ninetoyadome, ""200 hundred"" means 20000, 200 = 2 hundred.

<user_id=Antelope Hunter>
Karabakh Armenian forces gained control of the area after the massacre"" How did Chingiz Mustafayev videotape the bodies, if it was under Armenian control? This 1000 claim seems highly dubious, and considering it says ""may have"", I'm in favor not including the said figure.

<user_id=Ninetoyadome>
Divot, i see what you mean, there was a typo on the document, its just 200. Urartu, that is a good point that the Azeri govt doesnt even go up to 1000. It's up to you guys and Grandmaster whether that figure should stay or not.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
We do not pick what to include from the source, and what not. If the source says ""as many as 500-1,000 may have died"", then this is what we write. Anyone's personal opinion on whether this might be true or not is irrelevant here, as it is WP:OR, and we only go with what the source says. See WP:STICKTOSOURCE. So the number of 1000 as the highest estimate remains, obviously with proper attribution.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
That is why he the 1000 figure should stay.

<user_id=Urartu TH>
On page 24 of the reports, HRW states ""More than 200 civilians were killed in the attack, the largest massacre to date in the conflict"". Per this statement, the 200 figure is a definite term. The 500-1000 figure is given in a footnote on page 24 which states, ""There are no exact figures for the number of Azeri civilians killed because Karabakh Armenian forces gained control of the area after the massacre. While it is widely accepted that 200 hundred Azeris were murdered, as many as 500-1,000 may have died"". Once again we see that 200 is the accepted figure, while someone is merely speculating that more could have died. Adding the 500-1000 figure to the infobox equates it to the ""widely accepted"" figure of 200; this will surely be confusing to readers. As I mentioned above, such wild/offhand figures are not added to the Sumgait Pogrom, Kirovabad Pogrom, Maragha Massacre or Baku Pogrom of Armenians pages, so let's not add them here.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
HRW does not say that any figure is definite. It says that there are no exact figures, so I don't see how you can claim that any figure is definite. More than 200 could be 500 or 1000, so I don't see how this figure makes impossible higher numbers. HRW provides a range of possible number of casualties, which is between 200-1000. We cannot engage in original research and pick what we like in a source, and what we don't. If HRW says that ""as many as 500-1,000 may have died"", this is what we write in the article. Remember, we must stick to sources, according to the rules. When you put into infobox the number of 200, it creates a false illusion that this is the number that HRW supports, while HRW makes it perfectly clear that the higher death toll is possible. As a compromise, I propose to amend the part in question as ""161+, or 200 - possibly up to 500 - 1,000"", making it close to HRW statement.

<user_id=Urartu TH>
I disagree. Not even Azerbaijan uses a figure more than 613 and their figure is certainly POV. If we used every wild figure that may be speculated in a footnote then we'd have an obscure/confusing infobox for all of the massacres of the Karabakh conflict. I propose we amend the infobox to state: ""more than 200"" or ""200+"".

<user_id=Grandmaster>
We cannot do that, it is against the rules. We should stick to the source, and write what the source says. No original research, and your personal beliefs as to whether any number could be true or not cannot be a basis for selectively quoting a source.

<user_id=Urartu TH>
I'm not sure why you continue to ignore the trhust of my point, which is that the 500-100 figure is merely in ONE footnote by one official who was not on the ground. The statement is not made using any empirical evidence and statistical data. Not even the Azerbaijani government quotes a figure of 1000 and they were certainly biased. If you want, include the 500-1000 figure in the body and note that it is only mentioned in a FOOTNOTE in one document by someone who is not verified as having been on the ground; otherwise you are misleading readers by equating that figure with the widely accepted one of ""more than 200.""

<user_id=Grandmaster>
It does not matter whether it is a footnote or not, it is in the document, and that is the only thing that matters. This number is already in the text of the article, and there's no reason why it should not be in the infobox. I have already explained you the rules many times, and you still haven't provided any valid reason why we should violate the rules and omit information contained in the reliable source. All you said was your personal opinion on why you believe that the number is no good, but personal opinions have no relevance here. We only refer to sources, and we do not interpret or alter them.

<user_id=Urartu TH>
I'm glad you've noticed that the figure from the footnote, 500-1000, is mentioned in the article. A mention in the body is different from the infobox. Placing it into the infobox gives it the validity and weight that it does NOT have. This is the point you keep ignoring. This is the reason it hasn't been in the infobox for years; you are the one pushing this POV and controversial change to the infobox. We should certainly mention that the 500-1000 figure is noted as an unsubstantiated guess/possibility in the footnote of ONE single document by one person, but including it in the infobox is ridiculous. Context is key here; what you are proposing is confusing to readers. We should not change the status quo.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
I don't see how mention in the body is different from mention in the infobox. If it is in the text, it should be in the infobox as well. Show me the rule that does not allow inclusion of the info from the text of the article into infobox. The rest is your original research. Again, the source mentions this number, and as it is a sourced info, it should be included. I don't want to waste the community's time by taking this to the appropriate forum, but I will if you keep on insisting on your original research.

<user_id=Urartu TH>
You are the one quoting ""rules"" and not showing us which rules actually support your controversial and POV changes to an infobox that hasn't had that 500-1000 footnote figure ever (including years). You've conveniently not responded to any of the community' concerns on this talk page, including mine just above; your viewpoint is clearly in the minority here amongst , , and myself.

Thomas de Waal. Существуют разные оценки числа убитых азербайджанцев в Ходжалы или в его окрестностях. Пожалуй, наиболее правдоподобная цифра - та, которая была получена в ходе официального расследования, предпринятого азербайджанским парламентом. По этим данным, число погибших составило 485 человек.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
I responded to everything. But I do not engage in a discussion about the validity of HRW estimates, because it not our task to do so, and it is a violation of WP:OR. Otherwise, I explained to you that we only write what the reliable sources say, and if they say that the death toll could have been as high as 500 - 1000, then we just write that. It is not up to us to decide whether this number is reliable or not. And your argument is a good example of Wikipedia:I just don't like it. And finally, the disputes here are not resolved by majority of opinions.

<user_id=Grandmaster>
Ok, but what is the point of this quote? I never said that any number is more reliable than the other. All I said was that reliable estimates should be included in the infobox, and this one could be included as well.

",1,"The discussion revolves around the inclusion of a specific figure related to the number of civilian casualties in an infobox on a Wikipedia page. The main points of contention are the reliability of the source, the interpretation of the figures provided by the source, and the appropriate representation of these figures in the infobox.

Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Urartu TH argues that the higher figure of 500-1000 casualties is speculative and not substantiated by empirical evidence, and therefore should not be given equal weight in the infobox as the more widely accepted figure of ""more than 200.""

2. User Grandmaster counters by emphasizing the need to adhere to the source (Human Rights Watch report) and include all figures mentioned, arguing that personal opinions on the validity of the figures should not influence the content.

3. User Divot points out a typo in the document, which is acknowledged and corrected by User Ninetoyadome, clarifying that the widely accepted number is 200, but the range could be up to 500-1000.

4. User Grandmaster suggests a compromise to include a range of figures in the infobox, reflecting the HRW statement more closely.

5. User Urartu TH maintains that including the higher range in the infobox would mislead readers, as it is not substantiated and not even used by the Azerbaijani government, which would have a bias towards higher figures.

6. User Grandmaster insists on sticking to the source and including the information as it is presented in the HRW report, regardless of its placement in a footnote.

7. User Divot introduces a quote from Thomas de Waal, which provides another figure for the number of casualties, but the relevance of this quote to the argument is not fully explored in the discussion.

The quality of the arguments presented varies. User Grandmaster consistently argues for adherence to the source material and against the introduction of original research, which is a strong position in line with Wikipedia's guidelines. User Urartu TH raises valid concerns about the potential for misleading readers and the importance of context, which are also important considerations for Wikipedia content. The discussion shows an engagement with the source material and an attempt to balance different viewpoints and concerns about representation and accuracy.

However, the discussion could benefit from a more thorough examination of the reliability of the different figures and a clearer consensus on how to represent ranges of figures in infoboxes, which seems to be a point of confusion. Additionally, the discussion could be improved by exploring the relevance of the new figure introduced by User Divot and how it fits into the overall context of the debate.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.0",7.0

It's dead at the box office, and will struggle to reach 18mil domestic, on a Mid-30's budget (and yes, I have a source for that).  Overseas has been equally dismal so far.  Box Office Mojo called it a bomb, as did Deadline Hollywood.  The trades used slightly more polite language to say the same thing.  We can debate the language, but the meaning remains the samethis movie was a box office failure.  And how it was received at its red carpet opening in Florida, according to a puff piece in a local paper is really quite beside the point.  That entire section should be deleted.  It's not useful informationof course people said nice things about a movie that was shot in their area.  To devote so much space to such a minor event relating to a flop movie seems odd.

<user_id=Arre 9>
You are very ignorant in thinking a film that under-grossed is irrelevant and does not deserve available coverage on Wikipedia. The section is about ""release""; premieres and stuff like that is apart of its release. This section is not only about its commercial performance. Also, roughly 90% of sources have reported the film's budget to be 30 million; so don't alter that.

I was not remotely saying the film shouldn't be 'covered' on Wikipedia (where did you get that idea?), simply that the purpose of the article isn't to try and put lipstick on a pig.  The West Palm Beach opening was a nice gesture to the community, and means absolutely nothing, because people were reacting to the fact that they were getting some kind of gala event in their community (this isn't the rich part of Palm Beach, you understandthose people wouldn't have come at all).  I'm fine with having the event mentioned, and I'll leave in the part about the proceeds going to charity, but using this to try and make it seem like the film was well received, when it clearly was not, simply won't fly.  I don't know what you mean about '90% of sources', btw.  Can I see the other nine, please?  Obviously not all sources are created equal here, and when somebody who was involved in financing, producing, and releasing a movie says in Hollywood's paper of record that the budget was in the Mid-30 million dollar range, right around the time the picture comes out, that means it cost at least that much.  The Numbers was just estimating well in advance of release, and probably any other sources were just using their estimate.  It's outdated information, and I will change it as many times as I have to.  It's a flop movie either way, and this article will reflect that.

<user_id=Status>
I think it's ''too soon'' to classify the film as being anything. It's still yet to be released in the UK, Australia, France, etc.  —  ,

<user_id=Xfpisher>
Which is why I'm not dealing with the foreign box office yet.  But it's been pretty dismal so far, and there's little reason to think the few remaining major markets will change that.  EVERY box office observer of  note has called this movie a flop.  Having done this badly in North America (and really, every foreign market other than Russia, where it did respectable but unremarkable box office and is now quite finished), there's no way it can be perceived as anything other than a flop when all the money is counted.  That's why Box Office Mojo called it a bomb on the first weekendthere was no coming back from that opening, which is why calling it 'modest' is kind of understating the problem.

<user_id=Xfpisher>
Btw, have you actually SEEN this movie?  I note in passing that you are Australian, and it hasn't opened there yet.  I also note that your primary concern seems to be that Jennifer Lopez is in it.  Well, I'm not concerned with that at all.  Put her up for an Oscar, if you want to.  But a flop remains a flop.  Why don't you go edit the page for Gigli?  )

<user_id=Erik>
I concur that ""modest"" is an inappropriate term to use. The citation says, ""Parker and Movie 43 had terrible debuts,"" and we should state that. To say ""perform modestly"" is misleading. I would also excise the Statham ranking; it is too low to be consequential to the article.   |

<user_id=Xfpisher>
Erik, why don't you edit it?  I'd willingly cede the exact phrasing to you, and if you think the ranking should go, then by all means delete it.  I just wanted to make it clear how badly this movie didI mean, it's been in theaters a little over a month here, and it grossed about 15k yesterday in all of North America.  That's pretty damn bad.  It's hardly the biggest flop of all time, but it is one of the worst flops Statham has been in.  Not Lopez, to be sure, but I don't really think that's her fault.  It's not really the article's job to explain whose fault it is, but again, a flop is a flop is a flop.  And this is a flop.

<user_id=Arre 9>
You're obviously very vocal in your need to address this as a flop and pig. Ofcourse I've seen this film, I wrote the plot section. As stated by Status, it is too early to deem this a flop overall. No offense, but your edits aren't exactly going well with the flow of the article. That is why I'm trying to wait until the film has come out in all regions to finish off the release section. Then It can be addressed as a flop. I do work on Lopez articles, but her being in the film isn't why I haven't summed it up as a flop yet. Please don't be rude and have some patience!

<user_id=Arre 9>
Additionally, the film got mixed to negative reviews from film critics; however you say it was badly received.... if a movie was awful like Gigli, people would not clap even if it was filmed in their town. Stop reading in between the lines; the fact that the crowd were impressed with the movie means they had a positive reaction with it, although critics did not.

<user_id=Xfpisher>
Arre, we have enough information now.  You are disagreeing with two editors.  The movie is a bomb. If by some miracle it does huge box office in the few remaining major markets (and there's absolutely no reason to think it will), we can always edit again, but it's a bomb in North America as of right now, and will remain oneErik's phrasing is perfectit was and is viewed as a bomb heresince it's an American film, you can hardly say that doesn't matter.  I'm not saying foreign markets don't count, I don't think that at all, but it's already opened in most of those markets, and it did very poorly in all but one of them.  It's a bomb everywhere but Russia, and it was a very moderate performer there.

Arre, when you call another editor 'ignorant' (when you can't prove a single thing he's said wrong), you really don't have any business talking about rudeness.  It's really not too early, and the current language (which is not mine) should stand.  In any event, this is an American movie, and a performance this bad in the domestic market makes it a bomb, even if it's a huge hit elsewhere, which thus far it hasn't been.  There's no reason to wait until it's opened in every last territory (last one is in April) to say what's obvious.  It's a bomb.  It's also a picture with a Mid-30's budget, and I'll change that as many times as I have to.  You did not, I notice, list any other of the '90%' of sources you mention.  The Numbers estimate was fine, but now we have something better, and that's what's going to be used.

<user_id=Xfpisher>
I'll leave the part about the reviews being mixed to negative as it standsthat's fine. But the stuff about the West Palm Beach opening is just too long, and the source is not terribly impressive.  It reeks of puffery.  I'll have to keep deleting that.  Accept the compromise.

<user_id=Xfpisher>
Xfpisher, I only referred to your thinking as ignorant. You kinda imply that because the film undeperforms at the US box office, it isn't notable. Telling me to go work on Gigli because all care about is Lopez (untrue) is a little blunt/rude. Also, maybe i used the wrong words. You are in a rush to classify this as a flop. Just wait till we have enough results. Regarding the West Palm Beach line, the source is perfectly fine and i condensed the sentence. All is says is ''the crowd reacted with positive feedback to the film''..is this too sentence too difficult to endure? Also, I have no time to give you a list of 90% of sources, you know very well I meant that as a rough point. Please accept the fact that 30m is the most widely reported figure. ""mid 30s"" could be anything in the 30s, basically. Just because there is something better, doesn't mean that has to override hundreds of other sources. I'm kindly asking you to consider what I've said. Also, have you failed to see the adjustments I've made? You have your bomb clarification and I have provided multiple sources for the 30m figure (could give you many many more, but I couldn't be bothered). Additionally, please note that films don't always mirror movies, they are just based around them. The valid source said Daniel Parmett. Also, I spoke nothing about altering the reviews (just telling you that reviews and the crowds reaction are two separate deals), so there is no compromise being made here, just your adamant thoughts about the budget being 35m.....

<user_id=Arre 9>
For gods sake Xfpisher, have I once stated this film wasn't a bomb or flop? We know you love to use these words, but no need to keep ''repeating yourself''. It's already been clarified that it underperformed in the US. Once it's been out in all markets then we can have a general statement. Actually, you're the one disagreeing with two editors. You lack sources to prove your 35m figure, while we've got plenty for the 30m figure. I don't see why you are insistent on ""~35 million"". Final response.

<user_id=Xfpisher>
Again, I'm not the one who edited the box office information last, so take it up with Erik.  And again, Nick Meyer, a studio executive, is a better source than a very early estimate from a website which wouldn't have had insider information, and which was undoubtedly the source for all the other sources you cited.  Not blaming The Numbers, but they are known for always putting up an estimate, even if there's no reliable info to be had.  They came pretty close, but were still millions off.  Again, if the consensus is leave it blank until such time as there's an exact figure, fine.  But just know I'll be sending that article link to The Numbers and Box Office Mojo.  They LIKE getting valid information. )

<user_id=Arre 9>
Why do you keep going on about 'The Numbers'? they were just one of many sources which contained the 30m figure. I didn't even look into that source much. What you do in your own time (spitefully send links to organizations to prove your point on a Wikipedia article) is not relevant here - so please keep that to yourself.

<user_id=Xfpisher>
The other sources you've put up are not real sources.  They are minor online articles that are quite certainly using The Numbers as a source.  And Arre, weren't you saying I was being too personal a short time back?  I could easily respond in kind, but it's not worth the aggro, to use your local slang.  )

<user_id=Arre 9>
they are. I could have put up many more, I just put up the first ones i could find. ''The Observer'', ''Las Vegas Sun'', E! Online, etc are perfect sources. It's so obvious here: you know I edited most of this article. You are determined to point out every little mistake. I mean look at your edit summaries. A lot of your adjustments are positive but no need to brag on about it. I made one simple typo and you go and on about it in the edit summary. Learn how to edit and contribute to discussions without viewing this as a game, in which you would always like you 'win'. Your attitude is blatantly obvious.

<user_id=Xfpisher>
Again, with the type of 'source' you're using, it's just an endless replication of junk information.  The Numbers SAYS they're just estimating, but when there's nothing else available, people working with a deadline use what they can find with a Google search.  Nick Meyer was directly involved with financing the movie, and has no reason to inflate the budget (rather the opposite, which means it could be more than he says).  But again, what's the problem here?  I'm not trying to edit it back to 35milleave it blank for now.  What's the harm?  Why do you need it to say 30mil, when it obviously was more than that?  I'm not the one hanging on here.  Of course you've made contributions, who said otherwise?  If by typo, you mean 'shocked' instead of 'shot' (which is what the linked source said, as I think you know by now) then why did you edit it back again the first time?  That's the only reason I went on about it, because it was irritating having to fix an obvious mistake TWICE.  At least you're accepting it's 'Parmitt', not 'Parmett'.  We're making progress here.  If you can accept the language about the crowd reaction in Palm Beach being deleted, and leave my latest edits alone, I'd be quite happy to let this go for now.  I'd think you would be too.  Peace, out.

<user_id=Arre 9>
The reason I edited it back is because all of your other edits were unnecessary. Please learn to work around things. Would you please stop saying the Numbers? It's very annoying...you're just going on and on about something that's already been clarified. No one cares. Goodbye ) the only progress we've made here is you not adding back your ""assumptions"" into the article (This is Wikpiedia, so obviously we are going to use to most widely reported figure [The sources didn't get this number from ''The Numbers'', ''The Numbers'' obviously got this figure from other sources] instead of something a user assumes just because it came from one source.

<user_id=Status>
But just know I'll be sending that article link to The Numbers and Box Office Mojo and magically, Box Office Mojo has 35 million now listed as its budget, although there's no source that actually states that, just ""mid-30s"".  —  ,

<user_id=Arre 9>
Fishy.

<user_id=Xfpisher>
Translationbecause I sent them information they judged to be good enough to put up a budget numberwhich they hadn't done before, since bomojo is always a lot more careful about that kind of thing than The Numbersyou don't want to use it as a source, even though obviously I can't EDIT the Parker entry on that website.  I emailed them.  They checked it out.  They put it up.  Faster than I thought they would (I emailed them day before yesterday), so maybe it wasn't even because of me.  Even if it was because I sent them the information, they still had to check it out, and obviously they considered that quote from Variety sufficient.  And your response to that is 'fishy'.  And yes it isbut the fishy smell is coming from you, Arre. Your quarrel isn't with me, but with the facts.

<user_id=Arre 9>
No need to explain Xfpisher, it's obvious what's happened here, and it certainly is peculiar.

<user_id=Xfpisher>
What's 'peculiar' about my finding an interview that gives us the best available information, and making that available to online sources, two of which have found it credible, and used it to determine an approximate budget for this movie?  Which again, is the best anybody can dono exact figure will ever be available, and this figure is obviously much closer to the mark than the previous one, which you wanted to keep up.  I truly believe you'd have accepted Box Office Mojo as a source if I hadn't honestly admitted that I'd given them the information that led to their putting up the numberI certainly could have handled some things better, but that could be said of you as well, so maybe we should forgive each other our trespasses and move on.  But that's neither here nor there with regards to the factsthere is no perfect source for movie budgets, so you go with the best sources you can find, and you certainly pay attention when people who devote themselves to documenting this kind of thing find a source credible enough to use.  Clear your head, count to 10, do the right thing.  (editing this in) I just got an email from Bruce Nash, who runs The Numbershe thanked me for sending him the source, and he's already updated his databasehe says the updated budget number (with article citation) will appear on the website in the near future.  So that's Box Office Mojo, The Internet Movie Database, AND The Numbers saying 35mil.  And I'm still not editing it.  Honestly, I'm not sure what difference it makes at this point.  Just thought you'd want to know.

<user_id=Arre 9>
Again with the essays. Calm down, the budget which has magically appeared on these sites after ''you'' emailed them with a 'mid-30s' source will go up.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. The main point of contention is the classification of the film ""Parker"" as a flop and the accuracy of its reported budget.
2. User Xfpisher argues that the film is a bomb based on its performance at the box office and cites sources like Box Office Mojo and Deadline Hollywood to support this claim.
3. User Arre 9 argues that it is too soon to classify the film as a flop and that the budget reported by most sources is $30 million, not the ""mid-30s"" claimed by Xfpisher.
4. User Xfpisher provides evidence from a studio executive stating the budget is in the mid-30s and is adamant about changing the budget figure on Wikipedia.
5. User Status points out that it might be too soon to classify the film's performance, suggesting waiting until it has been released in all markets.
6. User Xfpisher claims to have contacted Box Office Mojo and The Numbers with the new budget information, which they have updated on their sites.
7. User Arre 9 finds it peculiar that these sites updated their information so quickly after Xfpisher's contact and is skeptical of the source's reliability.

Evaluation of argument quality:

- User Xfpisher provides specific sources and engages in external actions (contacting Box Office Mojo and The Numbers) to support their claims, showing a high level of commitment to factual accuracy.
- User Arre 9 emphasizes the importance of waiting for a global box office assessment and the use of widely reported figures, which is a reasonable approach to ensure the neutrality and stability of the Wikipedia article.
- The discussion involves some personal attacks and accusations of bias, which detracts from the overall quality of the argumentation.
- Both users show some understanding of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, but the discussion could benefit from a more collaborative approach and less confrontational language.

Considering the evidence provided, the commitment to factual accuracy, and the relevance of the arguments, despite the confrontational tone, the discussion shows a moderate level of quality in terms of content. However, the personal attacks and lack of collaboration lower the overall quality.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Attempts at removing well sourced material

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
I'm sorry but in regard to this  where in the world do you get the idea that this is based on a ""bad source"" (whatever that is). It's a reliable source. The material is faithful to the source. A place called ''Stralow'' or ''Strzałów'' did exist at the time and even if somehow it didn't, then you can always take the map to refer to a locale. Again, it's based on a reliable source.
Please stop removing well sourced content for POV and WP:IDON'TLIKEIT reasons.

<user_id=Skäpperöd>
Exceptional claims need exceptional sources. The material/reference introduced by you claims that Stralsund existed in 1121. That is a novel claim contradicting everything published so far. If you can substantiate that with high-quality sources, which I doubt, then the material can be re-introduced.

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
And stop it with the edit warring - you're up to 3 reverts in less than 30 minutes without a halfway decent reason.

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
There's nothing exceptional here. A place called ""Stralow"" or ""Strzałów"" existed. And like I said, the map indicates locale.

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
Look. It's a reliable source. It's a faithful reproduction of material in a reliable source - it's pretty hard to fake a map. You got nothing to stand on here. Stop making stuff up and drop the POV and IDONTLIKEIT.

<user_id=Skäpperöd>
Though it was your inability to follow BRD that provoked an edit war here, I self reverted and tagged it as disputed linking to this discussion just to let this not reflect badly on me. You have got 24 hours time to back up the claim that Stralsund existed in 1121 by good sources, else I proceed withn following BRD and remove it for good.

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
Sorry, that's not how it works, and you really shouldn't lecture me about BRD when you just reverted 3 times in 30 minutes. I don't know why you think that you can make these kinds of ultimatums either. I don't have to back up the claim that Stralsund existed in 1121 (which is actually an irrelevant red herring you're bringing into this). All I have to do is provide a reliable source that the map is based on. I already have done that. If *you* have a problem with the source then take it to reliable sources noticeboard.

<user_id=Skäpperöd>
Just provide the sources. No historian has ever claimed before that Stralsund existed in 1121. If you want to introduce such a novel claim which, if it could be substantiated, would mean that the history of Stralsund has to be rewritten, then you need good sources to back that up. If you can't, this information needs to go. Verifiability alone is not sufficient for such a claim - Wikipedia:Exceptional_claims_require_exceptional_sources#Exceptional_claims_require_exceptional_sources. 24 hours of time should be sufficient if the claim you make could be substantiated by dedicated sources.

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
I've uploaded a version of the map without the word ""Stralsund"" in there, which should address this little pretext.

<user_id=Skäpperöd>
That does of course not solve anything, because you left Stralsund in the map and in the text, you just deleted a name and call it only Stralow now. Where are your sources for the exceptional claim that place existed in 1121?

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
The source is reliable. The map is based on the source. You are just invoking some personal WP:IDONTLIKEIT. There is no substance to your pretext. Stop removing sourced info. Take it to WP:RSN if you want to.

<user_id=Skäpperöd>
Wikipedia:Exceptional_claims_require_exceptional_sources is policy. Provide such sources and we don't need to argue.

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
There are no exceptional claims being made here. You pulled that out of thin air. Please stop being obstinate.
Anyway, since you seem more interested in starting edit wars than resolving the disagreement, I've brought this up at WP:RSN myself: .

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. The core of the dispute is whether the claim that ""Stralsund existed in 1121"" is supported by reliable sources and whether the claim is exceptional, requiring exceptional sources.

2. User Volunteer Marek argues that the source is reliable and that the material is faithful to the source. They also mention that the map is hard to fake, implying the authenticity of the information.

3. User Skäpperöd counters by stating that the claim is novel and contradicts existing historical understanding. They invoke the Wikipedia policy that exceptional claims require exceptional sources, suggesting that the burden of proof is on Volunteer Marek to provide such sources.

4. Volunteer Marek asserts that there is nothing exceptional about the claim and that the existence of a place called ""Stralow"" or ""Strzałów"" is indicated by the map.

5. Skäpperöd maintains their position, asking for dedicated sources to substantiate the claim, emphasizing the need for historical accuracy and adherence to Wikipedia policies.

6. Volunteer Marek attempts to compromise by uploading a version of the map without the word ""Stralsund,"" but Skäpperöd points out that this does not address the underlying issue of the claim's veracity.

7. Both parties suggest taking the matter to the reliable sources noticeboard (RSN) for further discussion, which is a constructive approach to resolving the dispute.

The average quality of arguments in this discussion is moderate. Both parties present their points based on Wikipedia policies and guidelines. Volunteer Marek focuses on the reliability of the source and the authenticity of the map, while Skäpperöd emphasizes the need for exceptional sources for exceptional claims and historical accuracy. The discussion could be improved by providing more detailed information about the sources in question and by both parties working collaboratively to verify the claim. The use of Wikipedia's dispute resolution mechanisms, such as the RSN, is a positive aspect of the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

The Way of Love

<user_id=SWLinPHX>
I have amended the explanation of that song to indicate that the way it is often interpreted is not necessarily correct.  One may argue that an analysis of any one of her specific recordings or hit singles does not belong in a general biography about the pop superstar, but if that partial explanation is to remain, then my correction must too.  I ask Hullaballoo_Wolfowitz not to keep immediately reverting it without explanation.
The 1972 single ""The Way of Love"" ''has been presumed to be'' either about a woman expressing her love for another woman, or a woman breaking up with a gay male she loved (""What will you do/When he sets you free/Just the way that you/Said good-bye to me"").  ''However, many contend that as the singer of the song she is imparting advice on matters of the heart to another woman in the second person, but then directs the line ""Just the way that you said goodbye to me"" at the man who recently left her, on which her advice is based.''

<user_id=Lordelliott>
Hi folks. First of all, the interpretation of the song is referenced. Secondly, the analysis is an example of the following sentence: ""Her ability to carry both male and female ranges allowed her to sing solo in androgynous and gender-neutral-themed songs."" SWLinPHX, sorry but you can't add ANYTHING without a reference. Sorry for my english.

<user_id=SWLinPHX>
It is you Hullaballoo who have reverted the same text three times in an hour.  Either my addition should be included or the entire interpretation of the song should be deleted.  You continue to insist only one side (the common misconception) be represented. You are also disingenuous in your assertion that I engaged in cite breaking, as there were no cites to the original (and incomplete) analysis of the lyrics to begin with; I merely expanded and clarified.  Anyone can see that in the revision history.  Never did I insert my own text before a citation of a source.  Being a ""Wiki-bully"" or acting as if you own the rights to a page by deleting all edits that you don't personally approve is against TOS.  And you did not give clear or specific reasoning (although incorrect) until just now, after your third reversion of my edit.  There is a difference between an experienced, courteous editor and a bully who is marking what they consider their territory.

<user_id=Fat&Happy>
Since the citation is to a review of the carrier album by one reviewer, it might be better to either supply a source supporting the idea that this is a consensus view of the song's meaning or attribute the interpretation to that reviewer. Lots of comments by reviewers in articles about singers and musicians (and books, actors, movies, etc.) seem to be specifically attributed.

<user_id=Lordelliott>
You are right, I'll make the attribution. Thanks,

<user_id=Hullaballoo Wolfowitz>
Don't add your own unreferenced lyric analysis to articles; don't falsely claim other editors haven't explained their edits; don't insert your own comments between article text and the relevant citations, deceptively creating the impression that your original analyses are supported by the citations. Instead, read and comply with [[WP:RS], WP:BLP, and WP:SYNTHESIS. Posting palpably false claims on other editors' talk pages is also unacceptable. If you persist in such behavior, you will place your editing privileges in jeopardy.

<user_id=SWLinPHX>
I think you should all consider these few items of note before including that passage on Cher's Wikipedia page:
'1) The song was not written nor first recorded by Cher.  It was written first with French lyrics in 1960.  It was first recorded in English by Kathy Kirby of the UK in 1965.  She employed the same pronoun use that is the basis of the debate over the interpretation.  So it has nothing to do with Cher being androgynous or ""gender neutral"".  Cher simply did not change the lyrics.  So should she be credited for them?''
'2) It is very unlikely that a 1965 easy listening/adult contemporary song such as this was supposed to make any statement or reference to lesbianism or homosexuality in any way.  You are interpreting this with a 21st Century mentality.''
'3) Vicki Carr included the song on an album which was produced by Snuff Garrett, the same man who produced this song for Cher.  He approved of the lyric being altered from the original Kathy Kirby (and later Cher) version to ""What will you do when he sets you free?  Just the way that he said goodbye to me"".  So after he produced Cher's recording he realized the confusion or ""mistake"" in the song and corrected it.''
'4) Contrary to initial reaction, it was later understood that the original version was likely a woman who is suffering from her own recent jilting, and thus is giving this advice to another girl or woman.  She then, lamenting her own situation, turns to direct that last line to the man who left her (""Just the way that you said goodbye to me""), as he was on her mind the whole time she was giving the advice, which itself is based on this recent loss.''
'5) Because Joe Viglione of Allmusic may have inferred the homosexual reference does not supersede all the evidence here.  Many, MANY songs are often misunderstood or misinterpreted at first by the listening public.''
'6) The analysis of this (or any) one specific song does not really belong on a page that is about Cher in general.  It is too off-topic, even if she was the original recording artist or it had been written for her (and all the gender theories were emphatically true), but it was not.  This discussion belongs on the Wikipedia page for the song itself, which already exists.''
'7) Finally, other than this dubious, weak and misguided reference, what other examples are there that Cher herself sang gender-neutral songs?   Can you cite any?  Having a deeper, contralto range does not in and of itself lend her songs to being construed as ""androgynous"".''
Anyone who is a Cher fan or Wikipedia aficionado should want only the most accurate and pertinent information to be included in its articles.  In light of all the above, I kindly urge you to reconsider.

<user_id=Lordelliott>
I agree with items 1, 2 (although any of us, Wikipedia users, is interpreting the song), 3, 4 and 5, so I will remove the analysis. As for the items 6 and 7, the analysis of a specific song belongs to the artist's main article if it serves as an example to a fact, as seen in good and featured articles like Madonna (entertainer), Michael Jackson or David Bowie. I can name examples of what you asked, but it would not be valuable since Wikipedia only accepts referenced content. We can't discuss the androgyny in Cher vocals; if a reliable source like Allmusic published that, it belongs to the Music section of Cher's article, even with attribution. Thanks for your observations. I am currently learning to speak English fluently, so sorry for any mistakes.

<user_id=Lordelliott>
Before removing Viglione's citation, I have a point: we know Cher wasn't the first to record the song, but her version was by far the most popular. Certainly the song brought discussion about its dubious lyrics, even if that was not the intention. If the discussion existed (and many sources prove that), I believe it should stay in the article.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **<user_id=SWLinPHX>** presents a detailed argument challenging the interpretation of the song ""The Way of Love"" as it relates to Cher's biography. The user provides historical context, suggesting that the song's interpretation as having a homosexual theme may be anachronistic and not intended by the original artists. The user also argues that the song's analysis may not be relevant to Cher's general biography and that it should be confined to the song's specific page. The argument is well-structured and raises valid points about historical context and relevance.

2. **<user_id=Lordelliott>** responds by acknowledging the need for references and the importance of attributing interpretations to specific reviewers. This user shows an understanding of Wikipedia's guidelines and the importance of sourcing. However, the user also argues that the analysis of a specific song can belong to the artist's main article if it serves as an example of a broader fact, which is a reasonable point.

3. **<user_id=Fat&Happy>** suggests that the interpretation should be attributed to the reviewer if it is not a consensus view. This is a constructive contribution that aligns with Wikipedia's guidelines for verifiability and neutral point of view.

4. **<user_id=Hullaballoo Wolfowitz>** warns against adding unreferenced material and emphasizes adherence to Wikipedia's policies. While the tone may be perceived as confrontational, the emphasis on policy compliance is important for maintaining the integrity of Wikipedia's content.

5. **<user_id=Lordelliott>** again responds by agreeing with several points made by SWLinPHX and decides to remove the analysis based on the discussion. This shows a willingness to consider other viewpoints and to make changes based on the arguments presented.

Overall, the discussion demonstrates a good understanding of Wikipedia's policies, the importance of sourcing, and the relevance of content. The participants engage in a substantive debate about the interpretation of a song and its place in an artist's biography. The arguments are generally coherent, and there is a clear effort to reach a consensus that aligns with Wikipedia's standards.

Release Dates

<user_id=Benifb>
Someone has now put up 1up as their ""source"" for the April 15 release date. It should be noted that 1up originally said it would be March 15, then changed it to ""Spring 2008"" and now April 15, all without any announcements from Nintendo. I have no idea where they got this date from, but I think the release date should be kept to ""Spring 2008"" or ""Q2 2008"" until an OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT has been made. It's ridiculous that every time I open this page, there's a new NA release date; I even saw March 31 yesterday, which I had to correct since it didn't even make any sense, March 31 being before the already announced Japanese and European releases.

<user_id=Locke Cole>
1UP.com is Electronic Gaming Monthly which is a reliable source. Official announcements would actually not be usable on Wikipedia because they would be considered a primary source. Please see WP:V. — •  •

<user_id=Benifb>
1up.com has been listing this date for a while now, even as Nintendo of America continues to say there has been no official announcement on the release date. What makes this April 15 date any more reliable than the March 15 date that 1up had previously listed as the release date? They changed it as soon as the Japanese and European releases were announced, when it became obvious that it wouldn't be coming out in NA in March.

<user_id=DVD Smith>
It's nothing more than a logical guess. They probably assumed April 15th because it follows the same release pattern as Double Dash - released in Europe on the Friday, then in North America the following Tuesday.

<user_id=Locke Cole>
This is all fascinating original research, but second guessing our sources isn't what we do on Wikipedia. We have a source saying April 15th, 2008, and that's what we should be reporting. Not individual editors ""gut feelings"". — •  •

<user_id=Zomic13>
We should not have a date at all until we get an official announcement. The ""sources"" don't have a clue when the game is coming out any more than we do. Just look at them - we have a source that says April 15, April 28, May 1, June 1, and Q2 2008 All of those are reliable, trustworthy video game websites and they each list a different date. -

<user_id=Locke Cole>
Please see WP:RS, we use reliable sources. The only reliable source you quoted was 1up, which is Ziff-Davis/Electronic Gaming Monthly (an actual printed publication). Those other sources are indeed likely guessing. — •  •

<user_id=Zomic13>
No, that is not true at all. IGN and Gamespot are just as reliable as 1up.com. -

<user_id=Locke Cole>
As reliable sources go, 1up is more reliable/credible than the others as it is the online incarnation of an actual physical publication. Again, see WP:V and WP:RS. — •  •

<user_id=Zomic13>
First, a reliable source is a reliable source. Just because it also has a print publication doesn't make it any more reliable than a purely online site. If anything IGN is the most reliable site because of its dedicated Nintendo team that has close ties to Nintendo... Regardless though, the point is that none of the sites know for sure because the Nintendo has not officially revealed the date. Until Nintendo does, every site is just guess and we shouldn't list guesses, sourced or not. -

<user_id=Locke Cole>
Not true, we shouldn't list guesses made by editors, that would be original research on our part. Wikipedia routinely cites reliable sources best guesses though, and I see no reason why this situation should be any different. An ""official announcement"" is actually not something we would use on Wikipedia as it is considered a primary source unless the announcement was being reported by a secondary source (1UP, EGM, etc). — •  •

<user_id=Zomic13>
By picking one reliable source over another we are essentially listing a guess made by you. I would agree with you if all of the reliable sources were listing the same date, but they are not. Thus the best course of action is to list the date as TBA. -

<user_id=Locke Cole>
But saying ""TBA"" is itself original research because we have a date with a reliable source. Do you see the issue? — •  •

<user_id=Zomic13>
We have many different reliable sources each stating different dates. Do you see the issue? -

<user_id=Locke Cole>
But only one of those sources is available in print which is a hell of a lot more credible than a website (which literally anyone can make on their own). — •  •

<user_id=Zomic13>
But IGN and Gamespot aren't websites that ""just anyone made"". They are legit businesses and their websites are entirely credible. Also, you're not even citing a print source - you're citing a website as well. Technically 1up.com isn't even the website for any print magazines - it's just part of the same games network under Ziff Davis Media, therefore it should fall under the same criticisms as any other website. -

<user_id=Locke Cole>
I'm sorry, but that doesn't make any sense. — •  •

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Argument about reliability of sources**: The discussion begins with a debate over the reliability of various sources for a video game release date. Benifb is concerned about the changing release dates and the lack of an official announcement from Nintendo. Locke Cole argues that 1UP.com, being associated with Electronic Gaming Monthly, is a reliable source and that Wikipedia should not use official announcements as they are primary sources.

2. **Primary vs. secondary sources**: Locke Cole's point about Wikipedia's preference for secondary sources over primary sources is valid in the context of Wikipedia's guidelines. However, this argument seems to be used to justify the use of 1UP.com's date without considering the inconsistency of the information from 1UP.com itself.

3. **Consistency of information**: Zomic13 and Benifb both point out that different reliable sources are giving different dates, which suggests that there is no consensus on the release date. This is a strong argument for not listing a specific date until there is an official announcement or a consensus among reliable sources.

4. **Print vs. online sources**: Locke Cole argues that 1UP.com is more credible because it is associated with a print publication. Zomic13 counters this by saying that being a print publication does not inherently make a source more reliable than a dedicated online publication like IGN or Gamespot, which also have established reputations.

5. **Editorial discretion**: Zomic13 suggests that by choosing one source over another, editors are making a guess, which goes against Wikipedia's policy on original research. This is a compelling argument for neutrality and avoiding the appearance of favoritism among sources.

6. **Final arguments and official announcement**: The discussion ends with a user mentioning that Nintendo officially said 4/27, which, if true, would resolve the issue. However, this claim is not substantiated within the discussion.

Overall, the arguments presented show an understanding of Wikipedia's policies on verifiability and reliable sources. There is a clear tension between the desire to provide specific information and the need to ensure that information is accurate and verifiable. The participants are engaged and provide reasoned arguments, but there is a lack of consensus on how to proceed when reliable sources disagree.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Elonka>
Prester John

<user_id=Elonka>
I'm not sure it's accurate to say that the monarch in the image in this article was Prester John.

<user_id=Latebird>
No, that's definitively not accurate. Prester John was/is a legend, and Toghrul is only one of the people brought into connection with it. Since it has no real connection to the rest of this article anyway, I've removed that statement.

<user_id=Elonka>
Thanks.  BTW, I'm not sure if you've been following the situation, but we're currently embarking on major cleanup because of an editor (PHG) who's been adding dubious information to multiple Mongol-related articles.  If you'd like to help, the list is at Talk:Franco-Mongol alliance#List of articles for review.  And a related ArbCom case is at Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Franco-Mongol alliance (see the evidence/workshop pages for more info).

<user_id=Elonka>
Can you please re-check the ISBN? It's not pulling up for me.  The only Gousset book I'm finding, is one where she published Marco Polo's book ''Livre des Merveilles''.  In which case we should be sourcing Marco Polo, not Gousset, or at least we should be sourcing both of them. Or if, as you say, Ong Khan was ""well known"" as Prester John, we can probably find a better source. Though, as Latebird said, it's not really something relevant to this article anyway.

<user_id=Latebird>
PHG, your addition does not reflect the current state of knowledge. Yes, it is true that Wang Khan was one of the people who got ""dressed up"" as the legendary ""Prester John"" during a certain limited time. But it is also very clear that we're talking about a legend here, and such an assignment was therefore necessarily purely fictional. The way you state it in the article, it looks like it was real, which is much more wrong than omitting the information alltogether. Not to mention that a legend assigned to her uncle is not really relevant to an article about an entirely different person anyway.

<user_id=Per Honor et Gloria>
The ISBN is OK. Her book is entitled ''Le Livre des Merveilles du Monde. Marco Polo'' but it is actually her making summaries of each of Marco Polo's chapters, with pictures. Of course the information is relevant. It is even highly relevant. For Westerners, she was the niece of Prester John... I'll be adding more references as I go, if you wish, but everybody who has read about the Mongols a bit knows about this.

<user_id=Per Honor et Gloria>
Really, I don't know. Sorghaghtani Beki was known in the West as the niece of Prester John. This is a very important piece of information. I am not saying she was, only that she was known as such. I'm ok if you rephrase if you have an idea for a less ambiguous sentence though. Regards.

<user_id=Per Honor et Gloria>
You'll find a lot of references are already in the Prester John article.

<user_id=Latebird>
Does your source specifically say that ""Sorghaghtani Beki was known in the West as the niece of Prester John""? Or is that your own interpretation where it just says ''he'' was known that way?

<user_id=Per Honor et Gloria>
Here is exactly my sentence in the article: ''""Sorkhokhtani was the niece of the Kereyid leader Wang Khan ""Toghrul"", described as ""Prester John"" in the Occident.""'' The quote is used to reference the connection between Wang Khan and the legend of Prester John (""Cet Ong Khan, plus connu en Occident sous le nom de Pretre Jean"", in ""Le Livre des Merveilles, Marco Polo"", Marie-Therese Gousset, p.42). For a reference connecting at the same time Sorkhokhtani, Wang Khan and Prester John see for example ''Genghis Khan, His Life and Legacy'' by Paul Ratchnevsky p.80 .

<user_id=Aramgar>
I must agree with  mention of Ong Khan’s connection to the Prester John myth in this article is not really relevant; still less the inclusion of a wholly imaginary representation of Prester John from a western European manuscript. If Sorghaghtani Beki was known in the West as the niece of Prester John, this attribution was not widespread. Let us not place undue weight on a single comment by Marie-Therese Gousset.

<user_id=Per Honor et Gloria>
Need some more? Just looking at Google Books, for authors refering to Sorghaghtani Beki (mother of Möngke Khan, Kublai Khan, Hulagu Khan and Ariq Boke) as the niece of Prester John, see:  China and the Far East by George Hubbard Blakeslee (p.251): ''""He was kindly received by the great Kublai Khan—whose mother was a Christian, '''a niece of Prester John'''""'',  China and Religion - Page 187 by Edward Harper. Parker: ''""the mother of Mangu (and of Kublai, '''a niece of ""Prester John'''"")'',  The Call of Cathay by William Arthur Cornaby, S. George Tope Page 49: ''""Kublai Khan (whose mother was '''niece of ""Prester John'''"")''. I think that's more than enough sources presenting Sorghaghtani Beki as the niece of Prester John. Actually, it would be quite a lapse not to mention that fact.

<user_id=Aramgar>
(unindent) Among the sources you cite, Parker and Tope place the name Prester John in quotation marks. The use of quotation marks in this fashion indicates that the author is distancing himself from the statement. No one here doubts that the historical Ong Khan was associated in the minds of some Westerners with the mythical Prester John; but making an absolute statement that Sorghaghtani Beki ''was'' the niece of Prester John is silly. If you insist on placing a statement about Prester John in this article, it would be appropriate to say that some Westerners connected Ong Khan with Prester John. I am not, however, convinced that the mention is actually necessary.

<user_id=Per Honor et Gloria>
I never made ""an absolute statement that Sorghaghtani Beki ''was'' the niece of Prester John"". Look at what I wrote exactly: '''''""Sorkhokhtani was the niece of the Kereyid leader Wang Khan ""Toghrul"", described as ""Prester John"" in the Occident.""''''' For more accuracy we could indeed correct to ""sometimes described"". It is important to remind this fact when talking about Sorghaghtani Beki, just as many historians do.

<user_id=Latebird>
You still haven't explained the point. The books you cite that bring Sorghaghtani Beki more or less directly into connection with ""Prester John"" are all about a hundred years old, and they all at best mention the connection in passing. One of them is even badly enough researched to take the legend as fact. Remember that we're talking about an incorrect name that ''certain circles'' liked to assign to Wang Khan (as well as to several other people) ''during a very limited time''. That was clearly not more than a side note to ''his'' life, if he took notice of it at all. It was (and is) entirely irrelevant to Sorghaghtani Bekis life. It is neither necessary nor encyclopedic to add such a tendentious tidbit to every article where Wang Khan happens to be mentioned. In fact, it looks more like a public relations campaign and POV pushing.

<user_id=Per Honor et Gloria>
Need more sources? These 100 year old sources are all that were available on Google books. For a modern Internet source, please see for example John M.L Young: ''""Mangu's mother too was a Christian (a niece of Prester John), as was also his wife.""'' (1984). I don't have the time to research print ressources on this micro-subject, and don't wish to spend energy on such a ridiculous argument, but it is just obvious that Sorghaghtani Beki has often been referred to as ""the niece of Prester John"", which is an obvious thing to state on an article about her. It is just a matter of common-sense to mention it: it is part of her history. It is like arguing that we shouldn't mention that king Louis XIV was called ""'''Le Roi Soleil'''"", on the grounds that it is a lie because he was not actually the sun: wouldn't it be totally ridiculous??? It is the same here. The way people are designated through history is part of their history indeed.

<user_id=Latebird>
Yet more ""sources"" researched badly enough to present a legend as fact?  Toghrul then even becomes Ghengis' physical uncle... And Le Roi-Soleil is a blatant red herring, because that name was specifically coined for him as a unique synonym, which is not the case here at all.

<user_id=Per Honor et Gloria>
What do you mean ""Toghrul then even becomes Ghengis' physical uncle""?

<user_id=Latebird>
Maybe you want to actually read the ""source"" you just cited from?

<user_id=Per Honor et Gloria>
Sure. Toghrul had allied to Yesugei the father of Ghengis Khan through a ritual that made him his ""Blood brother"" (or ""Frere de sang"" in French. By the way, this is mentionned in the Blood brother article.). It is well known and also reported by other historians such as Jean-Paul Roux. By the way Young does not say ""physical"" uncle, just ""uncle"", which is true by virtue of this ceremony. What is your problem with that?

<user_id=Latebird>
My father's blood brother isn't normally called my uncle without qualification. It's very obvious that your ""source"" didn't understand the distinction (or blurred it deliberately). There's a lot more non-historical nonsense in that text, I just picked one of the most glaringly obvious examples. Not every text out there is a valid source, just because someone, somewhere has written it. To use it here, you need to show that it's reliable. You have been criticized for using ""sources"" inappropriately many times before, but apparently you are either unable or unwilling to learn from that.

<user_id=Per Honor et Gloria>
So you're saying that George Hubbard Blakeslee, Edward Harper, William Arthur Cornaby, S. George Tope and John M.L Young are all unreliable historians, but  is right? This is ridiculous, Latebird. We are only saying that Sorghaghtani has been called the ""niece of Prester John"" through history, which is a pretty straightforward claim knowing that her uncle Wang Khan was himself known as Prester John, and which is documented (above) by numerous sources. This is a significant view, and per Wikipedia:NPOV all significant views should be represented: this is even considered as ""non negotiable"" . I have only relied on Google Books or Internet for this search, but it is quite obvious that numerous others books would present this queen as ""the niece of Prester John"", or ""the niece of ""Prester John"""" as well. This is fully relevant to an article on Sorghaghtani.

<user_id=Latebird>
(undent)
You brought those names up, so it's your task to show whether they're reliable (eg. not outdated by a hundred years) or even just historians. Your last example (John M. L. Young) is neither, but instead a modern day missionary, who evidently distorts history to ""support"" his personal belief system. Some of the others put ""Prester John"" in quotes, correctly distancing themselfes from the story. Those who don't do that (assuming that you're quoting them correctly and completely) may indeed not be as reliable as you seem to think.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. The discussion revolves around whether Sorghaghtani Beki should be referred to as the niece of Prester John in a Wikipedia article. The debate is about historical accuracy and the relevance of this information to the article.

2. User Elonka raises concerns about the accuracy of associating the image of a monarch with Prester John and mentions a broader issue of dubious information being added to Mongol-related articles.

3. User Latebird agrees with Elonka, stating that Prester John is a legend and that the association with Toghrul is purely fictional and not relevant to the article in question.

4. User Per Honor et Gloria argues that the information is relevant and provides sources to support the claim that Sorghaghtani Beki was known as the niece of Prester John.

5. User Aramgar points out that the sources cited by Per Honor et Gloria are either outdated or use quotation marks to indicate the legendary status of Prester John, suggesting that the authors are distancing themselves from the claim.

6. User Latebird challenges the reliability of the sources provided by Per Honor et Gloria, noting that some are outdated and others may not be historians or may have distorted history to fit personal beliefs.

7. The discussion shows a back-and-forth between the users, with some emphasizing the importance of historical accuracy and relevance, while others focus on the representation of historical figures in popular or past conceptions.

8. The quality of the arguments varies. Some users provide evidence and sources for their claims, while others question the validity and relevance of those sources. There is a clear effort to maintain the integrity of the Wikipedia article and ensure that the information presented is accurate and relevant.

9. The discussion is civil, and each user provides reasons for their position, even though there is disagreement. This indicates a healthy debate focused on improving the content of the article.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5. The score reflects the participants' engagement with the topic, the use of sources, and the civil nature of the debate, despite some arguments being based on potentially outdated or irrelevant sources.",7.5

Why do you feel that an arrest warrant that is ''completely'' unrelated to WikiLeaks belongs in this article, and under '''legal status''' to boot?

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User TucsonDavid argues for the inclusion of Julian Assange's arrest in the WikiLeaks article under the 'legal status' section, citing WP:NPOV (Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View policy) as the basis for their argument. They suggest that the CEO's legal issues are relevant to the company's image and could be related to recent leaks.

2. User Nymf questions the relevance of Assange's arrest to the legal status of WikiLeaks, pointing out that the arrest is unrelated to the website's activities.

3. User Smartse asks for strong sources to support the claim that Assange's arrest is related to WikiLeaks and challenges the notion that excluding this information violates NPOV.

4. User Ianmacm emphasizes that there is a consensus not to link Assange's personal legal issues with the legal status of WikiLeaks. They also mention WP:CRYSTAL, which advises against speculation about future events, and remind that the article in question is about the website, not a biography of Assange.

5. User TucsonDavid adds a POV tag to the article, indicating they believe there is a bias in the discussion, and agrees to consolidate the discussion in one place.

6. User Ianmacm further clarifies that the legal status of WikiLeaks is separate from Assange's personal legal issues and that the latter should be discussed in Assange's biography, not the WikiLeaks article.

Evaluation of Arguments:

- User TucsonDavid's argument is based on the assumption that the CEO's legal troubles are inherently relevant to the company's legal status. However, they do not provide strong evidence or sources to support this claim, which weakens their argument.
  
- User Nymf's argument is concise and to the point, questioning the relevance of the arrest to the article's subject matter without delving into the specifics of the policies.

- User Smartse's argument is strong as it asks for evidence to support the claim and directly addresses the NPOV concern raised by TucsonDavid.

- User Ianmacm's argument is also strong, as it is grounded in Wikipedia's policies and guidelines (WP:CRYSTAL and the distinction between a website's legal status and an individual's biography).

Overall, the arguments from Nymf, Smartse, and Ianmacm are more aligned with Wikipedia's guidelines and policies, and they provide a clear rationale for why Assange's arrest should not be included in the WikiLeaks article's 'legal status' section. TucsonDavid's argument lacks the same level of policy support and evidence.

Overuse of Quotes in Lead

The quoted phrases in the lead are misleading and detract from the readability of the text. If these are indeed quotes, I could not find them in the cited source (try finding ""sexual brokenness that may be healed through faith in Jesus Christ."" in [7]). If they are being used to say something is so-called, then what is subjective about ""renouncing homosexuality""? If you look up renounce in the dictionary, that is exactly what they are asking people to do. What should be done here?  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=Jenova20>
They are quotes because they are from the organisation themselves and are magical claims of curing gay people of being. If they were not in quotes then they would be in Wikipedia's voice and violate WP:Weight, thus having to be removed completely. All organizations tend to have a mission statement or similar information and notable quotes. ""Renouncing homosexuality"" is a perfect example - it is their words, not ours. Renouncing is very controversial in this case since sexuality is not an addiction or a habit you can ""renounce"" and HA leaders themselves admit that homosexuality is incurable. The organization only live on because people and churches still ignore that and fund them anyway. If i missed anything there then let me know. Thanks ''' (email)'''

<user_id=202.93.155.225>
You missed any mention of the missing quote, ""sexual brokenness that may be healed through faith in Jesus Christ."" I don't think anything about the word renounce suggests that homosexuality is a habit. Can you clarify? My point was that it should be in Wikipedia's voice as there's nothing misleading about describing what they urge people to do.

<user_id=Jenova20>
Sexual brokenness"" is a quote, so we do not put it in Wikipedia's voice. And the part about healing with Jesus is not a scientific or the mainstream view, so it does not go in Wikipedia's voice as it would violate WP:Weight. Wikipedia uses science and reliable sources for articles. Conservapedia is the one that uses the Bible and quotes from magical and mythical creatures. Did i get it all? Thanks ''' (email)'''

<user_id=27.32.152.121>
Right, so if ""sexual brokenness"" is a quote, don't you think the quote should be reined in a little so as not to mislead and/or make the paragraph unreadable? The part about healing through faith in Jesus is not scientific, but the sentence starts with ""HA regards sexuality as"". I don't think anybody would confuse this with Wikipedia's voice. You did not clarify what you believe constitutes weight the phrase ""renounce homosexuality"".

One more thing. Regarding the voice issue, I think you might be referring to this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view

They're still quotes after that section, hence the speech marks. With a topic like this making such outlandish claims we have to be careful to explain those without putting it in Wikipedia's voice. And as you can see there are multiple policies to adhere to with something like this. So we must carefully explain what the company does without making it seem factual, as the citations from the company themselves cannot be used for that. WP:NPOV, WP:WEIGHT, WP:Reliable...there's a few to be aware of. The fact of the matter is that we cannot put these things into Wikipedia's voice, but we must explain what the company does.

- The first user is focused on readability and factual representation, which is important for the quality of a Wikipedia article.
- The second user is focused on adhering to Wikipedia's policies, which is crucial for maintaining the encyclopedia's standards.
- The discussion remains civil and both users provide reasons for their positions, although there is a lack of resolution or compromise in the dialogue.
- The discussion could benefit from a third-party opinion or additional sources to clarify the disputed points.

Considering the above points, the discussion shows an understanding of Wikipedia's policies and a concern for the accuracy and neutrality of the article. However, the lack of resolution and the potential for improved clarity in the arguments suggest that there is room for improvement in the quality of the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Crtew>
Citations for Section ""Personal""

<user_id=Crtew>
has challenged the references in the personal section which show a connection between Bergman and his wife and father in law. He deleted the entire section. I have restored the section and added the appropriate templates that challenge the facts and citations. Sufficient time should be given to find  the sources. It seemed extreme to delete them and not let anyone know about this on the talk page. This is an announcement that DS has a point but the community of editors interested may try to fill in the gaps and come up with better references that are not from blogs or citizen journalists. I have taken the matter into my own hands as DS as refused to restore the material or raise the matter here. This is what talk pages are for.

<user_id=Darkness Shines>
Do not restore BLP violations, I have reverted you. It was explained on my talk page why those sources cannot be used in a BLP, yet you restored it? Do not do this again please.

<user_id=Crtew>
DS, Your last edit seems more like war editing. You need to explain here in the appropriate place why we can't have access to the material with templates placed. The appropriate templates of DUBIOUS and FACT were put in place to signal questioned points of matter. How are we to reasonably discuss this matter or to improve upon the copy without access? Furthermore, DS has clearly violated WP:3R with the initial revert, another later edit that deletes the section (which is another form of revert, and this latest incident? How can we move on in a reasonable way and without strife? Any proposals?

<user_id=Crtew>
DS keeps saying that BLP allows him to delete without debate material. While I agree BLP asks for strict sources and I also applaud DS for questioning the sources in the article, I believe he misses the spirit of BLP. The idea is that this is about a living person and so the facts have to be right. The facts in this case are poorly sourced, however, the facts are not as controversial as the edit warring (see above) indicates. The blog is from the person who the article is about. So if the source says a fact, it is not verified but it is not controversial. What we're talking about here is verification.  DS seems to be saying the fact is false in his use of BLP to delete and not allow for reasonable requests for scrutiny. This is a misuse of WP:BLP policy.

<user_id=Darkness Shines>
The blog source is used to support content with regards to two other living people, not just Bergman. Another source is to a website which has user generated content on it, another nono for a BLP. BLP policy is very clear on this. There is nothing to discuss, restore it when you have decent sources which adhere to policy.

<user_id=Crtew>
DS now acknowledges that the Blog is associated with Bergman but adds that it also has other writers. I accept this as a fact. The key word in WP:BLP is that the fact discussed is ""contentious"". What DS is saying contradicts this contentious standard because Bergman is represented on this site as connected to the family. What is the problem here is additional verification. There should be NO PROBLEM with allowing the community of editors access to material so that this verification can happen. Policy is there not to enslave us but to give us guidelines on to act consistently and in the best interests of the project.

<user_id=Darkness Shines>
That is not what I wrote, I wrote the blog was being used to source information not just on Bergman, but on two other BLP's. And that quite simply is the end of it.

<user_id=Crtew>
Then you can quote policy in WP:BLP that supports this for non-contentious situations. Quote also the sections for the same for citizen journalists.

<user_id=Crtew>
What is the use of templates like DUBIOUS or CITATIONS NEEDED? You've given no reason why we can't find a middle ground.

<user_id=Crtew>
The gist of all of the above is that you (DS) should attempt to communicate clearly and exactly how the policy applies in this situation or context. You keep repeating the same point over and over again (with minimal mentions of BLP) and not making connections from policies to facts. I apologize if I have mischaracterized you DS but you don't seem to be communicative unless you're reverting edits. Furthermore, when you are reverting others, there is no dispassionate or clear explanation in your editing comments (exampe: ""erm, no""), which leaves me with the strong impression that this is more about a power game than it is about improving this particular article. However, I'm open to being corrected in this matter.

<user_id=Crtew>
Or you need to also explain how this fact is contentious?
In addition, the facts are contained in a blog that also falls WP:SELFPUB, which is within the WP:BLP.

<user_id=Darkness Shines>
WP:SELFPUBLISH ""Never use self-published sources as third-party sources about living people, even if the author is an expert, well-known professional researcher, or writer."" WP:BLP ""Contentious material about living persons (or recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced – whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable – should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion"" Given the shite sources being used are making the claim that he has a wife and naming her along with her dad, and that this wife represented a well known BLP is contentious IMO. Now I really cannot be arsed to continue a pointless discussion, get decent sources. Funny thing of course is that none of that information belongs here anyway, the article is about Bergman, not his missus nor who she supposedly represented nor about his dainlaw.

<user_id=Crtew>
Of course, you didn't read lower then your quote on self pub where it also includes a section ""Using the subject as a self-published source"". And of course you fail to state how the facts are contentious, which is the cornerstone of the point you quote. You want to make everything all encompanssing to suit your purposes. I note by the way in history that you've not made a single, poistive additive edit. So I can see there is no way to be reasonable with you about the definition of contentious, even as you belittle the point. Lastly, there is no need for crude expressions in WP TALK. Please learn to clean up your language.

<user_id=Darkness Shines>
Restore those bollocks refs again and I will report your continuing violations of BLP policy.

<user_id=Crtew>
At this point, I'm not having a discussion with you. You've more than violated WP:3R and you refuse me any chance to be productive.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. <user_id=Crtew> begins by addressing the issue of deleted content and the need for better references, suggesting that the deletion was extreme and advocating for a discussion on the talk page. This user is attempting to follow Wikipedia's collaborative editing process by restoring the section with tags that indicate the content is disputed, which is a reasonable approach to invite further scrutiny and improvement of the article.

2. <user_id=Darkness Shines> responds by emphasizing the importance of adhering to Wikipedia's Biography of Living Persons (BLP) policy, which requires high-quality sources for information about living individuals. This user's concern for BLP compliance is valid and shows an understanding of Wikipedia's policies.

3. <user_id=Crtew> argues that while the sources are poorly sourced, the facts are not controversial and suggests that the deletion of the material prevents community scrutiny and improvement. This user is advocating for a more nuanced application of the BLP policy, which is a fair point in the context of improving the article while adhering to Wikipedia's guidelines.

4. <user_id=Darkness Shines> reiterates the policy, stating that the blog source is not acceptable for information about other living people, not just the subject of the article. This user is strictly interpreting the BLP policy, which is within their right, but may be overlooking the potential for non-contentious material to be improved with better sourcing.

5. <user_id=Crtew> requests specific policy quotes from <user_id=Darkness Shines> to support their actions and questions the use of templates like DUBIOUS or CITATIONS NEEDED if the material cannot be discussed. This user is seeking a compromise and a clearer explanation of policy application.

6. <user_id=Darkness Shines> provides quotes from the BLP policy and argues that the material is contentious and therefore should be removed. This user is standing firm on their interpretation of the policy but does not engage in a constructive dialogue about how to improve the content.

7. <user_id=Crtew> points out a section of the policy that allows the use of self-published sources under certain conditions and challenges <user_id=Darkness Shines> to explain how the facts are contentious. This user is trying to engage in a policy-based discussion but is met with resistance.

8. <user_id=Darkness Shines> ends the conversation with a threat to report <user_id=Crtew> for policy violations, which is not conducive to a collaborative editing environment.

Overall, the discussion starts with an attempt to engage in a constructive dialogue about improving the article while adhering to Wikipedia's policies. However, it devolves into a less productive exchange with one party resorting to threats rather than engaging in a collaborative resolution. The quality of the arguments varies, with both users presenting valid points but failing to reach a consensus or productive outcome.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 4.5",4.5
"<user_id=Collect>
Clear POV fork which actually is full of copyvios from Mayer et al.

<user_id=Rd232>
Fork of... what? Much of the content is rejected for inclusion at Koch Family Foundations, and there is (AFAIK) no existing page which summarises the family's political activities. The text is largely copied from existing pages or old versions of Koch Family Foundations, so any copyvios (such as?) have been transferred thusly.

<user_id=MBMadmirer>
I am curious if there are any analogous pages? People like George Soros and Peter Lewis on the left have comparable engagement in US politics. Richard Mellon Scaife has been compared to Koch. The only comparable page I can find is George Soros conspiracy theories. Thoughts?

<user_id=Collect>
(ec) Clear copyvio of Mayer. Material ''already'' in Koch Industries, David Koch, Charles Koch, Fred Koch, Koch family, Americans for Prosperity, Koch Family Foundations, Politics of global warming (United States), Tea Party movement, and Richard Fink. Seems more than enough places on WP for the opinions of Mayer, no? 10 articles all with her opinion that the Kochs are evil incarnate.

<user_id=Arthur Rubin>
Rename to ""Mayer's view of the Koch family""?  I don't see it as copyvios, but just WP:NPOV and WP:UNDUE violations.  (And, if deleted, the material added here should '''not''' be returned to the articles it was copied from without due consideration of WP:BLP, WP:NPOV, and relevance.)  —

<user_id=Rd232>
I don't know, are there analogous ''cases''? You cite individuals, whose activities are obviously handled in their own bios (eg George_Soros#Political_donations_and_activism), though they may be spun off WP:SUMMARY-style in the usual way if necessary. By contrast, the way in which the activities of the different members of the Koch family overlap, as individuals and via their company and via their foundations, makes a single page to bring these together (as some sources do) a different proposition than discussion of each of those separately in their own entries.

<user_id=Rd232>
Obviously the article needs expansion - WP:IMPERFECT; but it's not like it's based on a single source.

<user_id=Arthur Rubin>
The article needs contraction, removing ""information"" and sources which clearly violate WP:BLP.  I removed 2 of the references to Mayer's interview as being clearly ''her'' opinion, but Rich's article is an Op-Ed, which is not reliable for questions of fact, only (at best) of notability.  I haven't gone through the rest of the references for credibility.  —

<user_id=Rd232>
Well, those same issues are strewn across various related articles; that's inevitable when the subject of the article touches on so many things! Bringing them all together in one place allows all this material to be considered in the appropriate wider perspective, and improved, and the resulting improvements later carried over to related articles. It would be ''easier'' not to bother, and just leave everything to simmer quietly, but this will ultimately produce higher quality. The different context, for instance, can encourage a more scholarly and less personalistic approach, focussing on facts and their significance. Mayer may have brought this to public attention, but there are certainly other sources. It needs a lot of work, though.

<user_id=MBMadmirer>
I don't know about that. For example Soros Fund Management (the company) gave money to 527s, their PAC gave money to candidates, the various foundations associated with him give money to things. Because these are two brothers, it is a whole different category? That seems like a stretch. If anything the closest analogy is the George Soros conspiracy theories where crazy people over-project for political reasons onto people.

<user_id=Rd232>
I don't really know what you're getting at, but I have no objection in principle to Political activities of George Soros, if that helps any.

<user_id=Collect>
10 articles on Soros?  I doubt it.  The same stuff is being peddled in 10 articles here - and it is all opinion in any case.

<user_id=Rd232>
it is all opinion in any case - I'm going to nominate Charles Koch co-founding the Cato Institute (sourced to Cato) as my black swan.

<user_id=Arthur Rubin>
Well, we should have a third party source.... —

<user_id=Rd232>
For that? Not really.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **<user_id=Collect>** raises a concern about copyright violations (copyvios) from Mayer et al. and suggests that the material is redundant as it is already present in multiple Wikipedia articles.

2. **<user_id=Rd232>** responds by clarifying the uniqueness of the page in question, which summarizes the political activities of the Koch family, and argues that the text is largely copied from existing pages, implying that any copyright issues would have been pre-existing.

3. **<user_id=MBMadmirer>** brings up the question of whether there are analogous pages for other individuals with similar political engagement, suggesting that if there are, it would justify the existence of the page in question.

4. **<user_id=Collect>** again emphasizes the redundancy and opinionated nature of the content, suggesting that the opinions of Mayer are overrepresented across multiple articles.

5. **<user_id=Arthur Rubin>** suggests a possible renaming of the article to reflect that it represents Mayer's view and points out that the article may have neutrality and undue weight issues, rather than copyright violations.

6. **<user_id=Rd232>** argues for the utility of having a single page that brings together the various activities of the Koch family, which are spread across different articles, for better context and improvement of content.

7. **<user_id=Arthur Rubin>** suggests that the article needs to be contracted to remove information that violates Wikipedia's biography of living persons policy (WP:BLP).

8. **<user_id=Rd232>** acknowledges the need for work on the article but maintains that the consolidation of information can lead to higher quality content.

9. **<user_id=MBMadmirer>** and **<user_id=Rd232>** discuss the analogy with George Soros and whether a separate page for political activities is warranted.

10. **<user_id=Collect>** and **<user_id=Rd232>** debate the extent of opinion-based content and the need for third-party sources.

The discussion shows a range of perspectives on the issue of content redundancy, neutrality, and the representation of political figures on Wikipedia. The participants engage in a back-and-forth that touches on Wikipedia's core content policies, such as neutrality (WP:NPOV), verifiability (WP:VER), and the policy on biographies of living persons (WP:BLP). The arguments presented are generally coherent and relevant to the topic at hand, with participants citing specific Wikipedia policies and guidelines to support their points. The dialogue also reflects a concern for the balance between comprehensive coverage and the potential for undue weight given to certain viewpoints.

However, the discussion could benefit from more direct engagement with the specific content in question and a clearer consensus on how to address the issues raised. While there is some disagreement, the participants are civil and focused on improving the encyclopedia, which is a positive aspect of the discussion quality.

Considering the above points, the discussion is constructive, policy-oriented, and shows an effort to resolve the issue collaboratively, despite some disagreements.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5
"<user_id=W. B. Wilson>
Name

<user_id=W. B. Wilson>
I am dismayed that you have moved the name of the article to include the ń character.  I have nothing against the Polish alphabet - but this is the English language Wiki, and in the English language the city is known as ""Poznan"", and references to the battle written in English also use ""Poznan"".  Ziemke and Duffy's works are examples of this.  I kindly request you move article's name to the original title.  ""Battle of Poznań"" would be good as a redirect for the occasional Polish user of the English Wiki.

<user_id=Piotrus>
The name of the city is Poznań. When you succeed in moving it to Poznan, I promise I will support moving the battle back to battle of Poznan (1945).|

<user_id=W. B. Wilson>
Piotrus, that is disingenuous.  This is an English-language Wiki.  In English works, the city's name -is- Poznan with no characters used from other languages.  See, for example, the article Munich.  The name of the article for the city is given in its English name which makes good sense for users of an English Wiki, even though the city's residents call it ''München''.
Frankly, your name move is unhelpful and exactly the sort of thing that kicks off edit wars.  I've seen very fine editing on your part and find it hard to understand both your edit and your attitude in this case.
And rest assured I know the Polish name for Poznan and many other Polish locales as well.  I am no enemy of Poland.  It is simply that are some rules that make sense for an English-language Wiki, and imposing foreign language characters on article names makes little sense.

<user_id=Piotrus>
W. B. The issue of diacritics has been discussed in the past. Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English) notes the issue is has not been resolved but there were more in favor of diacritics in titles than not. See also Wikipedia:Naming conventions (standard letters with diacritics) and note it was rejected. Finally, use of diacritics has become a standard practice over the years. If you feel strongly about it, feel free to start a WP:RM to the original title; I believe the one with diacritic is more correct.|

<user_id=W. B. Wilson>
Thanks for the suggestion.  My time here, however, is limited and I prefer not to spend it engaging Wikipedia processes in cases that in my consideration are fairly obvious.  For the same reason, I find edit wars to be wasted time.
This article may become what it will.

<user_id=Piotrus>
Personally I consider the naming disputes a giant waste of time compared to creating content so I hope this indeed will not be a  major issue.|

<user_id=Mrg3105>
Naming disputes are created by people like yourself who insist on nationalisation of English Wikipedia. This is regardless of the fact that I will still type in Poznan every time because I am not going to change the keyboard layout for every instance I need to look at a location in Poland. However, there is such a thing called History, and it is recorded regardless of personal preferences of those who try to rewrite it. If you're not taking any flack, you're not over the target.

<user_id=Piotrus>
I resent being accused of nationalism. Please mind WP:AGF and WP:NPA. Redirects where created for a reason, and we are not going to be dumbing down complex words to simple ones. I don't have é on my keyboard, but I certainly don't mind ''café''. And I don't expect you to type Poznań with ń, but it is the name of the city, not Poznan. Thousands of English language publications agree. My, nationalism is on the rise, indeed.|

<user_id=Mrg3105>
There is no ń in English, or café for that matter. There is no need for a redirect if the title of the article is Battle of Poznan. Changing an English title into a Polish one is nationalising of the title. WP:AGF and WP:NPA have nothing to do with it! You are changing the spelling from English to Polish. What would you call it?!  If you're not taking any flack, you're not over the target.

<user_id=Piotrus>
Being correct.|

<user_id=Mrg3105>
But you are only correct in Polish! In English, and we are editing in English Wikipedia, you are not correct. You would also '''not''' be correct in Russian, Turkish, Hindu, and Chinese to name a few. Do you see my point? You are imposing your own POV and spelling convention on the English language users, and using redirects for which there is absolutely no need.  If you're not taking any flack, you're not over the target.

<user_id=Piotrus>
Please show me a policy that this name contradicts. And WP:UE is invalid since in my post from above I have shown that the ń version is extensively used in English. Hence it is Poznan that is the misspelling (or a Redirect from title without diacritics, to be precise). |

<user_id=Mrg3105>
With all due respect Piotr, you have not shown anything! Please see here [] for use of accents in English and English words with diacritics. I also refer you to the English alphabet. If I choose to write cafe, no one is going to fault me for it in common English usage. It is just unreasonable to impose the need to have knowledge of all the different languages that use diacritics on the English language users of Wikipedia. That would be the result of what you are suggesting if applied consistently throughout the English Wikipedia projects.   If you're not taking any flack, you're not over the target.

<user_id=Piotrus>
Indeed, the world is bigger then just its English speaking part. This is also why we have redirects. I don't expect most English speakers to know most diacritics. That doesn't mean they don't exist in English language. Ignorance is not an excuse.|

<user_id=Mrg3105>
Are you suggesting that non-use of diacritics is a sign of ignorance?! Not one school in Australia teaches it, and I got though a university degree without using it while being taught by lecturers from six different countries! Redirects are also used for disambiguation of English events (in this case) and the tag is {{R from historic name}}. However if you see the page Wikipedia:Redirect#Alternative_names you will see the example Byzantium, Istanbul and Constantinople, and not {lang-tr|'''İ'''stanbul}  If you're not taking any flack, you're not over the target.

<user_id=Mrg3105>
People should familiarise themselves with the Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names). Based on this policy, the geographic names need to use naming that reflects English usage, and use during historical period.   If you're not taking any flak, you're not over the target.

<user_id=Piotrus>
Indeed. And the name was Poznań. Hence, everything is fine.|

<user_id=Mrg3105>
Indeed nothing. Please answer the following questions:
Is the editing being done in English language Wikipedia?
Does the English language have a usage for letter '''ń''' in its alphabet?
If you're not taking any flak, you're not over the target.

<user_id=Piotrus>
I have answered above.|

<user_id=Mrg3105>
To clarify, User_talk:Piotrus asserts that:
English users are ignorant on the use of diacritics, and in fact the English alphabet does contain letter '''ń'''.  If you're not taking any flak, you're not over the target.

<user_id=Piotrus>
I have no intention to continue this discussion, particularly when you insist of misrepresenting my arguments.|

<user_id=Mrg3105>
I wish I could misrepresent your arguments Piotr, because you haven't offered any other then to suggest that I am ignorant in the use of English language. You steadfastly refuse to acknowledge that Poznań may have a different spelling outside of Poland, and in this case in an English language society. Would you have been so insistent if the similarity had been less apparent in another language, as in say Greek Πόζναν?  If you're not taking any flak, you're not over the target.

<user_id=Radomil>
Well, I'm native speaker of Polish language, but it doesn't mean that I am specialist in writing foreing names in Polish. On the other hand I often use name of Poznań in dialogues with native English speakers. Currently the most spread form is ""Poznań"" in favor of ""Poznan"" and most rarely derived from German ""Posen"" (which is usually treated as ""faux pas"" if it is used in other that historical context)

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Argument about English Language Conventions**: W. B. Wilson argues that the English Wikipedia should use the English language conventions, which typically do not include diacritics like ""ń"". This is a valid point, as English speakers may not be familiar with such characters and may not use them when searching for information.

2. **Precedent and Wikipedia Policies**: Piotrus points out that the use of diacritics has been discussed in the past and that there is a precedent for using them in English Wikipedia titles. This is also a valid argument, as Wikipedia does have policies and past discussions that can guide current practices.

3. **Practicality and User Experience**: Mrg3105 raises the issue of practicality, noting that most English keyboards do not have diacritics and that it would be inconvenient for users to change keyboard layouts. This is a practical consideration that affects user experience.

4. **Historical and Cultural Accuracy**: Piotrus argues for the correctness of using ""Poznań"" based on its extensive use in English language publications. This argument is about maintaining historical and cultural accuracy, which is important for an encyclopedia.

5. **Nationalism and Bias**: Mrg3105 accuses Piotrus of nationalism by insisting on the Polish spelling, which Piotrus refutes. This part of the discussion is less about the quality of the argument and more about the tone and personal accusations, which detract from the overall quality of the discussion.

6. **Consistency Across Wikipedia**: Mrg3105 also brings up the need for consistency in English Wikipedia, which is a valid point. Consistency helps users navigate and understand content better.

7. **Final Input from Radomil**: Radomil provides a perspective as a native Polish speaker, noting that ""Poznań"" is the most spread form in English, which supports Piotrus's argument about the use of diacritics in English publications.

Overall, the discussion includes several valid points on both sides regarding language conventions, Wikipedia policies, practicality, historical accuracy, and consistency. However, the quality of the discussion is somewhat diminished by the personal accusations and the lack of willingness to continue the discussion constructively towards the end.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Herbxue>
Inappropriate conclusion in lede of article

<user_id=Herbxue>
The end of the lede currently concludes that although TCM has some proponents, it is largely ""irrational pseudoscience"". This statement is problematic for several reasons.
1. The source for the statement is a 7 year old opinion piece. THe problem is not so much the age of the source, but the fact that one opinion is given the privilege of making the definitive value statement of the article (the last sentence of the lede).
2. The article should not be making a definitive value statement. The statement is certainly a notable and wide-spread OPINION, but it must be stated in the article WHO expressed this opinion. If not, it suggests that WP has collectively concluded that this opinion is fact. We have not.
3. Both words ""irrational"" and ""pseudoscience"" are intentionally pejorative terms - they do not add anything to the readers understanding of the issues involved, they are simply insults. If you want the reader to understand the lack of confirmation of TCM ideas by science, you can do so by simply citing the results of systematic reviews (which is what we have to do to justify a positive statement in WP med-related articles). If you don't do this, you are giving an opinion here, but presenting it as if it were fact. That is inappropriate.

<user_id=Alexbrn>
Criticism needs to be included in the lede, and since TCM is fringe this needs to be made plain according to policy. ''Nature'' seems a fine source for such a claim, and age does not matter unless there's evidence TCM has lost its pseudoscience. Of recent interest here is Jimbo's statement on this subject: see Wikipedia:Lunatic charlatans.  ||

<user_id=Herbxue>
I fully agree that criticism needs to be included, but an opinion piece in Nature does not constitute a fact that must be disproven (as you suggest), it is just an opinion. Your use of terms like fringe, pseudoscience, and lunatic charlatans shows that you are more interested in POV pushing than an honest appraisal of facts. You seem to take ""Jimbo""'s POV to mean that WP policy is to push an anti-fringe POV - that is not what he said, he said some sources are reliable and others aren't.

<user_id=Alexbrn>
Best to avoid ranting and personal attacks: you're pulling quite a few of the tactics outlined in WP:FLAT. TCM is ''obviously'' based on pseudoscience (meridians, anybody?) and that fringeiness needs to be abundantly clear in the lede according to our policy.  ||

<user_id=Herbxue>
The only thing that's obvious is that using pejorative labels is controversial, as seen in the lengthy dialogue about use of the term pseudoscience in previous talk page conversations (of which I was not the main person arguing against using the term). So, to say its obvious the article should conclude with a value judgement about an entire medical system is nonsense. This is an encyclopedia, not ""Consumer Reports"". Show, don't tell.

<user_id=Alexbrn>
Are you referring to the category discussion? Whether we use the pseudoscience ''category'' is a different question (on which I have no firm view). However, saying TCM is ""largely irrational pseudoscience"" (which the ''Nature'' piece says is ""obvious"") is fine - and not the least bit controversial, I'd have thought. Is there any serious dispute over the statement?  ||

<user_id=Herbxue>
Yes, there is. Its fine to include as long as you clearly identify, in the body of the text, who is expressing that it is irrational pseudoscience. As it is written, it implies that WP editors have come to consensus that TCM is irrational pseudoscience. We have not, but even if we did it would be Original Research to express it in this way, thus a violation of guidelines. If the statement is changed to clearly assign ownership of that opinion / conclusion, then I have no problem with it. As it is, it is inappropriate.

<user_id=Alexbrn>
So that would be a WP:FLAT No 3? – ""You must not say 'the earth is not flat' but 'according to critics of the flat-earth theory, the earth is not flat'"". Needlessly attributing uncontroversial statements risks creating the appearance of doubt or disagreement where there is none.  ||

<user_id=Herbxue>
That's a dismissal on your part, not a sincere engagement with the issue. The ""earth is not flat"" is not equivalent here. MIllions of people consider TCM to be a valuable system of medicine, don't dismiss them unless you really know them (many are accomplished scientists). I assure you, the statement is controversial and disputable. You are smart enough to know that the article as written makes a conclusion that represents an opinion, and I have made clear that I am not interested in censoring out that opinion, only in making sure it is properly attributed.

<user_id=Alexbrn>
Ha! By swaying to popular misconception we'd be in trouble with our UFO, creationist, homeopathy, etc. articles too! TCM is essentially a medieval pre-scientific belief system that has no correspondence with real science. No serious source disputes that. It's just an obvious fact which we can, and should, assert. You have provided no sources for your argument, merely: assertions (that the statement is controversial), an argumentum ad populum and a personal attack.  ||

<user_id=Herbxue>
We could if we had consensus, and we don't. Simply agree to attribute the quote to its source and you would be doing the honorable and scientific thing to do. Instead you just make comparisons to other, more marginalized subjects. TCM may not be mainstream, but it is not ""fringe"" - there is licensure in many countries and universities dedicated to the subject in Asia and accredited colleges in the U.S. There are many convergences between TCM treatments and scientifically-verified actions of substances, so your dismissal that there is ""no correspondence with real science"" just shows your ignorance of the subject. If you do not understand the subject, how can you determine what an ""obvious"" judgement of its merits is? You cannot - you are only presenting an opinion.

<user_id=Jim1138>
There are many sources stating that TCM is ""pseudoscience"". The question should be: ""Why is there only one reference calling TCM pseudoscience?"" Practitioners call TCM ""science"", yet the practitioners don't seem to perform scientific studies, so it passes the WP:DUCK test. I.e. pseudoscience. Given all of the points  has made here, the ""honorable"" and ""scientific"" thing to do here is to call it Fringe and Pseudoscience.  your behaviour here is bordering on a personal attack. Please focus on content.

<user_id=Alexbrn>
The Joseph Needham source (currently in further reading) has some good content that can be used to expand the article explaining the disjunction between TCM and science. I hope to have time to get round to this shortly (unless somebody beats me to it!).  ||

<user_id=Alexbrn>
I merely echo the mainstream, expert sources. Again, your arguments are of no use here. TCM is licensed in some countries ... so? Homeopathy is available from the National Health Service - that doesn't mean it's science. To repeat: ""Needlessly attributing uncontroversial statements risks creating the appearance of doubt or disagreement where there is none"". Show me the sources.  ||

<user_id=Herbxue>
I respectfully disagree Jim. Practitioners generally do not call TCM science, and yet often do participate in scientific studies. I have personally conducted a pilot study on a topical herbal preparation, and have the highest respect for those that conduct serious research as a career. Alexbrn gets under my skin because he defended POV-pushing edits by Dominusvobisdu that misrepresented Ernst's conclusions regarding placebo effect, and thus has a history of preferring his opinion over facts. That should not cloud the real issue here - labeling a system of thought that is pre-scientific and that does not claim to be based on science ""pseudoscience"" is an expression of opinion, not fact. It may be a popular opinion, it may even be the MOST popular opinion, but that does not make it fact. An opinion should be attributed to those who express it in the body of an article. Alex, I fully welcome your contributions about the ""disjunction between TCM and science"", I have no problem with that line of thinking.

<user_id=Alexbrn>
An appeal to personal experience and more personalization. If the statement is not in serious dispute (i.e. in high-quality sources) then it's a fact we can just assert. Failing to do so would not be neutral.  ||

<user_id=Herbxue>
We've gotten circular at this point, need input from others.

<user_id=Alexbrn>
Looks to me like there's no consensus for your proposed change.  ||

<user_id=Herbxue>
Not yet at least.

<user_id=Mallexikon>
I don't feel comfortable with putting ""pseudoscience"" in the lede, for various reasons.
1.) I think TCM's theoretical base is largely superstitious, but ""pseudoscience"" implies that TCM actually tries to ''sound'' scientific. Which it doesn't. It has used the same terms since 2000 years.
2.) The source we have now is stating nothing else but the opinion of the author of the article, so the source could actually only be used for a sentence like: ""An editorial in ''Nature'' stated that...""
3.) Apart from ""pseudoscience"", TCM has also been labeled ""proto-science"" and ""pre-scientific"" (and probably a couple of other terms as well that didn't show up on my google search).

<user_id=Mallexikon>
My suggestion would be to either to not include all this labeling (and I actually don't understand the necessity for it) or to keep all these sources in a sentence like ""TCM has been labeled pseudoscience, proto-science..."" etc.

<user_id=93.86.155.2>
''Comment''': calling TCL ''fringe'' is beyond ridiculous... Billion+ people in Asia turn to this instead of modern medicine. In fact, one could say modern medicine is fringe for Asians.

<user_id=Mallexikon>
Point taken. However, from a scientific worldview (and that's what we follow on WP), it would still be considered fringe.

<user_id=Mallexikon>
The source says ""proto-scientific system"". If you'd like to claim that that is not covered by WP:Close paraphrasing, I'll be happy to go into WP:DR about this. A third-party opinion might be a good starting point.

<user_id=Herbxue>
Ok, well we have multiple editors agreeing that pseudoscience is not appropriate for the lede so I will abide by WP:CON and remove the whole sentence.

<user_id=178.221.90.250>
Not only pseudoscience label is inappropriate, but talking about TCM in context of fringe and similar guidelines is even more inappropriate. I don't think some editors here understand what fringe means. Even the cited guideline explains something different, read the nutshell if nothing further...

<user_id=Jim1138>
This has been hashed out a number of times before. I would recommend reviewing the archives
Pseudoscience is appropriate. Besides the cite, it fits the wp:duck test. Many claim it to be scientific, yet fails to use scientific methodology. Many mechanisms of effect are not testable or fail testing. The Pseudoscience label should stay. Consensus has not been reached.

<user_id=Herbxue>
Archives yield this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Traditional_Chinese_medicine/Archive_3#Pseudoscience
I would agree consensus has not been reached - either for or against use of the term pseudoscience, and certainly not for the article concluding it is pseudoscience in the lede. I propose a compromise - simply clearly show, in the text of the article, who asserts that it is pseudoscience.

<user_id=QuackGuru>
A summary in the lede for Traditional Chinese medicine#Drug research is appropriate.

",1,"The discussion revolves around whether the term ""pseudoscience"" should be used in the lede of an article about Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) on Wikipedia. The main points of contention are the appropriateness of the term, the neutrality of the article, and the representation of TCM in a scientific context.

1. **Argument for inclusion of ""pseudoscience""**: One side, represented by Alexbrn, argues that TCM is fringe and pseudoscientific, and this should be made clear in the lede according to Wikipedia policy. They cite a Nature opinion piece and argue that the age of the source does not diminish its validity. They also reference Wikipedia's policy on fringe theories and a statement by Wikipedia's co-founder.

2. **Argument against inclusion of ""pseudoscience""**: The other side, represented by Herbxue, argues that the term ""pseudoscience"" is pejorative and that the article should not make a definitive value statement. They suggest that the opinion that TCM is pseudoscience should be attributed to specific sources rather than presented as an uncontested fact. They also point out that TCM does not claim to be based on science and that it is a system of thought that is pre-scientific.

3. **Discussion of neutrality and representation**: Mallexikon raises concerns about the use of the term ""pseudoscience"" and suggests that TCM has been labeled in various ways, including ""proto-science"" and ""pre-scientific."" They propose either avoiding labeling or including all labels with appropriate sources. An anonymous user comments that calling TCM ""fringe"" is inappropriate given its widespread use in Asia.

4. **Consensus and compromise**: Herbxue proposes a compromise to attribute the opinion that TCM is pseudoscience to specific sources within the article. QuackGuru suggests that a summary in the lede for the drug research section of TCM is appropriate.

The quality of the arguments varies. Alexbrn's arguments are based on adherence to Wikipedia policies and the mainstream scientific view of TCM. However, they tend to dismiss opposing views without fully engaging with the nuances of the argument. Herbxue's arguments are focused on the neutrality of the article and the importance of attributing opinions to specific sources, which aligns with Wikipedia's guidelines on verifiability and neutrality. Mallexikon and the anonymous user provide additional perspectives that challenge the framing of TCM as fringe or pseudoscientific.

Overall, the discussion shows a mix of strong adherence to Wikipedia policies, attempts at neutrality, and some instances of dismissiveness and lack of engagement with opposing views. The discussion could benefit from more sources and a more thorough examination of the scientific literature on TCM.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

NPOV: Citing one study for ""numerous empirical studies""

<user_id=Mohawkjohn>
Numerous empirical studies have found that, among other beneficial effects, economic freedom promotes economic growth and poverty reduction. I'm concerned about this line for two reasons. First of all, the subject is ""numerous empirical studies,"" but there's only one citation. Secondly and more importantly, it is non-neutral and overly simplified; it represents a point of view.

<user_id=Vision Thing>
Source (OECD yearbook) says: ""Ongoing work, by those involved in the economic freedom project and outside researchers, shows that economic freedom promotes economic growth and poverty reduction. These findings are now relatively uncontroversial and have been published in leeding peer-reviewed journals, such as the ''American Economic Review''."" Listing number of studies and then saying ""numerous studies say..."" could be classified as original research, this is not. It doesn’t represent a point of view. Studies have really shown that economic freedom promotes economic growth and poverty reduction, that is a matter of fact, not of opinion.

<user_id=Mohawkjohn>
Perhaps you could qualify the statement? Economic freedom MAY promote economic growth and poverty reduction, perhaps. For example, economic freedom for American coffee companies could promote American economic growth and poverty reductionbut what about in Central American countries? It might increase poverty there as well. The point is that it all depends upon how you define/qualify economic freedom. Thus, oversimplification.

<user_id=Doopdoop>
If the general economic freedom increases in the USA, incomes of American consumers increase and they will buy more high quality coffee and so incomes of Central American farmers would increase. Economic freedom for American coffee companies is just too narrow concept, please look at the broader picture.

<user_id=Cretog8>
The OECD yearbook isn't a very good source. It has a ""a series of commentaries from leading figures in policy, business, labour, research and civil society"". The reference in question is in a commentary by FredMcMahon, from the Fraser Institute, who is clearly not a neutral source. And the commentary itself doesn't mention any specific articles, just that studies have been published. I don't doubt it's true, but this source isn't a great one.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. Mohawkjohn raises a concern about the neutrality and simplification of a statement that cites ""numerous empirical studies"" with only one citation. This is a valid point in academic writing and Wikipedia standards, where claims should be supported by multiple sources if they are stated as being widely supported.

2. Vision Thing responds by referencing the OECD yearbook and argues that the findings are uncontroversial and well-published, implying that the single citation is sufficient. However, this argument does not directly address the concern of having only one citation for a claim about ""numerous studies.""

3. Mohawkjohn suggests qualifying the statement to indicate that economic freedom ""may"" promote growth and poverty reduction, highlighting the complexity of the issue and the potential for varying impacts in different contexts. This is a constructive suggestion that aims to improve the neutrality and accuracy of the article.

4. Doopdoop attempts to counter Mohawkjohn's point by presenting a hypothetical scenario where economic freedom in the USA could benefit Central American farmers. This argument is speculative and does not provide evidence or citations, thus it is weaker in terms of academic rigor.

5. Cretog8 points out that the OECD yearbook may not be a neutral or sufficiently rigorous source, as it contains commentaries rather than peer-reviewed studies. This is a strong argument that supports the need for better sourcing and aligns with Wikipedia's standards for reliable sources.

Overall, the discussion includes valid concerns about sourcing, neutrality, and the complexity of the issue at hand. There are attempts to defend the original edit, but these are not always backed by strong evidence or adherence to Wikipedia's standards for neutrality and citation. The participants are engaged in a constructive dialogue, with some arguments being stronger and more aligned with Wikipedia's guidelines than others.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Protected

<user_id=Alex Bakharev>
I have temporarily protected the article, so you could discuss your edit conflict on the talk page, before the edit warring.

<user_id=AmiDaniel>
Thank you for protecting. I really didn't want to get involved in this dispute, but I kept seeing numerous reverts come up while I was on recent changes patrol and initiated a discussion with Xebat. Frankly, I'd say I tend to agree with the anti-Xebat crowd, yet I nonetheless find it inappropriate to repeatedly delete his dispute tags. I really wish everyone would just follow WP:1RR in these cases: Xebat tags the article, the tag is deleted, the tag is restoredleave the tag in place. He honestly has not been given adequate time to explain his complaint, and none of the editors here have shown him any respect or civility. He, on the other hand, was equally uncivil by adding a ridiculous number of inappropriate tags to the article with the intent of undermining its ethical appeal and making a point. As there clearly is a dispute about the factuality and neutrality of the article, I urge the editors here, after the article is unprotected, to leave Xebot's tag in place until a resolution is reachedeither through an overwhelming consensus, his concession, or mediation. It is most definitely inappropriate to repeatedly remove these tags only a couple of hours after they were originally posted. Leave them in place for at least a few days, and if everyone agrees that Xebot has made no valid statement of a dispute, then you can delete them without being rash and cruel.

<user_id=Aucaman>
I think  deserves more credit than he's been given. Some users here try to push for certain terms and ideas to appear in the article not by concensus or cooperation but by carrying out constant revert wars and repeatedly taking off the dispute tags. This has got to stop. The article is on Iranian peoples but the source justifying its definition here comes from an article on Kurds. No sources have been provided that give a consistent definition of who Iranian peoples are and this is of great concern. Instead of looking for comprehensive sources and presenting them here, they have decided to just define things the way they see it and then look for (incomplete) sources justifying one sentence but at the same time contradicting another.

<user_id=SouthernComfort>
Incorrect. There is a consensus and the sources clearly define what is meant by ""Iranian peoples"". Please see WP:V, and as for your other comments directed towards specific editors, please see WP:CIVIL.

<user_id=Khoikhoi>
I agree, users such as Xebat have asked for sources that say that an Iranian ethno-linguistic group exists - we provided it to him and Aucaman but both rejected it saying ""it's about the Kurds"". Yes the subject of the article is about the Kurds, but it still acknowleges the existance of an Iranian ethno-linguistic group.

<user_id=Zereshk>
Is Xebat a sock puppet for ? Just wondering.

<user_id=Aucaman>
Again, just because '''Kurds''' are an ethno-linguistic group it doesn't mean you can call ''Iranians'' an ethno-linguistic group. An ethno-linguistic group is an ethnic group that shares a common language. Kurds have that. ""Iranians"" don't. Iranian is a general linguistic group. I can't believe you're bring this same issue back up. Makes me wonder if you're reading the source correctly.

<user_id=ManiF>
This is what the source says: ""The Kurds, an '''Iranian ethno-linguistic''' group'''like''' Persians, Lurs, Baluch and Bakhtiari"". The source clearly indicates that Iranian peoples (Kurds, Persians, Lurs, Baluch and Bakhtiari) are a related ethnolinguistic group.

<user_id=59.167.12.160>
I am not sure why some people think it is obvious that Iranian Turks are not Iranian peoples!!! Some of us do not think so. So there is no consensus.

<user_id=59.167.12.160>
Therefore, I request protection until we settle this dispute. We need to be clear here. Either we think Iranian peoples is a language based grouping, then fine, merge this article with Iranian languages. Or we think there is more than linguistic link. Then Iranian Turkic people are Iranian peoples.

<user_id=59.167.12.160>
I unprotected the article as I, as a party to dispute, could not protect the article. However, be nice and do not remove my edit until there is a consensus

<user_id=59.167.12.160>
against my above arguments.

<user_id=59.167.12.160>
There has been quite a few editing and deleting going on recently on including Iranian Turkic people. So please do not start an edit warware. It is not fair.

<user_id=59.167.12.160>
When you are respected, try to respect others. Something might be obvious for you, but if you think '''objectively rather than subjectively''', it might not be so.

<user_id=Persian Magi>
I do agree. Azeris and Iranian Turks are as Iranian culturally and ethnically as any Lur, Mazandarani etc.

<user_id=Tombseye>
Okay, again Iranian peoples does not, in the context of this article, mean the country of modern Iran's population as a whole. Iranian peoples refers to people who speak an Iranian language first and foremost and then other factors are discussed. Since the Azeris do not speak an Iranian language they do not qualify as an Iranian or Iranic people. And we've already debated all of these issues ad nauseum. Look up Iranian peoples on the web and you'll find that the Azeris are not included. Their sharing modern Iran or a Persian culture or most aspects is, again, another matter that is discussed in the Azeri people page and on the culture of Iran page. this article is quite specific and the appellation of Iranian peoples is in reference to the various tribes that spoke Iranian languages and their descendents, however putative.

<user_id=203.48.45.194>
Guess our disagreement is in the term ""modern Iran"" and also the title of this article.  Firstly, Azeris and Iranian Turks built Iran as a country together with the rest of Iran. If a thousand years ago is still considered modern time. then you are correct. Please note that Iran has been integrated and disintegrated quite a few times, namely, before and after, Cyrus, Ashkanian, Sasanian, Samanian, Ghaznavian, Kharazmian, Safavian (500 years ago) , Afshar, Zand, Qajar. You can see how many times of those were Turks. At least from Safavids on, they were not considered other people than Iranians. (Do you think Shah Ismail or Nader Shah was a non-Iranian at his time?).

<user_id=203.48.45.194>
Secondly, If you are talking linguistics here, then the title of the article is misleading and inappropriate and the article should merge with Iranian languages. Iranian peoples are Iranian '''peoples''' and not ""speakers of Iranian languages"".

<user_id=Tombseye>
The term Iranian is used by academics to denote a group of people as well its modern usage as applied to the people of modern Iran. Terminology changes over millenia and called many names, often those of ruling dynasties. As noted at the top of the article, Iranian peoples is not about the Iranian demographics or Iran itself, but simply parts of its population who speak Iranian languages. I'm talking about the ancient movements of the Iranic peoples as well as their languages, some commonalities and differences and the most common accepted definition that does not include Turkic speaking peoples. I think the only way to resolve this is a vote to see if people think inclusion of Turkic peoples is warranted or not.

<user_id=Persian Magi>
Please clarify who ""acadmeics"" are. I am guessing you are not refering to internet pages with subjective contents but rather refering to University text books and known scholars using the term exactly the same and for the same meaning.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Alex Bakharev** - The user has taken an administrative action to protect the article and encourages discussion on the talk page. This is a procedural comment rather than an argument about the content, so it doesn't contribute to the quality of the discussion regarding the edit itself.

2. **AmiDaniel** - The user is advocating for a more civil and structured approach to resolving the dispute, suggesting adherence to Wikipedia's one-revert rule (WP:1RR) and giving time for the dispute to be explained. This is a reasonable approach that encourages a fair discussion and resolution process.

3. **Aucaman** - The user raises concerns about the sourcing and definition of ""Iranian peoples"" and criticizes the approach of some editors. The argument is somewhat valid in that it calls for better sources and a clearer definition, but it lacks specific examples or suggestions for improvement.

4. **SouthernComfort** - The user asserts that there is a consensus and that sources clearly define ""Iranian peoples,"" but does not provide evidence or elaborate on the consensus. This is a weak argument as it does not substantiate the claim.

5. **Khoikhoi** - The user agrees with the previous point and mentions that sources have been provided, but again, no specific sources are cited in the comment. The argument is weak due to the lack of evidence.

6. **Zereshk** - The user speculates about another user being a sock puppet, which is an accusation rather than an argument related to the content dispute. This does not contribute to the quality of the discussion.

7. **ManiF** - The user provides a direct quote from a source that supports the idea of Iranian peoples being an ethno-linguistic group. This is a strong argument as it uses evidence to support the claim.

8. **59.167.12.160** - The user presents a series of arguments about the inclusion of Iranian Turks as Iranian peoples, questioning the consensus and the basis for the grouping (linguistic or cultural). The arguments are relevant and raise important points for consideration, although they could be strengthened with more evidence.

9. **Persian Magi** - The user expresses agreement with the inclusion of Azeris and Iranian Turks as Iranian peoples, citing cultural and ethnic reasons. This is a relevant argument but lacks detailed evidence or sources.

10. **Tombseye** - The user clarifies the scope of the term ""Iranian peoples"" as used in the article and distinguishes it from the population of modern Iran. The argument is clear and relevant, explaining the academic usage of the term, but could be improved with specific academic references.

11. **203.48.45.194** - The user challenges the linguistic basis for defining Iranian peoples and suggests that the title of the article is misleading if it does not include Turkic peoples. The argument is relevant and raises a valid point about the potential confusion caused by the title.

Overall, the discussion includes a mix of strong arguments with evidence, reasonable suggestions for process and civility, and weaker claims without substantiation. There are also irrelevant comments and accusations that do not contribute to the quality of the discussion. The discussion could be improved with more specific evidence, clearer definitions, and a focus on the content rather than on the users involved.

Endorsement of the potential issuance of a trillion dollar coin

<user_id=Deicas>
, in revision en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Krugman&oldid;=532290410, removed my addition of Dr. Krugman's endorsement of the potential issuance of a  trillion dollar platinum coin giving, as a reason ""oh for chrissake, he is too joking. He's using a joke to make a serious point. A point which has nothing to do with the existence of a trill $ coin but with the stupidity of the current budget process.""
Krugman's *not* joking.  On 7 January 2012 he wrote:
Should President Obama be willing to print a $1 trillion platinum coin if Republicans try to force America into default? Yes, absolutely. He will, after all, be faced with a choice between two alternatives: one that’s silly but benign, the other that’s equally silly but both vile and disastrous. The decision should be obvious. ...					False
1	2013-01-10 05:01:42	Deicas	Enter the platinum coin. There’s a legal loophole allowing the Treasury to mint platinum coins in any denomination the secretary chooses. Yes, it was intended to allow commemorative collector’s items — but that’s not what the letter of the law says. And by minting a $1 trillion coin, then depositing it at the Fed, the Treasury could acquire enough cash to sidestep the debt ceiling — while doing no economic harm at all.
Then, on 8 January he wrote ""Joe Weisenthal says that the coin debate is the most important fiscal policy debate of our lifetimes; I agree, with two slight quibbles — it’s arguably more of a monetary than a fiscal debate, and it’s really part of the broader debate that has been going on ever since we entered the liquidity trap.""
If there is any joking in the coin issuance suggestion I can't find it.  If , or anyone else, is going to remove this edit claiming ""joking"" would they be so kind as to quote, from the cited columns, text that supports the ""joking"" claim.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
To repeat: he's using a joke to make a serious point. Which you are completely missing.

<user_id=Deicas>
You make the assertion ""To repeat: he's using a joke to make a serious point"" but unresponsively fail to include any supporting information.  Per my request, above, ""... be so kind as to quote, from the cited columns, text that supports the 'joking' claim"".

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
Ok, look, Krugman is using the whole trillion dollar coin example as a way of explaining why the current way that fiscal policy is conducted is absurd. Specifically, the fact that: ''""we have the weird and destructive institution of the debt ceiling; this lets Congress approve tax and spending bills that imply a large budget deficit — tax and spending bills the president is legally required to implement — and then lets Congress refuse to grant the president authority to borrow, preventing him from carrying out his legal duties and provoking a possibly catastrophic default.""''. That's the whole point of the column. The coin is just a way of illustrating that. If the administration could just ignore the ridiculous debt ceiling threat then the idea of the coin would be moot. You're focusing on HOW the argument is presented, rather than WHAT the argument actually is. And this isn't about ""supporting the claim"", it's about simple reading comprehension.
More generally, the fact is that Krugman makes lots of points in a lot of columns. Should we include every single one in the article? Obviously not. If this coin idea gets implemented or something then yeah, sure, this particular column or two may be notable for inclusion. But right now it's just non-notable recentism (which usually, on Wikipedia turns into an oxymoronic phenomenon of outdated recentism) as this just happens to be something being discussed in the blogosphere at the moment. Just because it's in print somewhere does not mean it needs to be included. And especially it does not need to be included in a way which obfuscates and misses the main point.

<user_id=Deicas>
Do I understand correctly that you are withdrawing the joking"" claim?  Please clarify.
I am not clear whether you are saying that Dr. Krugman's policy recommendation that the US Treasury should be ""minting a $1 trillion coin"" is inappropriate for inclusion in  Paul_Krugman#U.S._economic_policies.  If you are making that claim, then please specifically state same and describe the criteria that you are using to make that judgement.
I am not clear whether you are saying that the edit in question does not adequately  describe the policy issue in question cf. ""which obfuscates and misses the main point"".  If you are making that claim, then please specifically state same and perhaps you would be so kind as to extend the edit in question to address your concern.  Does this extended description belong in Paul Krugman or Trillion_Dollar_Coin?
I am not aware that ""recentism"" is an accepted reason for edit reversion.  If you claim ""recentism"" as a reversion, then would you please cite the Wikipedia policy that describes ""recentism"".

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
I have explained myself sufficiently.

<user_id=Mangoe>
It's quite obvious that Krugman thinks that the coin is a stupid idea and that he's ridiculing other Republican policies as being even stupider. If this isn't the message you're getting from the articles, then perhaps you should consider stepping away from this topic.

<user_id=Arzel>
What is obvious to one, is not neccessarily obvious to another.  Krugman called the coin idea a gimmick, but he also called any gimmick to get around the budget ceiling a good idea.  I suppose you prefer to call Krugman's support of this gimmick to be a joke, because otherwise Krugman is just as stupid as the Republicans you are critical of.

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
Generally it's not a good idea to suppose stuff you have no basis for supposin'. Let's call it a ""serious joke"", ey?

<user_id=Deicas>
I made the assertion, above, that ""Krugman's *not* joking"".  I supported that assertion with two quotes from two different Krugman columns.

<user_id=Deicas>
I further support ""Krugman's *not* joking"" with this item, from a law professor, who believes Krugman's proposal is serious: http://althouse.blogspot.com/2013/01/hope-and-change-into-clown-costume.html.

<user_id=Deicas>
If someone wants to claim that Krugman's joking, the burden is on them to: 1) find a suitable citation that references Krugman's Trillion_dollar_coin proposal enforcement; 2) says that Krugman's joking and; 3) insert into the edit under dispute something to the effect that ""... but some say Krugman's endorment is only joking"".

<user_id=Deicas>
I ask the questions, above, that you decline to answer, so that I can *clearly* understand your proposed solution (eg. put extended description in Trillion_Dollar_Coin, or, never cite the referenced Krugman columns in Paul Krugman ) and the reasoning for same.

<user_id=Deicas>
I went to the trouble of asking the questions.  I ask that you go to the trouble of answering the each or, alternatively, explain why the question is not dispositive for the issue at hand.

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
Again, this isn't a matter of sourcing but a simple matter of reading comprehension. Pay attention to the part where he says ''He will, after all, be faced with a choice between two alternatives: one that’s silly but benign, the other that’s equally silly but both vile and disastrous'' though. And please stop trying to waste our time.

<user_id=Deicas>
So Krugman observes that there is a bad solution (""silly but benign"") and a worse solution (""equally silly but both vile and disastrous"")?  So?  Politics & economics are *filled* with situations where the best solution is only least bad.  How does that support your undo-ing of the edit under dispute because ""... he is too joking ...""?

This is about as ridiculous as me demanding that you present a source to the effect that ""Krugman is NOT joking when he endorses the trillion dollar coin"".  dammit! So. Go out there and find that, then come back here and play the passive-aggressive-recent-account-but-well-versed-in-Wikipedia-policy shtick and maybe I'll be willing to waste my time on being trolled.

They support their claim with direct quotes from Krugman's columns, which suggest that Krugman is indeed considering the idea as a legitimate, albeit unusual, solution to a fiscal problem.

2. **<user_id=Volunteer Marek>** counters by saying that Krugman is using the coin as a rhetorical device to illustrate the absurdity of the current fiscal policy process. They argue that the focus should be on the broader point Krugman is making about fiscal policy rather than the specific example of the coin. However, they do not provide direct evidence from Krugman's work to support the claim that it's a joke.

3. **<user_id=Mangoe>** and **<user_id=Arzel>** provide their interpretations of Krugman's stance, with Mangoe suggesting that Krugman is ridiculing Republican policies and Arzel pointing out that Krugman has called the coin idea a gimmick but still supports it as a solution.

4. **<user_id=Deicas>** continues to defend their position by providing additional sources that interpret Krugman's proposal as serious. They also request specific evidence to support the claim that Krugman is joking, which has not been provided by the other users.

5. **<user_id=Volunteer Marek>** maintains their stance but does not provide the requested evidence to support the claim that Krugman's endorsement is a joke. They also suggest that the discussion is a waste of time, which could be seen as an attempt to dismiss the argument without adequately addressing it.

6. **<user_id=Deicas>** persists in asking for clarification and evidence, demonstrating a willingness to engage in a detailed discussion to reach a clear understanding.

The overall quality of the discussion is mixed. On one hand, <user_id=Deicas> provides a structured argument with evidence and seeks clarification when counterarguments are made. On the other hand, <user_id=Volunteer Marek> and others provide counterarguments but do not support them with the same level of detail or evidence, and at times, the discussion veers towards dismissiveness rather than constructive debate.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

<user_id=George>
Per WP:NONENG, could I request that someone provide the text of the relevant pages from ''Keneged Kol HaSikuim'' in Hebrew, a work the article currently cites? Please also provide an English translation of the relevant pages. Thanks! ←

Does the article use direct quotes? ''''

Don't think so. ←

If you have a live link I might be willing to quote it. In general though, if the source is legit and the text is not a direct quote, then there shouldn't be a problem leaving it as is. Off course, an English replacement would be preferable. What's the content about anyways? ''''

<user_id=George>
It's an offline source. I think Shuki added it as a reference, so hopefully they have access to it, or know where to find it. It doesn't really matter if the source is being used for a direct quote or not (per WP:NONENG, ""When citing such a source without quoting it, the original and its translation should be provided if requested by other editors: this can be added to a footnote or the talk page.""). I don't really care what language it is in, so long as a translation I can understand is provided. It's being cited for quite a few things - more than any other source currently in the article. The statements in which it is currently the only source being cited are:
[The name Psagot] expresses the hope that the new village will achieve a peak in settlement and study of the Torah.
In 1981, Ariel Sharon, then Israeli Minister of Defense, told Pinchas Wallerstein, head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, that he would support initiatives to settle the area.
After the first families moved to the site, the Supreme Court of Israel ordered a freeze on further settlement activity in the wake of an Arab property claim that was later rejected. In the spring of 1982, fifteen trailer homes were brought to the site and building plans for 48 houses were approved by the Minister of Housing and Construction David Levy. ←  

<user_id=Shuki>
The first two I recall are translations of short lines anyway, the last one is actually a summary of a few paragraphs.

<user_id=George>
I don't think it's necessary to provide the full pages in Hebrew and translate them (which could be a copyright violation), but if you can provide the Hebrew & English of those relevant sentences/paragraphs, that would be great. ←  

<user_id=George>
Might also want to include the sentences/paragraphs that support the ""Israeli Supreme Court confirms this"" phrasing. I know it's been removed from the article, but I suspect it's something that editors are going to edit war over for a while. Cheers. ←  

<user_id=Shuki>
Thanks for mentioning that. I think it's quite important to mention a freeze and eventual unfreeze outcome to that in the same paragraph. Removing it leaves the reader in suspense.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Request for Source and Translation: George initiates the discussion by requesting the Hebrew text and an English translation of specific pages from a book cited in an article. This is a reasonable request per Wikipedia's policy on non-English sources, which states that translations should be provided if requested by other editors.

2. Clarification on Direct Quotes: Jaakobou asks if the article uses direct quotes, which is relevant because direct quotes would necessitate a more precise translation. George clarifies that direct quotes are not used, but the policy still requires a translation.

3. Content Inquiry: Jaakobou inquires about the content and the necessity of an English replacement, which is a valid point for understanding the context and importance of the source material.

4. Detailed Request: George provides specific statements from the article that are sourced from the book, which helps in identifying the exact content that needs to be translated.

5. Provision of Hebrew Text: Shuki provides some lines in Hebrew but does not provide a translation. This partially fulfills the request but leaves the non-Hebrew speaking editors without the ability to verify the content.

6. Request for Necessary Support: George asks for the necessary text to support the statements in the article, which is a fair request to ensure that the source is being used accurately.

7. Refusal to Provide Full Translation: Shuki expresses concern about potential copyright violations if the whole section is transcribed and translated. This is a valid concern; however, it does not address the request for specific sentences or paragraphs.

8. Repeated Request and Threat of Removal: Nableezy repeats the request for quotations and translations and threatens to remove the material if not provided. This is a strong stance but aligns with Wikipedia's verification policy.

9. Attempt to Contact Author: Shuki mentions efforts to contact the author for permission or to find out if an English translation is planned. This shows an attempt to resolve the issue but does not provide the immediate solution requested.

10. Accusation and Defense: The discussion devolves into accusations of lying and refusal to cooperate, which detracts from the constructive resolution of the issue.

Overall, the discussion starts with a reasonable request and attempts to clarify the requirements for translation. However, it becomes less productive as it progresses, with some participants focusing on procedural issues and others on potential copyright violations. The argument quality is mixed, with some valid points raised about policy and copyright, but the discussion is marred by a lack of cooperation and escalating tension.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5
"<user_id=Muntuwandi>
NPOV

<user_id=Muntuwandi>
On one hand this incident is quite minor. My first impression is that this incident does not have the enduring notability necessary for it to have a long term future on Wikipedia. I sincerely doubt that in five or ten years time there will be much discussion concerning this controversy. It is possible that it could grow legs and start to run. If there is some scandalous email or recorded phone conversation from the DOJ, anything could happen. But barring such a revelation, I don't see this incident having long term notability, similar to WP:NOTNEWS.
I consider the tone of this article not neutral and have added the NPOV tag. Captain Occam has attempted to preemptively address neutrality problems by including some criticisms of how some conservatives have handled the case. The New Black Panther Party is a fringe group that has made a series of highly controversial and divisive statements in its history. But I do think that in this article, the NBPP has been set up as a punching bag, a sort of strawman.

<user_id=Captain Occam>
Whether or not this case is notable enough to deserve its own article was discussed here and here, and every editor who expressed an opinion about this agreed with me that it was.  That was in July.  If anything, the case’s notability has only grown since then, since that was before Christopher Coates offered his testimony about this case as well as before the DOJ’s inspector general began his investigation about it.
If anyone else thinks this case isn’t notable, then they can start an AFD about the article, but I don’t think there’s much question what the outcome of any such AFD would be.  This topic has about the same level of notability as the Resignation of Shirley Sherrod, which was nominated for deletion in July.  The deletion discussion about that article lasted barely a day, before being closed early as “keep” per WP:SNOW.  I think we can expect any AFD about this article to have a similar result.

<user_id=Captain Occam>
Something you need to keep in mind about this article is that the case it covers has received more coverage from conservative news sources than from liberal ones, and both conservative and liberal news sources have pointed this out.  NPOV policy requires articles here to contain the same proportion of perspectives that exists in reliable sources, so in order for the article to comply with NPOV policy, that proportion of conservative and liberal viewpoints needs to be reflected in the article.  According to WP:TAGGING, any tag for an article should be accompanied by an explanation of what’s wrong with the article, and if none is provided it’s appropriate to remove the tag.  All you’ve said about your reason for tagging the article is “I consider the tone of this article not neutral”, which does not tell me anything about what specific parts of the article you think are biased, or even in which direction you think they’re biased.  (I suspect that you think the article has a conservative bias, but you haven’t even made that clear.)  Therefore, I am going to remove the tag until someone can explain more specifically what NPOV problems there are with this article, in a way that would make it possible for them to be fixed.

<user_id=Muntuwandi>
You have given a blow by blow account of the controversy, mostly from a conservative perspective. However this blow by blow dramatic account tends to give undue weight to the controversy. You have used several quotes but most of your quotes have been cherry picked from conservative sources, and there is much less criticism of conservatives. The article assumes that the incident is very important, whereas most mainstream outlets have not considered the story as one of their top priorities. In short, in this article,  the NBPP is the punching bag, and the justice department was wrong to dismiss the case. This is why I believe the article isn't neutral

<user_id=Captain Occam>
“most mainstream outlets have not considered the story as one of their top priorities”
That’s simply false.  I recommend that you take a look at the  I’ve assembled in my userspace to get an idea of the mainstream news coverage this case has received.  So far there have been six articles about this case from the Washington Post, five from the Associated Press, four from CNN, and so on.  This case would be notable even if were to completely ignore the coverage it’s received from conservative sources.  (Not that we should, since that would be a blatant NPOV violation.)
I also don’t see how it’s possible for the article to “give undue weight to the controversy” over this case.  The article is ''about'' the controversy over this case, because the controversy over it is what every one of the news articles about it is discussing.  How is it possible for an article to give undue weight to its entire subject matter?

<user_id=Captain Occam>
And you aren’t acknowledging my point about the article needing to accurately reflect the balance of viewpoints that exists in the source literature about this case, which are more conservative than liberal.  Until you address this point, and provide specific examples of things that you think ought to be changed about this article, there’s nothing for us to discuss here.

<user_id=Muntuwandi>
I didn't say that mainstream outlets haven't covered the story, only that it is not a top priority for them. There are not enough arguments from mainstream outlets that suggest that this incident is ""very small potatoes"". Sure there is a section on media coverage, but there isn't enough information about how this story is actually being hyped up and driven by conservative outlets. In my opinion, this is more of a story about a story. The actual incident is close to being irrelevant. The fallout is more seemingly more important than the actual events. I think these news items give a better representation of the media coverage and the controversy as a whole.

<user_id=Captain Occam>
Since articles at Politico are not checked for accuracy by an editorial board, I don’t think articles there satisfy WP:RS.  However, there is already an entire section devoted to the main subject of the Politico article you linked to, which is Abigail Thernstrom’s criticism of the investigation about this case.  And the NPR article that you linked to is already cited here.
NPOV policy requires that each aspect of this case be given about the same amount of space in the Wikipedia article that it’s given in reliable sources discussing the case.  Of the 100 or so news articles that I’ve found about this case in reliable sources, there are around eight that focus on the media coverage it’s getting.  In other words, around 8% of the source material about this case is discussing the media coverage it’s received, with the other 92% of the source material being about various aspects of the case itself.  Therefore, in order to comply with NPOV policy, discussion about this case’s media coverage should take up around 8% of the article.  That’s pretty close to the amount of space that it currently has.

<user_id=Muntuwandi>
I got the NPR item from the article, but a lot of the information from the source isn't included in the article. Such percentages are unscientific and misleading, especially given how a single news item can be duplicated in an infinite number of ways over the internet. In time I will proceed to make some adjustments to bring some neutrality to the article, I will use sources such as those mentioned above.

<user_id=Muntuwandi>
The article has major NPOV issues that I will start address in the coming days. The article could also do with some trimming because sometimes less is more.

<user_id=Captain Occam>
If you actually are intending to try and improve the article, I hope it’s going to involve more than just blanking large sections of content.  There may well be parts of the article that could be worded in a more neutral or more concise manner, but I don’t think there are any entire sections or paragraphs that it would be reasonable to just delete, the way you’ve often done on race and intelligence articles.  Your other method of trying to improve articles, by reverting them back several months to an earlier version you liked better, also isn’t going to work in this case because the article doesn’t have an earlier version to revert it to.  (Unless you intend to turn it back into a redirect, which is completely inappropriate for a topic with this level of notability.)
I’d also suggest that you seek consensus for any major changes you’re intending to make.

<user_id=Captain Occam>
Some of the changes you’ve made to this article appear to be worthwhile, so I’m not going to do a blanket revert, but it would have been better if you’d discussed them here first.  There are definitely some changes you’ve made that I don’t approve of, such as sourced content that you’ve blanked without any explanation why, and unsourced statements that you've added about living people.

<user_id=Muntuwandi>
Initially I didn't do a thorough job of sourcing. I have added the sources that were missing, so all the material should be backed up. I can provide clarification if needed. To go over a few points
The criminal investigation was dropped by the Bush administration, not the Obama administration.
According to Perez's testimony
'Whereas, the original complaint sought an unlimited injunction prohibiting acts of intimidation anywhere in the United States, the final relief sought by the Department was limited solely to the City of Philadelphia and was only to last through November of 2012''
So I have added this text to explain what exactly the reduction in scope entailed.
As for the Reactions in Congress vs Republicans in congress, I just wanted to point out that it is not a bipartisan concern, rather it is a few republican congress people who are driving the issue.
According to Adam's testimony
MR. BLACKWOOD:  Was there any indication that anyone higher up than Loretta King or Steve Rosenbaum was making the decision to override the six career attorneys who said the case should go forward?
MR. ADAMS:  None that I had any indication of.
This is still a Bush administration controversy, because it started prior to the Obama administration, and is also related to the Noxubee- Ike Brown case.

<user_id=Muntuwandi>
I have just added some information that states that the individuals who decided to dismiss the case against the NBPP, King and Rosenbaum, had served in the justice dept under both Bushes and several other presidents. They were temporarily ""promoted"" to acting AAG under the Obama administration, but they were still DOJ insiders. This may help clear up what actually happened. One could easily get the impression that the decision to dismiss the case came directly from the White House. While not impossible, the evidence seems to suggest that a lot of the deliberation was internal to the DOJ and that disputes over how to handle such incidents commenced in the Bush administration, and not the Obama administration.

<user_id=Captain Occam>
I don’t have a problem with including this information, but we also need to make it clear that what’s currently being reported by reliable secondary sources is that political appointees may have been heavily involved in the decision to drop the case, and that the DOJ has tried to conceal their involvement.  An example of an article pointing this out out is this article in the Washington Post, which is a fairly mainstream and non-partisan news channel.

<user_id=Muntuwandi>
One issue is the characterization of political appointees. Usually we think of a political appointee as someone who comes from outside the department to enforce the governing administration's policies. In this case the political appointees who made the decision to dismiss, King and Rosenbaum, were not from outside, but were veterans of the DOJ. Conservative critics would like to give the impression that their decision to dismiss came from higher up, that is from the AG or the White House. This is not impossible, but it also seems likely that their decision may have been influenced by baggage from their long careers in the department, rather than any direct influence from higher ups. According to Adam's testimony, there was already tension in the DOJ about how to handle racial issues long before the Obama administration took office. The DOJ was also under a lot of pressure from civil rights groups when it came to pursuing cases against minorities. Blaming the Obama administration for what is partly a pre-existing dispute seems to be a bit of an exaggeration. This is why a number of sources have described the controversy as phony, faux or as a manufactured scandal.

<user_id=Muntuwandi>
As for the Washington Post article, it doesn't give the whole story. The draft report that states that political appointees were involved in the decision to dismiss was created by the conservative dominated US Civil Rights Commission. It is the report that the democratic commissioner Michael Yaki, walked out on in order to prevent a vote when he described the commission as a Kangaroo court. The draft report was leaked to TPMMuckraker, so it is not officially out.

<user_id=Captain Occam>
It looks like I initially cited the wrong article in this paragraph.  I’ve fixed the ref now, and clarified which political appointees are suspected to have been involved in the decision.

<user_id=Captain Occam>
Something you need to realize about this article (and all Wikipedia articles, for that matter) is that the perspectives we present in it can only be the perspectives that exist in reliable secondary sources.  You’ve added a lot of information to this article that’s cited to primary sources, such as unedited transcripts of testimony before the Civil Rights Commission.  That isn’t in itself a problem, but it isn’t appropriate for you to use your understanding of the case from these kinds of sources as a basis for disputing what the ''Washington Post'' is reporting about it.  If the ''Washington Post'' doesn’t give the whole story, and neither do any other reliable secondary sources, then Wikipedia can only give as much of the story as what these sources are reporting.  That’s just how Wikipedia works.

<user_id=Muntuwandi>
The CNN article gives a more accurate account, than the Washington Post. The CNN article is a reliable secondary source, so I believe it should supersede the Washington Post article. The title ""possible involvement of political appointees"" reads like a leading question and would appear to violate NPOV. Some claim that political appointees were not involved and some claim that they were involved. Therefore it is appropriate for neutrality to take neither side. I can't find much on Hans Spakovsky, it seems the only articles that have published anything are Foxnews and The National Review.

<user_id=Captain Occam>
As I said, Wikipedia can only present information that’s published in reliable sources.  So if National Review and Fox News are the only sources that talk about Spakovsky, then that’s all we can present about him here.  (I think it’s better to cite National Review than Fox News, since there seems to be some dispute over how reliable Fox News is.)
The CNN article that you linked to is already cited here, for the part of the article which talks about Yaki walking out of the commission meeting.  This article doesn’t discuss the question of the extent that political appointees were involved in the decision to dismiss the case, so I don’t see how it’s possible for it to supersede what the Washington Post is reporting about that.  I understand your point that the draft is what Yaki walked out of the meeting in order to prevent a vote about, but unless a reliable source is disputing what the Washington Post has reported about political involvement ''specifically for this reason'', for Wikipedia to use Yaki’s reaction as a basis to dispute this would be an example of WP:SYNTH.  Remember, we can’t present any conclusions here that don’t exist in the source material.

<user_id=Muntuwandi>
What I meant was that the Washington Post does not explicitly mention that the draft report was leaked to TPMMuckraker as the CNN article does. The Washington Post does not mention that the leaked report was not the final draft. The CNN articles states
'Reynolds confirmed the draft document is authentic, but said it is not the most recent summary that the commission would have voted on Friday had there been a quorum. He declined to immediately release the newest version, and would not describe what revisions may have been made.''
You write
'The Washington Post reported that according to a draft report from the Civil Rights Commission, political officials had been extensively involved in the decision to dismiss the case, and that the Department of Justice had attempted to conceal their involvement.''
But this statement is out of context and even obsolete because the draft that the Washington Post is referring to is not the final draft, is not official but a leaked version and has not even been voted on by the commission. This was why I mentioned that the CNN article supersedes the Washington Post because it has these extra details.

<user_id=Captain Occam>
As you might have noticed, I’ve added some of the additional details from the CNN article to clarify that the leaked draft wasn’t the final version.  However, I think for this part of the article to discuss Yaki walking out of the meeting would be getting too close to WP:SYNTH.  The CNN article discusses Yaki’s reaction without discussing the report’s accusations of political interference, and the Washington Post article discusses the report’s accusations about this but not Yaki’s reaction, so for us to bring up Yaki’s reaction in order to dispute what the report says about this is making a point that doesn’t exist in the source material.  I think Yaki’s walking out of the meeting should be discussed later in the “Civil Rights Commission” section, where it currently is.

<user_id=Muntuwandi>
I am not particular about the details. The main point is that the accusations from the USCCR are not official yet. When they draft is voted on and the final report is officially made public, not just leaked, then the USCCR would have declared its position. It wouldn't be inappropriate to report speculative or unofficial claims that appear in reliable secondary sources, but these claims should be placed in their proper context.

",0,"The discussion between Muntuwandi and Captain Occam revolves around the neutrality and notability of a Wikipedia article concerning a controversial incident. Both parties present arguments related to Wikipedia's policies on notability (WP:NOTABLE), neutral point of view (NPOV), and the use of reliable sources (WP:RS).

Muntuwandi's main arguments are:
1. The incident may not have enduring notability and could be seen as WP:NOTNEWS.
2. The article has a conservative bias and gives undue weight to the controversy.
3. The article does not adequately represent the perspective that the incident is being hyped by conservative outlets.
4. The decision to dismiss the case against the NBPP was made by DOJ veterans, not directly by the Obama administration, which should be clarified to avoid misleading readers.

Captain Occam's main arguments are:
1. The incident has grown in notability, as evidenced by the ongoing investigations and media coverage.
2. The proportion of conservative and liberal viewpoints in the article should reflect that of the reliable sources covering the incident.
3. Wikipedia articles must reflect the perspectives present in reliable secondary sources, and primary sources should not be used to dispute secondary source reporting.
4. The involvement of political appointees in the decision to dismiss the case is reported by reliable sources and should be included in the article.

Both participants provide evidence to support their claims, such as citing media coverage and official testimonies. They also engage in a back-and-forth about the interpretation of Wikipedia's policies and how they apply to the article in question.

Muntuwandi's arguments are focused on ensuring that the article does not lean towards a particular political bias and that it accurately reflects the level of importance mainstream media places on the incident. Captain Occam emphasizes the importance of adhering to what is reported in reliable sources and maintaining the balance of perspectives as they are presented in those sources.

The discussion is civil, and both parties make efforts to substantiate their points with references to Wikipedia policies and external sources. They also show a willingness to compromise and consider each other's edits, although there is some disagreement on the interpretation of sources and policies.

Overall, the discussion is of high quality. It demonstrates a good understanding of Wikipedia's guidelines, a commitment to maintaining the integrity of the article, and a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue. Both parties make valid points and show a level of sophistication in their argumentation.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.",8.0

Antioxidant effect of polyphenols and natural phenols

<user_id=Tonyhammond>
The article section on product and research goes to great pains to make it sound like the polyphenols in Monavie have no benefit in vivo.  This is in direct contradiction to Wikipedia's own article titled ""Antioxidant effect of polyphenols and natural phenols""  where the anti-inflammatory benefits of polyphenols and other benefits in vivo are reported.  Recommend removing that entire paragraph until a more appropriate and scientifically accurate discussion can take its place.

<user_id=Tonyhammond>
Here is direct quote from Wikipedia article ""Antioxidant effect of polyphenols and natural phenols."" Consuming dietary polyphenols may be associated with effects in higher animal species:
- Possible reduction in inflammation such as in coronary artery disease[6][7] including specific research on endothelial cells via downregulation of oxidative LDL.[8]
- Other possible effects may result from consumption of foods rich in polyphenols, but are not yet proved scientifically in humans so are not allowed as health statements by regulatory authorities like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Among these are possible anti-aging effects in skin.[9] Further research may discern if polyphenol antioxidants have biological roles in vivo.[10][11]
Could substitute above paragraph for the paragraph on polyphenols in the Monavie article.

<user_id=AndyTheGrump>
No. We are not going to violate WP:MEDRS to help you push your overpriced fruit juice with weasel-worded nonsense. 'Not scientifically proven' means exactly what it says. As for 'further research', this would be a lot easier if companies like MonaVie told their customers just how much 'antioxidant' there actually was in the product. And BTW, we don't cite our own articles as sources - though if we did, your cherry-picked interpretation of the article wouldn't be acceptable anyway. It quite specifically states that ""caution should be exercised in attempting diets depending largely on dietary supplements as opposed to a broad array of food sources, since the quality and concentrations of beneficial chemicals in some commercial products is subject to question"".

<user_id=Tonyhammond>
Did not and would not suggest violating any reliable source criteria. Further, am not suggesting you use one Wiki article to support another.  However, the sources cited in that article are just as valid for the Monavie article if addressing polyphenols.  My point is that the current Monavie article is highly biased in a negative way and the other article is more balanced and more accuratepresenting both sides of the issue.  The sources cited in the polyphenol article are more credible and there is a preponderance of scientific evidence now available to suggest that the Monavie article is erroneous, biased, and violates Wikipedia's criteria that articles be balanced, unbiased and not push someone's personal agenda.  It seems like someone here is pushing an anti-MonaVie agenda rather than one of presenting a balanced, unbiased view.  If you can't support presenting a balanced, unbiased view, then I recommend dropping the paragraph entirely.

<user_id=AndyTheGrump>
The sources cited in the polyphenol article are not about MonaVie. It would violate WP:MEDRS (and common sense) to suggest that they were. We don't lie to our readers to suit the wishes of promoters of dubious 'multi-level marketing' schemes. If you can't stop pushing a pro-MonaVie agenda, I suggest you do it somewhere other than Wikipedia.

Not pushing a pro-MonaVie agenda, but I am disconcerted with the anti-Monavie agenda that you and others seem to be promoting.  I am just trying to understand why it is okay to malign a product with articles that do not refer to the product but instead refer to components of the product, but it is not okay to refute those erroneous statements with more recent scientific evidence.  Is Wikipedia about presenting the truth or your agenda?  As early as 2005 the Journal of Clinical Nutrition was reporting on the benefits of and anti-inflamatory properties of polyphenols...here is one article from 2005 other, more recent articles abound...Polyphenols: antioxidants and beyond,Augustin Scalbert, et al, an excerpt from the abstract is below:
Research on the effects of dietary polyphenols on human health has developed considerably in the past 10 y. It strongly supports a role for polyphenols in the prevention of degenerative diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and cancers. The antioxidant properties of polyphenols have been widely studied, but it has become clear that the mechanisms of action of polyphenols go beyond the modulation of oxidative stress....it seems to me the outdated references in the article should be replaced with more recent scientific evidence.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Tonyhammond is arguing that the Monavie article on Wikipedia should reflect the potential benefits of polyphenols as suggested by other scientific literature and Wikipedia's own article on ""Antioxidant effect of polyphenols and natural phenols."" This user is suggesting that the current Monavie article is biased and not presenting a balanced view of the scientific evidence regarding polyphenols.

2. User AndyTheGrump counters by emphasizing adherence to Wikipedia's medical reliable source guidelines (WP:MEDRS), which require high-quality sources for health-related content. This user is concerned about the potential promotion of Monavie, which is described as an ""overpriced fruit juice,"" and is wary of making claims that are not scientifically proven or that could mislead readers.

3. User Tonyhammond responds by clarifying that they are not suggesting using one Wikipedia article to support another, but rather that the sources cited within the polyphenol article could be relevant to the Monavie article when discussing polyphenols. The user is advocating for a balanced presentation of information and is concerned that the current Monavie article may be pushing an anti-Monavie agenda.

4. User AndyTheGrump maintains that the sources in the polyphenol article are not specifically about Monavie and that it would be inappropriate to apply them directly to the Monavie article. This user is focused on ensuring that Wikipedia does not inadvertently endorse or promote products, especially within the context of multi-level marketing schemes.

5. An unsigned comment (presumably from Tonyhammond or a supporter) brings up a specific scientific article from the Journal of Clinical Nutrition to support the argument that polyphenols have recognized health benefits. This comment suggests that the Monavie article should be updated with more recent scientific evidence.

Evaluation:

- User Tonyhammond presents a reasonable argument for updating the Monavie article to reflect current scientific understanding of polyphenols. However, the user's argument lacks specificity on how the Monavie product itself has been studied in relation to these benefits, which is crucial for the article's accuracy.
  
- User AndyTheGrump presents a strong argument for maintaining rigorous standards for health-related content on Wikipedia, emphasizing the importance of not making unverified health claims. This user's argument is grounded in Wikipedia's guidelines and the principle of not promoting commercial products without solid evidence.

- The unsigned comment introduces a specific scientific reference to support the argument for the benefits of polyphenols. However, it does not directly address how this evidence relates to the Monavie product, which is necessary for the argument to be relevant to the Monavie article.

Overall, the discussion shows a tension between the desire to present a balanced view of scientific evidence and the need to adhere to strict guidelines for health-related content. Both sides present valid points, but the discussion could benefit from a more focused examination of the evidence specifically related to Monavie, rather than polyphenols in general.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Yobol, could you explain me, why you killed any reference to:
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299912001471
? I am no physician, so could you explain me why that research is not relevant ?
The components look the same, what is the difference ? I am not after vindication or other crusades, I simply saw an interesting study. And any way, if it was really the suggestion of a vindication, is it so important ? And beside, there is not ""one"" truth, but all facts togheter help a better understanding.

<user_id=Yobol>
A discussion about di Bella needs to be sourced to a source that discusses di Bella.  Discussing it here when the source doesn't is original research.

<user_id=Robertiki>
Sorry, but I don't agree. Encyclopedia articles focus on all factual information to cover the thing or concept for which the article name stands. When I search an Encyclopedia, I expect to find together all relevant information or at least references or links. What about accuracy, objectivity, impartiality and fairness ? There is always another side of the story.

<user_id=Yobol>
What you (or I) ''believe should be'' allowed is irrelevant. Mentioning material/sources that doesn't discuss di Bella is not allowed, according to one of Wikipedia's core policies.

<user_id=Robertiki>
irrelevant ? Are we rude ? Anyway, I can't follow your reasoning. I read: ""The term ""original research"" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published sources exist. How does the citation of a reliable and published source infringe on the OR prohibition?

<user_id=Yobol>
WP:SYNTH would be the appropriate section. Adding a source that doesn't discuss di Bella to make or imply a conclusion about his theories is not allowed.

<user_id=Robertiki>
Wait! I did not reach or imply any conclusion! My text was: ""After the death of Di Bella, the European Journal of Pharmacology published on 15 April 2012, a study received the 22th July 2011, titled: ""Combined effects of melatonin and all-trans retinoic acid and somatostatin on breast cancer cell proliferation and death: Molecular basis for the anti cancer effect of these molecules"". No implication and no conclusion. What I thought was: ""Those interested, could look deeper at the study to see if it follows some how the Di Bella proposal.""

<user_id=Yobol>
Of course you did, by putting in this article. If you didn't mean to imply anything about di Bella, you wouldn't place it here.

<user_id=Robertiki>
conclusion = termination, final result, proposition deduced from previous ones; what I had is a ""indication"" = point out, make known, show. I insist: in my words there was no conclusion. Some readers, may be, could hastily reach, one or another conclusion, but the most would do some reaserch, taking the link as a hint.

<user_id=Yobol>
You implied it by putting it in this article. If you did not mean to imply a connection to di Bella, you would not have put it in this article.  This article is about di Bella. It needs sources that discusses di Bella.  It should not use sources that do not discuss di Bella.

<user_id=Robertiki>
True, I have implied a connection. But non a conclusion. The connection is that the study ""recalls"" Di Bella's research. But I have reached no conclusion. Connection and conclusion are not the same.

<user_id=Yobol>
Semantics aside, implying anything is not allowed. Implying something is WP:OR when the source does not make the implication.

<user_id=Yobol>
That source cannot be used in this article because it doesn't mention di Bella. I'm not sure what part of that you do not understand.

<user_id=Robertiki>
Which form should the information have to include http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299912001471 ? Could you give some examples ?

<user_id=Robertiki>
How should be a source that discusses di Bella in reference to that research, to gain your approval in this article ? What qualifications should the author have ? Should it be peer-reviewed ? Where should it be published ?

<user_id=Yobol>
See WP:MEDRS.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Understanding of Wikipedia Policies**: Both users are discussing Wikipedia's content policies, specifically original research (OR) and synthesis (SYNTH). Yobol is correctly citing Wikipedia's policies that prevent the inclusion of material that does not directly discuss the subject of the article (in this case, di Bella) and that prevent the synthesis of different sources to reach a new conclusion not explicitly stated by the sources themselves. Robertiki seems to misunderstand these policies, believing that any relevant information should be included for the sake of completeness.

2. **Relevance of the Source**: Robertiki is arguing for the inclusion of a study that does not mention di Bella but believes it is relevant because it recalls Di Bella's research. Yobol maintains that the source must directly discuss di Bella to be included in the article. Yobol's argument aligns with Wikipedia's policy on verifiability and relevance.

3. **Implication vs. Conclusion**: Robertiki tries to differentiate between implying a connection and reaching a conclusion, suggesting that the former should be permissible. However, Yobol correctly points out that even implying a connection without direct support from the source is considered original research, which is not allowed on Wikipedia.

4. **Quality of the Dialogue**: The dialogue is somewhat repetitive, with Robertiki not fully grasping the Wikipedia policies explained by Yobol. Yobol remains patient and tries to clarify the policies, but the conversation does not progress much in terms of reaching a mutual understanding.

5. **Constructiveness**: Yobol attempts to guide Robertiki towards understanding the policy by referring to WP:MEDRS (Wikipedia's medical sources guideline), which is constructive. However, Robertiki's questions about how to properly include the source suggest a lack of understanding of the core issue, which is not the form of the information but its direct relevance and the avoidance of original research.

Overall, the discussion quality is moderate. Yobol provides clear and consistent arguments based on Wikipedia's policies, while Robertiki's arguments show a lack of understanding of those policies. The discussion does not reach a productive conclusion, and there is a lack of progression in the understanding between the two parties.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5
"<user_id=Awien>
Whatever the script calls for (and is that the actual shooting script that's quoted? where's the ref?), what she says is '''I''' was perfect. That's also the only thing that makes dramatic sense, given the what a powerful element her quest for perfection is throughout the film, and given her desire to emulate Beth whom she perceives as perfect. Also, there's another typo in what's quoted: her'''e''' eyes glaze over . . .

<user_id=Awien>
IMDb also has I was perfect: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/quotes

<user_id=SubSeven>
How would it not make just as much sense for Nina to say ""it"" (her performance) was perfect?
Here is a link to the script referenced above.
Obviously just listening to the scene is not so conclusive, as different people hear one thing or the other.  But watch her mouth as she's saying it, and it's pretty clear she's forming the word 'it'.

<user_id=Awien>
You ask: How would it not make just as much sense for Nina to say ""it"" (her performance) was perfect? Because throughout she wants to '''be''' perfect, steals from Beth whom she wants to emulate because she '''is''' perfect.
As for the script, it's true that version calls for ""it"". But have you ever acted? Changes get made both accidentally and deliberately without the paper copy ever getting altered.

<user_id=Debresser>
So far we have a script and at least my personal opinion that she said ""It"". I think that both versions make sense. But unless we would have proof or consensus otherwise, we should keep what we have.

<user_id=Awien>
Some observations:
- That script was expressly prohibited to be performed, published, reproduced etc. etc. It appears to be pirated.
- It is by no means clear that it is the final version. We either don’t have or can’t see the colour-coded revisions mentioned at the beginning.
- Even if it was the final version, it could still have been changed during shooting.
- As far as I can see, everybody who blogged, commented, explained, quoted (inc. IMDb) on the basis of what they heard in the film percceived the last line as “I was perfect”.
- Sorry, but you are not a native speaker of English. I am. It makes a difference. I'm multilingual and a long-time language teacher, and I know. I hear ""I"".
- SubSeven had to force him/herself to hear ""it"" under the influence of the ""script"".
- Other people have tried before to correct the line to “I”.
- If the status quo is wrong, you change it.

<user_id=SubSeven>
I didn't have to force myself to hear anything.  I saw the film in theaters, December 2010, and I heard ""it was perfect"".  This is only confirmed now when I re-watch the scene, and also by reading her lips during the scene.   And if that was not the case, and I did want to argue for a change, I would make sure I had something more substantial than original research.

<user_id=Awien>
Absolutely take the quote out.

<user_id=Bbb23>
I don't care what the script says. I don't care what makes more sense dramatically. I also think that whether one is an English speaker or not is largely irrelevant; indeed, some non-English speakers are probably more tuned in than native speakers. And this business of I'm an expert and ""I know"" is frankly condescending. All that matters is what she said. At the moment, we have two editor who heard ""it"" and one who heard ""I"". Although consensus is not usually based on numbers, here numbers make some sense. So, leave it as ""it"". (In case any one cares, my preference would be to remove the quote from the plot completely and eliminate the need to spend this much energy on something so trivial. But, hey, this is Wikipedia, and that's not likely to happen.) — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

<user_id=Debresser>
I am not in favor of taking the quote out, but wouldn't oppose it actively either. All your objects to ""it"" are not substantial, IMHO, but the reasons to keep it are. So either it stays ""it"", or the sentence gets removed, but ""I"" is out of the question.

<user_id=Awien>
Debresser, you can't simply declare ""I"" to be out of the question. Setting aside what individuals perceive the word to be, we have documentation from two competing sources.
We have the quote as given by Internet Movie Database  which has the line as ""I was perfect"". IMDb is a high-profile and authoritative site, subject to a lot of scrutiny.
Then we have the pirated Moviecultists version of the script  but not at least SIX subsequent revisions mentioned right on the first page. [As a very obvious example of a difference between this script and the actual film, there's no mention of her being enveloped by the light, but that certainly happens]. There, the line is given as ""It was perfect"". So, not even the definitive script, coming from a not particularly authoritative source.
So unless you can back off from your excessive reliance on what is apparently only an early version of the script, and failing input from Portman or Aronofsky in person, I think we have to take the quote out.

<user_id=Awien>
Have edited acknowledging both versions rather than removing the quote entirely.

<user_id=Debresser>
And I have reverted you. Your edit was not discussed here, and I personally find it a bad idea.

<user_id=Bbb23>
I don't like the ""compromise"" either. Too much for too little and it's like airing our internal disagreement in public. When we have sources that conflict, sometimes we make note of that, but this is more a question of editors' hearing conflicting, and that's not something that belongs in the article.

<user_id=Validusername>
IMDb (taken alone) is a dubious source of information in cases like this, since much of its ""content is user-submitted and therefore not generally reliable"" as per (essay) WP:IMDB.  「」

<user_id=Awien>
My compromise was a real compromise, not a ""compromise"": it even-handedly mentioned both versions.  Debresser, you need to support your claim that that's a bad idea. Bbb23, it's hardly ""too much for too little"" given that it's the climactic line of the movie. Both of you, if IMDb is not an acceptable source, Moviecultists is no more acceptable.

<user_id=Awien>
But anyway, if compromise is unacceptable, we're left with delete. Bbb23, you already proposed it; Debresser, you ""wouldn't oppose it actively""; on that basis, I will remove the quote later this evening unless enough people indicate that they prefer compromise after all.

<user_id=Bbb23>
I don't see any hurry to remove it. I think you should wait longer than that. For one thing, Debresser is against removing the quote; he just said he wouldn't ""actively oppose"" it, not quite the same. I'd like to hear from more editors before removing it.

<user_id=Awien>
I'm going to try this again. There are incontrovertibly two views as to what the last sentence is. We could save a huge amount of time and effort by acknowledging that fact in half a dozen words added to the synopsis, and all move on. Yes?

<user_id=Awien>
In the absence of disagreement, I am restoring an unbiased statement of the fact that opinion is divided as to what her last words are. If anyone doesn't regard this as a fair compromise and reasonable solution to the problem, I would suggest you refrain from reverting it until you discuss the matter here.

<user_id=Bbb23>
I've reverted you. Either you obtain a consensus for your change(s) (not temporary silences), or you can take the matter to WP:DRN. This is a small issue, although one that some feel strongly about (not I), and your impatience and tendency toward unilateral action are not helpful.

<user_id=Bbb23>
@Awien, you are headed for a block. I've warned you on your talk page. You are now at 3 reverts. I will not block you as I am involved, but I will report you if you continue.

",1,"The discussion revolves around the interpretation of a line from the movie ""Black Swan,"" specifically whether the character Nina says ""I was perfect"" or ""It was perfect"" in the final scene. The quality of the arguments presented can be assessed based on several factors, including the use of evidence, adherence to Wikipedia's guidelines, and the tone of the discussion.

1. **Use of Evidence**: 
   - Awien argues that the line should be ""I was perfect,"" citing IMDb as a source and the dramatic context of the film. However, Validusername points out that IMDb is user-submitted and not always reliable.
   - SubSeven and Debresser reference a script that says ""It was perfect,"" but Awien counters that the script may not be the final version and could have been changed during shooting.

2. **Adherence to Wikipedia's Guidelines**: 
   - Bbb23 and Debresser emphasize the importance of consensus and not making changes based on original research or personal opinions. This aligns with Wikipedia's guidelines on verifiability and consensus-building.

3. **Tone and Conduct**: 
   - The tone of the discussion becomes somewhat contentious, with Awien being warned for potential edit warring and unilateral actions. This detracts from the overall quality of the discussion.

4. **Compromise and Resolution**: 
   - Awien proposes a compromise to acknowledge both interpretations in the article, but this is met with resistance from Debresser and Bbb23, who argue that it would reflect the editors' disagreement rather than provide clarity to the reader.

5. **Relevance and Coherence**: 
   - The arguments are relevant to the topic at hand and are generally coherent. However, the discussion becomes circular, with repeated assertions rather than new evidence or perspectives being introduced.

Considering these factors, the discussion shows some understanding of Wikipedia's policies and a willingness to engage with different viewpoints, but it is marred by a lack of consensus, reliance on potentially unreliable sources, and a tone that at times becomes unconstructive. The quality of the arguments is average, with some editors providing reasonable points, while others seem less willing to consider alternative evidence or compromise.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5
"<user_id=Wikiwiserick>
Just a question

<user_id=Wikiwiserick>
Do you have some knowledge about the artist, HA Schult? And are you sure that the information you have deleted, is wrong? I don't think so. Therefore, please do not remove contributions based on reliable sources such as catalogs, books and articles on the artist.

<user_id=Rhode Island Red>
It's not a question of right or wrong; merely whether or not the text is reliably sourced  a fundamental rule of WP:BIO. I did not remove anything that was properly sourced.

<user_id=Wikiwiserick>
The text is reliably sourced, as there are many references to exhibition catalogs, oeuvre catalogs, books and articles on the artist written by art critics and art historians.

<user_id=Rhode Island Red>
Once again, I did not remove anything that was reliable sourced so it's unclear to which edits you are referring.

<user_id=Wikiwiserick>
Most of the details given in the text can be found in the many publications on the artist. Schult is well known in Germany and also internationally recognized. As you are still removing important information from the Wikipedia article, you may consult the many press releases and articles cited on this page in order to get a first impression on the artist's life and work. However, we can leave the two tags on the Wikipedia page if you are happy with them, though I do not think that they are necessary. But do not remove material written by Wikipedians who are better informed on the subject than you.

<user_id=Rhode Island Red>
Uh...no need for the uppity attitude or boasting. Since you are writing the article, the onus is on you to provide in line citations that support every statement. It's just that simple. Kindly refrain from edit warring and just follow protocol. Thanks.

<user_id=Wikiwiserick>
Sorry, you are the person who questions the sources I have used, although you do not seem to be well informed about Schult. You have even deleted a quote from the Deutsche Welle, falsely claiming that it is self-published. I do not think that this is an appropriate behavior in the given situation.

<user_id=Rhode Island Red>
Whether or not I am ""well informed"" about HA Schult is irrelevant, and you aren't doing yourself any favors by repeatedly making this accusation and suggesting that the problem here is my ignorance of this barely notable German garbage artist's contributions to society rather than your noncompliance with WP:RS and WP:VER. The DW article in question listed Shult's name underlined at the top, so it's easy to mistake him as the author. Nonetheless, when a source says something vague along the lines of ""art critics say he is a modern day (whatever)"", it carries little weight unless the critics are named (as per WP:REDFLAG). More importantly, you previously challenged me to consult ""the many press releases and articles cited"" about Schult, but this is clearly a fools errand because the source that was cited most often (6 out of the 12 citations) is an obscure out of print 1978 publication in German (i.e., ''HA Schult der Macher'') for which you provided no link that would enable verification. This raises an issue at to whether the artist is even notable enough to warrant a WP entry in English Wikipedia.

<user_id=Rhode Island Red>
I've looked at a few more sources and I think I the argument for notability is fairly sound. That aside, I think the main issue here is that the article relies too heavily on that one old obscure source in German (''HA Schult der Macher''). The article would be better if it relied less on this one source (it accounts for 6 of the 12 references cited) and included more content from reliable English sources, like ArtNews, and and these which aren't cited yet. I also noticed that ArtNews said that his work had been ""compared"" to that of Christo, which IMO is a better source and a better quote (more neutral) than the slightly more exaggerated one saying that he ""has been called the 'German Christo' for the epic scale of his work"", although, really, an argument could be made for the latter as well. You know, you're not really far away from having a good article about Schult, and I'll be happy to work with you going forward to bring it up to the highest caliber.

<user_id=Rhode Island Red>
And BTW, if you are the artist himself, or a second party writing on his behalf, that's OK too. If that's the case, it might be worth reading WP:COI, but having a COI doesn't necessarily preclude you from contributing (although in some situations it's at least frowned upon) or require that you reveal your identity (although such transparency is encouraged in the case of a COI). If you need input, I'll be happy to help out. I actually think some of the artist's works/happenings are pretty interesting...especially the plane crash into the NY garbage dump. My issue is just that I'm a stickler for procedure and good encyclopedic writing.

<user_id=Wikiwiserick>
I partly do not understand your argument. I am not Schult himself, but I am well informed about his work. Just for your information: the 398-page publication, ''HA Schult der Macher'' is an oeuvre catalog of the artist, edited by four authors and including essays written by German art historians, reprints from newspaper articles dealing with the artist's happenings, and discussions of all works by Schult previous to the publication date. It is the standard publication on the early work of Schult. Therefore, it is quoted six times in the first part of the article. However, I am thankful for your help if it does improve this article.

<user_id=Rhode Island Red>
Be that as it may, it's an obscure, very old, and out of print source, so it can't be readily verified  it's not ideal IMO; it would be much better to find secondary sources in English that quote the original source. And in what way do you think that the work is a ""standard publication"" about Schult? What standards are you referring to? Are you saying that he is a subject of academic interest and academic articles are citing this older work? As I said before, it's best not to lean on a single source too heavily because the article needs to reflect a balanced POV of the subject; not the POV of a single source, and in this case, the source in question is particularly problematic for verification.

<user_id=Wikiwiserick>
This publication is the best and most complete source on the early work of the artist. I still do not understand your argument. There are many excellent publications on artists now out of print. What is of more interest to me in order to improve the article, however, is to add some more illustrations, for instance this one, which I found on the Internet, or a similar one, as it shows the influence of Caspar David Friedrich on the artist.

<user_id=Rhode Island Red>

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Source Reliability and Verification**: Rhode Island Red emphasizes the importance of reliable sourcing and the ability to verify information, which is a fundamental aspect of Wikipedia's content guidelines (WP:RS and WP:VER). This is a strong argument because it ensures the integrity of the information presented on Wikipedia.

2. **Notability and Relevance**: Rhode Island Red questions the notability of HA Schult and the reliance on a single, potentially obscure source. This is a valid point because Wikipedia requires subjects to be notable and information to be verifiable by multiple reliable sources (WP:NOTE).

3. **Accusations of Ignorance**: Wikiwiserick accuses Rhode Island Red of not being well-informed about HA Schult. This is a weaker argument as it shifts the focus from the content and sourcing to personal knowledge, which is not directly relevant to the discussion of the article's quality.

4. **Compliance with Wikipedia Policies**: Rhode Island Red's insistence on compliance with Wikipedia's sourcing policies is a strong argument because it aligns with the platform's standards for creating and editing articles.

5. **Use of a Single Source**: Rhode Island Red points out the over-reliance on a single source, which could introduce bias or a lack of comprehensive coverage. This is a strong argument because Wikipedia encourages a neutral point of view and a diversity of sources.

6. **Offer to Collaborate**: Rhode Island Red offers to collaborate with Wikiwiserick to improve the article, which is a constructive approach and aligns with the collaborative nature of Wikipedia.

7. **Conflict of Interest**: Rhode Island Red brings up the potential for a conflict of interest (WP:COI) and suggests transparency. This is a strong argument because it addresses Wikipedia's guidelines on neutrality and potential bias.

8. **Edit Warring**: The final comment by Obelisk29 addresses the issue of edit warring, which is a valid concern as it disrupts the collaborative editing process and goes against Wikipedia's guidelines (WP:EW).

Overall, the discussion includes a mix of strong arguments that align with Wikipedia's policies and weaker arguments that focus on personal knowledge and accusations. The dialogue shows an effort to resolve the issue through policy adherence and collaboration, which is positive. However, the discussion also includes elements of tension and potential edit warring, which detracts from the overall quality.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

The Germans lost 2.2 million dead in World War One.  In 1916 there were two of the largest battles of the War, the Somme, and Germany's attack at Verdun.  I would find it hard to believe that they only had 143,000 deaths (6.5% of the total War dead) on the entire Western Front for the whole of 1916,  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=Keith-264>
The French and German army Western Front losses were greatest in 1914 and 1918. Battles of attrition were less costly than open warfare and battles intended to create open warfare, by breaking through opposing defences. Because they were limited in extent and ambition they were much longer longer, dead if you did, dead if you didn't.

Keith, I was following the WP Be Bold suggestion, which seems to me to say that ""asking"" first is neither required, nor even desired. As to faith in readers' literacy, surely you'd agree there's a sensible level of material that is suitable for any given publication? As to opinion, I mentioned that the Google search incidence of the phrase ""anglophone monoglots"" is barely over 500. In other words, it is *astoundingly* rare. I, a native English speaker, had to follow the links to find out what you meant. I suggest that forcing a reader to use links for meaning is less than ideal, particularly where a far more accessible option  ""English-speakers""  is perfectly sufficient. In the context of your sentence, ""English-speakers"" would be taken by most readers (since you are talking about the lack of translations of non-English documents) to mean ""English-only-speakers"".

<user_id=Keith-264>
The boldness is in editing but when there is an objection it should be taken to the talk page to try to reach consensus, which is what you did - thank you but we are not obliged to treat dissent as sufficient to establish facts, particularly when opinion is masked by reference to hypothetical readers. I don't much care for Google and your point is OR which is unWiki. Here is something which Wiki provides:
Battle_of_the_Somme has been viewed 42,213 times in the last 30 days. One complaint in 42,213 views doesn't seem to me to indicate a problem.

<user_id=Thomask0>
It's good that you deign to welcome constructive criticism of what is clearly, from several exchanges that have been initiated with you on this talk page, what you consider to be ''your'' article. So, in the spirit of you welcoming such criticism, I point you to Wikipedia:Ownership_of_articles.

I think it's accurate enough - though probably not great prose style as there are ways to convey the same point without using such obscure vocabulary.

<user_id=Keith-264>

However, Keith-264's repeated rapid reverts on this point, demonstrate that we have an ""owner"" problem with this Article. (Perhaps we need a move request, to rename the article ""Keith's Battle of the Somme Article""). But in fact there is an even more important point at stake here, but also one that has been pointed out before and rejected by Keith The Owner; namely that the article's introduction is simply too long and detailed. And certainly that contentious paragraph is utterly out of place '''in the introduction'''. Keith The Owner may know something about WW1, but he clearly has a lot to learn about what it takes to be an encyclopedist. Compare this article with, for example, Britannica's article.  The information WP carries may be fine (albeit the prose is, as you say, not great) but the problem is that it seems only Keith The Owner's opinions carry weight here. I've udone Keith-264's reversion since he is now reverting several people on the same point. And, as per discussion with another poster further down this page, and in line with other encyclopedia formats, I've moved the ""criticism"" paragraphs out of the lead of the article and into a specific ""Criticisms"" subsection. I hope Keith The Owner will be good enough to '''DISCUSS HERE FIRST''' before reverting once again.

<user_id=Keith-264>
Please stop using procedural chicanery and personal abuse and stick to the point, which is a difference of opinion about a form of words. There was no need to start a subsection, it was already there in the Aftermath section. There should have been one revert and then a discussion here to achieve consensus, not name-calling and ganging up. If consensus can't be achieved, the nest step is to request a third party to arbitrate. I suggest we try it.

<user_id=Thomask0>
I disagree. As I said earlier, this is not whether ''your'' opinions are correct or not. This is an open discussion among ''anyone'' who is interested. So I suggest we wait and see if anyone else wants to comment.

<user_id=Rjensen>
the literacy part is in bad taste and of dubious quality. It deals with historiography (not history) and that should be in a separate section where I put it. It does not fit in the lede. Unsourced claims of course are not allowed.

<user_id=Keith-264>
I disagree I was trying to achieve consensus. This isn't a beauty contest. I have made an individual approach to Oz Rupert asking for his good offices.

<user_id=Thomask0>
But we're not going to achieve consensus unless we give others the time to contribute. You can approach Oz and his (her?) ""good offices"" as much as you like, but we still have to take his opinions as only *part* of an overall view  i.e. of a consensus. There are other people who may want to show an interest and surely it is sensible to let them contribute first?

<user_id=Keith-264>
See comment below.

<user_id=Rjensen>
Historiography sections are usually near the end of the article, so I moved the historiography from the lead to that position, and use the section heading ""historiography"" to alert readers that this is about the historians of the battle. I also added numerous citations from they scholarly periodical literature. They appear to demonstrate that the participants are fully familiar with the German and French scholarship.  Keith-264  has a mysterious problem with this This is the place for him to explain himself.  As for the mysterious English scholars who cannot read German and French, Keith-264 has not named any of these writers, nor has he provided  a citation to any RS that claims that the basis of the problem is that ""anglophone monoglots"" are unable to obtain a translation of French or German books and articles.

<user_id=Rjensen>
There is no dispute, only an edit war waged by one editor Keith-264 who had great difficulty expressing his analysis of the Somme.

<user_id=Thomask0>
You mentioned that there ''""was no need to start a subsection, it was already there in the Aftermath section...""'' That may be a fair point; I hadn't noticed that piece. However, now that the ""Historiography"" section has been added, usefully I think, there's a case for moving that paragraph down from ""Aftermath"" to join the rest of the text in ""Historiography"". Of course, there's an alternative argument that would push the ""Historiography"" up to join the ""Aftermath"" text. I'm not fussed either way, but I'd defer to history experts  i.e. those who know what the heck ""Historiography"" actually means in practical use  on the matter. All that said, my original point was that regardless of where it moves to, it needs to move '''out of the lead'''. That, and the removal of ""anglophone monoglots"", remain my proposal.

<user_id=Thomask0>
I've no idea what that comment refers to.

<user_id=Rjensen>
I moved the paragraph into the historiography section where it belongs.  The history sections talk about soldiers and battles, the historiography section talks about historians and how they debate interpret and analyze the history. Historiography is taught in every University history department, so it has nothing novel.

<user_id=Thomask0>
Sounds fine. I don't doubt that historiography can refer to a subject, as it were, it was just that a superficial glance at various dictionaries said, to my non-historian eyes, that it sometimes just means ""writing history"". I suspect you're using it in the more technical and precise sense of ""writing about the writing of history"", which makes sense in the context of Wikipedia and particularly of Wikipedia history articles. So given that, is there a case for moving the related paragraph from ""Aftermath"" down to augment the Historiography section? As I say, I wouldn't have a problem with it being in either place, but it may make sense to have it in only *one* place. Shrug.

Oops. I see you already did -).

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Argument about the number of deaths in WWI**: The initial argument presented by the first user questions the accuracy of the number of German deaths on the Western Front in 1916. However, this user does not provide any sources or evidence to support their claim, making it difficult to evaluate the strength of their argument.

2. **Discussion of battle strategies and casualties**: Keith-264 provides a general statement about the nature of attrition warfare and its relation to casualties, which is relevant to the discussion but does not directly address the specific concern about the number of deaths.

3. **Use of language and accessibility**: Thomask0 raises a valid point about the use of the term ""anglophone monoglots,"" which may not be widely understood by the general readership of Wikipedia. This argument is about clarity and accessibility, which are important aspects of Wikipedia's guidelines.

4. **Ownership and article quality**: Thomask0 and The Land discuss the issue of article ownership and prose style, suggesting that the article may not be following Wikipedia's best practices for neutrality and clarity. Keith-264 defends his position but does not address the specific concerns about prose and ownership.

5. **Historiography and article structure**: Rjensen and Thomask0 discuss the placement of historiography within the article, which is a relevant point about the organization and clarity of the article's content. They seem to reach a consensus on moving the historiography content to a more appropriate section.

6. **Consensus and edit warring**: There is a recurring theme of seeking consensus and avoiding edit warring. Keith-264 suggests seeking a third-party arbitrator, which is a constructive approach to resolving disputes on Wikipedia. However, there is also an accusation of edit warring from Rjensen, which suggests a breakdown in the collaborative process.

7. **Personal attacks and procedural issues**: There are instances of personal attacks and accusations of procedural chicanery, which detract from the overall quality of the discussion. Wikipedia's guidelines discourage personal attacks and encourage civil discourse.

Overall, the discussion includes some relevant and constructive points about article clarity, organization, and the importance of consensus. However, the quality of the discussion is diminished by the lack of evidence provided for some claims, the presence of personal attacks, and the focus on ownership issues rather than content improvement.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Which formula for the true period should be used?

<user_id=Crowsnest>
The nonlinear pendulum has been studied  and published about  for a long time. Eq. (2) is from a very recent publication, and has not been referenced (yet) in other publications, while the series in Eq. (1) (and similar series) are of widespread use. So, I would say that WP:UNDUE applies, and Eq. (2) should not be included.

<user_id=Maschen>
Agreed, in addition these refs

<user_id=Maschen>
each give (Θ = angular amplitude):

While this ref:

<user_id=Maschen>
gives:

<user_id=Maschen>
for small amplitudes (they use ''a'' = Θ):

<user_id=Maschen>
and we should use what most sources use, so the first is certainly justified.

<user_id=Zueignung>
It looks like this arithmetic-geometric mean formula is not entirely novel; it appears as a combination of equations 3 and 15 in this Am J Phys paper by Carvalhaes and Suppes (vol. 26, no. 12, p. 1150). At any rate, I agree with those who say that it is fine material for the corresponding mathematics article but probably shouldn't be included here. It seems like a relatively obscure formula, and surely anyone who is interested in optimal methods of numerically computing the period of a pendulum will find their way to the full mathematics article.

<user_id=Chetvorno>
I removed the second formula in compliance with the consensus above but  added it back again.  , Let's talk about this here, and come to a consensus, before making changes.   ''''

<user_id=193.233.212.18>
Hiding the best formula formula is hardly consistent with the principles of the wikipedia for free and wide access to human knowledge. Even the question of removing it ought not be posed. Furthermore, it's well referenced and need not necessarliy be derived here. A more general derivation would be appropriate when the topic of elliptic integrals is being discussed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=Dbfirs>
I would challenge your claim that yours is the ""best"" formula, since it relies on an obscure mean, but at least we have a linked article to explain the obscurity.  I would tend to agree that the unusual formula (or perhaps both versions?) should go in the mathematical version of the article.  Should we just link to the other article for the more complex formulas?

<user_id=Martinvl>
I agree with  that only one formula should be used.  This artcile, unlike the artcile Pendulum (mathematics) is about the physics of the pendulum. Since physicists often disregard ""small terms"", the first equation is the appropriate form to use - the reader can see immediately that for small θ, the θ2 can often be ignored while the θ4 becomes vanishingly small in practice.  This article rightly makes a reference to the mathematics of the pendulum, there is no need to clutter up the discussion here with equation 2 - an equation that cannot be easily programmed into an EXCEL spreadsheet.

<user_id=Chetvorno>
Also the article actually refers to the first equation; in Early observations in 1747  it tells how Bernoulli developed the method of using the 2nd term of the series ''θ02''/16 to correct the period of gravimeter pendulums for the finite length of swing. ''''

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Reference to Existing Literature and Precedence**: The participants discuss the relevance of the formulas based on their presence in existing literature and how widely they have been referenced. This is a strong argument because it relies on the scientific principle of consensus and the weight of multiple validations.

2. **Applicability to the Subject Matter**: The distinction between the physics of the pendulum and the mathematics of the pendulum is made, suggesting that the simpler formula is more appropriate for the physics article. This is a logical argument because it considers the audience and the context of the information.

3. **Complexity and Accessibility**: There is a concern about the complexity of the second formula and its accessibility to the general audience, which might not be familiar with the arithmetic-geometric mean. This is a valid point, as Wikipedia aims to be accessible to a broad audience.

4. **Historical Context and Relevance**: The historical use of the first equation is mentioned, which adds to its relevance for the article. This is a good argument because it ties the formula to the historical development of the field.

5. **Consensus and Collaboration**: The participants are engaging in a collaborative discussion to reach a consensus, which is a positive aspect of the discussion. They are considering different viewpoints and trying to come to an agreement.

6. **Allegations of Conflict of Interest**: One participant raises concerns about a potential conflict of interest, which is a serious consideration in maintaining the neutrality of the article. However, this is not expanded upon with evidence, so it's a weaker argument in this context.

7. **Practicality**: The argument that the first equation can be easily programmed into a tool like an EXCEL spreadsheet is practical and considers the usability of the information.

Overall, the discussion is well-structured, with participants providing reasoned arguments and considering the implications of their choices for the readership. They are focused on maintaining the quality and accessibility of the article, which are key aspects of Wikipedia's guidelines.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.0",8.0
"<user_id=Croq>

<user_id=Director>
This is about linguistics not politics. In the Balkans linguistics (and science in general) are consistently influenced by politics, communist or nationalist to equal extent. Local publications are therefore to be disregarded without exception, both from the pre-1990 or post-1990 periods.

<user_id=Director>
Croq, your ideological references and borderline personal attacks serve only to apparently satisfy you, other than that I cannot imagine any effect. Don't let me stop you though...

<user_id=Chipmunkdavis>
Croq has now done exactly the same edit twice, even though it was reverted the first time.

<user_id=Croq>
Croq changed in every edit some details. But you are reverting everytime without discussion. Same as it happened in Ex Yugoslavia when the communists tryed to establish their ""Yugoslav Language"". Really interesting POV pushing team here..

<user_id=Director>
I'm sure we'd all be glad to play the bad guys in your glorious crusade here, but I'm afraid Wikipedia is not the venue. You have been reverted, your edits are opposed, and you are engaged in a WP:EDIT WAR. In accordance with Wiki guidelines I am formally warning you to cease attempting to push your opposed edit via edit-warring, and achieve consensus on the talkpage via discussion prior to restoring any of it again.

<user_id=Chipmunkdavis>
Apparently we are a bunch of POV pushing vandals. Croq is threatening to report me to admins for POV pushing on my , probably in response to me warning him. Besides, I didn't see any major changes in any of the edits Croq made. They all pretty much said the same things, such as ""hybrid language"" and ""communist yugoslavia"" that were blatant POV pushing.

<user_id=Croq>
There are so many reasons why this article is pure POV: You removed that this language is controversial (and everybody knows very well that this is a fact), the sentence with the Novi Sad Agreement of and so many other things. This pseudo-language is a part of history of Yugoslavia when the dictators tried to establish a ""Yugoslav Language"". It ended in the same way as their general Ratko Mladic, Slobodan Milosevic and so many others ended. Please accept that the history is not written by the guys like them and that democracy and freedom has won against tyranism.

<user_id=JorisvS>
Removing mentioning its controversial status within former Yugoslavia, especially Croatia, is, of course, POV. However, trying to deny its factual existence is equally POV: speakers of both (standard) Croatian and Serbian can easily understand eachother, making SC a language from a linguistic-scientific perspective; such things do not cease to be (or come to be) when the political situation changes. As an encyclopedia we have an obligation to report this (and the other) facts, no matter the sensitivities. (We thus must also report dictators' abuses concerning the language.) Also note that SC≠Yugoslav language here.

<user_id=Director>
The language is not ""controversial"" in ex-Yugoslavia - its existence is simply not an issue. Each state promotes its own centralized standard language, and adherence to the ever-changing standard is not an issue of debate. Serbo-Croatian is considered not to be in existence in any form and is simply not a subject of controversy at all.
In other words, in ex-Yugoslavia a language's existence is generally considered to be defined by its standardization. Since no political organization or institution standardizes Serbo-Croatian, it is considered ""not to exist"" simply because of that, and since the myriad nationalist political institutions of each state institute each their own language, these are considered to be in existence (no matter how absurd their separation may be, e.g. Bosnian language, Montenegrin language, etc.) The above is evident from the responses of the opposing parties. Wikipedia, just like the scientific community, is not to be influenced by political institutions.

<user_id=Croq>
No, Director. We know very well the phasis of political tryal to create a ""Yugoslav Language"" thert SC should become. But it ended in the same way as the whole country. And stop calling poeple that do not share your unitartistic opinion as ""nationalists"". By the way ist is the same way like comunists called those who oppose their dictatoirship and fought for freedom in their countries as dissidents.

<user_id=Croq>
That is not truth, it contoversal there, too. The people know very well there which language they speak. In the croatian or serbian wikipedia such a discussion is not necessary.´

<user_id=Croq>
Yes, JorisvS, we agree that the the status is controversal. By the way not only in ""Ex-YU"" but also other lingists. So lets put it in the article in the beginning.

<user_id=Director>
Crusade, crusade, communists, freedom, unitarianists, etc... I see no sense in responding to such rot. Croq, you are not getting the message, please read the following very carefully and please do not ignore it in future posts: this issue has ''nothing'' to do with politics and history. Nothing. You seem not to know what matters on Wikipedia. If you want to be taken seriously you should cease writing these utterly pointless essays and start referring to the international scientific community... or you could just keep posting these insulting pretentious proclamations, I don't know... this is not the backwater dump that is hrWiki.

<user_id=Director>
Oh laugh-out-loud what nonsense... you're actually opposing me while agreeing with me. D Very telling, I think, about the usefullness of any discussion along these lines.

<user_id=83.131.49.180>
On a side note, Croq's only valid point of the language being politically controversial is thoroughly covered in the HUUUGE Present situation section.

<user_id=Croq>
SC is not only political controversal. Thats´s only one point. The second one is also that it i POV pushing that Croatian, Serbian, Bosniak, Montenegrin are the same languages. They are similar but not the same. I guess for not native speakers maybe difficult to understand (same as if a native english speaker would start teaching me about something) but not accespting that Croats, Serbs, Montenegrins and Bosniaks do not know it is very arrogant.

<user_id=Ivan Štambuk>
No, they're not the same. They just happen to be 99% the same by the fact that they are all standardized on the same subdialect of the same dialect. Modern standard Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian have the same phonology, the same complex accentual system, same complex inflection, almost the same syntax... The only relevant differences are in some 5% of lexis of which majority are systematic and intuitively predictable (in Croatia they prefer ''-telj'' where sometimes in Serbia they prefer ''-lac'', and similar). You need to stop downplaying obvious commonalities/similarities among the standards and dispense with abusive political name-calling. Your personal nationalist identity is of no concern us.

<user_id=213.103.160.194>
No Mr Stambuk, you personal non qualification is so obvious for native speakers that you can sell you wisedom only to wikipedians who are not native speakers. Forget it, don´t play here with percentages, they don´t keep water. You are wasting time with your personal wiki  project.

<user_id=Chipmunkdavis>
Per wikipedia policy, unqualified average serbs/croats/bosniks/montenegrins (sorry if denonyms are slightly off) would probably hold less water on this article than others, due to an inherent POV. That is not to say that their opinions are not important. And percentages do keep water, they are base facts.

<user_id=Director>
Just to be perfectly clear: the languages are ''completely'' mutually intelligible. The Slovene language is a separate South Slavic language ''very'' similar to Serbo-Croatian, and a Serbo-Croatian speaker may understand some Slovene words, perhaps even the general meaning of what the Slovene-speaker is trying to say. On the other hand, a Serb and a Croat may often not even realize they (supposedly) speak ""different languages"". In other words, its much easier to list the very few differences than the completely common grammar between Croatian and Serbian. Anyone demanding ""translation"" from Croatian to Serbian or ''vice versa'' would not be understood as being serious and would literally be ''laughed at'' (as was actually the case during a trial in Bosnia and Herzegovina).

<user_id=Director>
The absurdities go on and on... Croatian supposedly has two secondary dialects, Chakavian and Kajkavian, the differences between standard Croatian and its two dialects are vastly and incomparably greater than those between standard Croatian and standard Serbian (as both are based on Shtokavian), to the point its not even debatable. I'm not kidding - pure Kajkavian and Chakavian are virtually ''unintelligible'' to a standard Croatian speaker, with very different syntax and a ''LOT'' more different words than you'll find comparing Serbian or Croatian. The absurdity is this: Croq will undoubtedly tell you that Chakavian and Kajkavian are the same language as Croatian, but will exclaim that Serbian is ""much too different"" to be the same language. And not just him, most people from Croatia will tell you the same P

<user_id=89.172.55.34>
I would just like to add - Kajkavian (especially the versions spoken around the Gorski kotar area, probably those in Medjimurje too) is actually more similar to Slovene and probably easier to understand for a native Slovene speaker than for a native (stokavian) speaker of Croatian.

<user_id=Director>
Exactly, which further blurs the language differences: if Kajkavian is a Serbo-Croatian dialect, then Slovene can also be considered as part of the single ""Serbo-Croato-Slovene language"", which was official 1918-1943/45. This of course is an out of date concept today, and generally more debatable.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Understanding of the Topic**: The discussion revolves around the linguistic classification of Serbo-Croatian and its relation to Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin languages. The participants are debating whether these languages are distinct or if they are dialects of a single language. Some participants reference historical attempts to standardize a Yugoslav language and the political implications of such efforts.

2. **Factual Accuracy**: There are references to historical events such as the Novi Sad Agreement and the political situation in former Yugoslavia, which are accurate and relevant to the discussion. The mention of mutual intelligibility and the standardization of languages is also factually correct and pertinent to the linguistic debate.

3. **Relevance**: Most participants are focused on the linguistic aspects of the debate, which is relevant to the article in question. However, there are instances where the discussion veers into personal attacks and political ideologies, which detract from the overall quality.

4. **Coherence**: The arguments presented by some participants, such as Director and Ivan Štambuk, are coherent and based on linguistic facts and standards. They argue for the mutual intelligibility of the languages and the commonalities in grammar and vocabulary. On the other hand, Croq's arguments are less coherent, often conflating linguistic and political issues and resorting to nationalistic rhetoric.

5. **Rhetorical Strategies**: Some participants, like Director, use rhetorical strategies such as reductio ad absurdum to highlight the inconsistencies in Croq's arguments. Others, like Ivan Štambuk, rely on linguistic data and percentages to make their point. Croq, however, uses emotionally charged language and appeals to nationalism, which are less effective in a factual debate.

6. **Civility**: The discussion includes instances of incivility and personal attacks, particularly from Croq, which diminishes the quality of the debate. The use of terms like ""POV pushing vandals"" and ""tyranism"" are not conducive to a constructive discussion.

Overall, the discussion has elements of high-quality debate, particularly from those who focus on linguistic facts and avoid political entanglement. However, the quality is brought down by instances of incivility, personal attacks, and the conflation of linguistic arguments with political ideologies.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

There remains nothing constructive about the Criticism section, it just reads like complaints from angry users, not anything from critics of note, research ect. What value does it pose and how can it be cleaned up?

<user_id=Sirtaptap>
Upon further inspection, the Criticism section is almost the sole work of one author (apparently with a chip on his shoulder) and I've removed the most irrelevant bits. If reddit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit) doesn't have a Criticism section I fail to see why Stack Exchange Network should have one.

<user_id=Renesis>
I've blanked the whole section.  The only sources for criticism whatsoever were two blog articles.  Blogs are self-published sources and as such are not notable (""Anyone can create a personal web page or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field."") with very few exceptions (such as an established expert in the relevant field who has been published by ''reliable'' third-parties).  I oppose any readdition of criticism until a reliable source is established that shows the criticism under discussion is owed due weight.

<user_id=Sirtaptap>
Perfectly acceptable. The non-blog posts were just questions from the site's feedback forum; angry user comments belong on the feedback forum, not on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a vector to air grievances.

<user_id=Sirtaptap>
The general description of the site is perfectly acceptable for a basic article. Your personal grievances with the site are not.

<user_id=Sirtaptap>
You're the only one that's written the section. It's clearly a pet project of yours. All of the ""sources"" are angry user feedback. Angry user emails/support calls/ect would not be considered notable for other resources. Do you think I could cite a wikipedia talk page rant in a Criticism section on the page on Wikipedia? It's absurd. And Critcism sections appear to be quite rare (and short, if they exist) for similar web sites. Even 4chan doesn't have a criticism section, nor does reddit, Slashdot, Qoura ect. Wikipedia is not a place for rants. Express your grievances to Stack Exchange Network directly not by making it's Wikipedia article a laundry list of your personal problems with it.

I am going to rewrite the section myself. Or let someone else rewrite it, but currently it is against WP:UNDUE, [[WP:NEUTRAL, and WP:RELY.

I ''do agree'' that my rewriting ''may be against WP:NEUTRAL as well'', I plan to put it up for review later (I also shall ask at WP:VPP for clarification on this). Profile deletion only happens if you follow the instructions under ""contact us"" (there's a form for account deletion somewhere there). Re: connecting the two: your reply seems to just confirm that the two are connected.  Re: Criticism of Wikipedia: Again, read WP:UNDUE. There are ''lots'' of pages on Wikipedia, a large Criticism page isn't undue weight. On the other hand, there are very few pages about SE on Wikipedia.

Re: ""Only content is to be judged here""  We need to ensure that the article is written from a neutral point of view. A disgruntled user writing a criticism article seems like a rant (I do agree that blanking it was not the best course of action given my affiliation).

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Relevance of Criticism Section**: The initial argument by Sirtaptap is that the Criticism section of the Stack Exchange Network article on Wikipedia is not constructive and seems to be a collection of complaints rather than notable criticism from reliable sources. This is a valid point, as Wikipedia guidelines require that content be verifiable and come from reliable sources.

2. **Comparison to Other Articles**: Sirtaptap compares the Stack Exchange Network article to other articles like Reddit, which do not have a Criticism section. This comparison is used to question the necessity of such a section. While this is a reasonable point, the presence or absence of a section in one article does not necessarily dictate its relevance in another, as each subject may have different levels of criticism in reliable sources.

3. **Source Quality**: Renesis supports the removal of the Criticism section due to the lack of reliable sources, which is in line with Wikipedia's content policies. This is a strong argument because it is based on Wikipedia's standards for source quality.

4. **Personal Grievances**: Sirtaptap argues that personal grievances do not belong on Wikipedia and that the Criticism section seems to be a personal project of one user. This is a relevant point, as Wikipedia is not a platform for individuals to air personal grievances but rather an encyclopedia that should reflect a neutral point of view.

5. **Neutral Point of View**: Manishearth acknowledges the potential bias in rewriting the section due to their affiliation with Stack Exchange and plans to seek a review to maintain neutrality. This shows an understanding of Wikipedia's neutrality policy and a willingness to adhere to it.

6. **Undue Weight**: Manishearth also brings up the policy of undue weight, arguing that the Criticism section takes up a disproportionate amount of the article. This is a valid concern, as Wikipedia guidelines state that articles should not give undue weight to certain viewpoints.

7. **Privacy and Cyberbullying Accusations**: The discussion takes a turn when the anonymous user accuses Manishearth of cyberbullying by linking to profiles. Manishearth's response is brief and dismissive. This part of the discussion is less constructive, as it devolves into personal accusations rather than focusing on the content and policies of Wikipedia.

8. **Content Judgment and Bias**: The anonymous user claims to be more neutral than Manishearth due to not being an avid user of Stack Exchange. However, neutrality is not solely determined by one's use of a platform but by the ability to adhere to Wikipedia's guidelines and present information fairly.

Overall, the discussion includes several strong arguments that align with Wikipedia's guidelines on source reliability, neutrality, and undue weight. However, the quality of the discussion is somewhat diminished by the personal nature of some comments and the lack of focus on improving the article constructively in the latter part of the dialogue.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Was Murphy a racist?

<user_id=Sunray>
I'm reading the ''Black Candle'' and note that her thinking is much more sophisticated than this article gives her credit for.  I think it would make sense to use direct quotes from her for issues relating to eugenics, immigration and race.  It is ''way'' off the mark to call her a racist.  She was actually fairly innovative in her thinking, counselled against knee-jerk racism, and developed some fairly enlightened approaches to dealing with drugs.

<user_id=Themightyquill>
Wow, I can't believe I missed the link to the book. Thanks for pointing it out. I definitely think you're right that the article unfairly portrays her thinking as simplistic. She clearly doesn't fit into the yellow peril, Asiatic Exclusion League hysteria of the day, but I certainly don't think it's ''way'' off the mark to call her a racist:
One becomes especially disquieted—almost terrified—in face of these things, for it sometimes seems as if the white race lacks both the physical and moral stamina to protect itself, and that maybe the black and yellow races may yet obtain the ascendancy. Indeed, this seems possible—even probable—unless the enslavement which comes from these abhorrent and debasing narcotics can be strongly and speedily dealt with.
She's not ''blaming'' asians or blacks for the decline of ""whites,"" (though she says later that they seem to enjoy watching white men fall) but her anti-drug politics are couched eugenics, her framework is racial, and she is clearly determined to ""preserve the white race."" Certainly, definitions of racism vary, but by my definition, ""white pride"" qualifies.—The preceding unsigned comment was added by .

<user_id=Sunray>
Ah, but context is everything.  No doubt she is a proud citizen of the British Empire.  However, she is a realist and is well-informed about who is behind the drug trade:
... Dr. Erwin C. Ruth, head of the Narcotic division of the International Revenue Department of Boston... alleges that the opium and cocaine traffic is financed largely by interests in Germany and Great Britain...
Among the pedlars who are the agents of the Ring, the traffic is chiefly in the hands of Americans, Canadians, Chinese, Negroes, Russians and Italians, although the Assyrians and Greeks and running closely in the race.
Her style of writing often mocks people who are racist or imperialist:
It is claimed also, but with what truth we cannot say, that there is a well-defined propaganda among the aliens of color to bring about the degeneration of the white race.
Maybe, it isn't so, after all, the popular dictum which has something to do with a flag and a bulldog...
Here she is mocking British chauvinism, but you have to read the full context to get it.  If one were to just refer to the first sentence, it would seem that she was indeed a racist.

<user_id=Themightyquill>
That's what I said. She's '''not''' blaming other races for the ""degeneration"" of the ""white race,"" but she '''is''' concerned about the decline of the ""white race."" And she suggests limiting immigration to help save the ""white race."" I don't think it's a simplistic, knee-jerk racism, but the fact that she continously couches her arguments in racial terms, in my opinion, makes her racist. We may just have to disagree on this.

<user_id=Sunray>
Calling her a racist is arguable and would constitue original research unless one could quote from a reliable source.  What is not dealt with (certainly in this article, but generally) is Canada's history of ''orientalism'' and racism in the first half of the twentieth century.  It is within that context that Murphy navigated.

<user_id=Themightyquill>
It may be arguable since racism is not (pardon the pun) a black and white issue, but it's not original research. I challenge you to find a modern piece of writing on Murphy that doesn't address her racism.
The penalties became much more severe in the early 1920s when a massive drug panic, closely tied to a renewed campaign for Chinese Exclusion, swept the nation. It started when the practiced social reformer Emily Murphy published a series of five sensationalist articles in Maclean's magazine. In them, she described the physical and moral deterioration of addicts and explained that drug use led white women to sleep with blacks and Asians, posing a serious threat to the white race. The first article was accompanied by a spooky drawing of a hand with long fingernails holding a Chinese tablet, a picture of a wizened Asian man with smoke coming out of his ears, and a photo of an Asian man smoking a pipe, making it clear that this was a Chinese menace.  Catherine Carstairs (assistant professor of history at UBC) on The Racist Roots of Canada's Drug Laws in ""Beaver"" a Canadian history journal.
When, in 1924, a Chinese cafe-owner in Regina challenged a law forbidding him to hire white women, much of Canada's liberal and progressive leadership seems to have gone mad with sexual frenzy. Chatelaine magazine, Alberta magistrate Emily Murphy, the local Council of Women and the Regina Women's Labour League all spouted racist paranoia about the perils of white women in the clutches of ""yellow"" men.    A review of Connie Backhouse's ""Colour-Coded, A Legal History of Racism in Canada 1900-1950."" in Herizons Journal
In The Black Candle and other writings, Emily Murphy expressed stereotypical and prejudiced views about various racial and ethnic groups.  Collections Canada

<user_id=193.6.218.9>
Emily Murphy has long been acknowledged as a racist  Adele Perry, Department of History University of Manitoba, in American Review of Canadian Studies; Autumn 2005

<user_id=Sunray>
Most of these quotes address racism in Canada and include references to ''Black Candle,'' and Murphy, but stop short of calling her ""racist"" (e.g. with statements like ""... spouted racist paranoia"").  I think I have shown that, although she does express racist notions in ''Black Candle,'' they are always set within a context that does not allow one to conclude that she is a ""racist"" ''per se.''
The last two quotes you give speak directly to the question.  The quote by Perry would be useable if she backs up her assertion with primary references of her own.  There an obvious tendency for people from a particular political persuasion to attempt to tar Murphy with the brush of racism (e.g. John Akpata, as outlined above). To say that she is an ""acknowledged racist"" is simply a throwaway line.  Acknowledged by whom?  Based on what research?  The quote from Collections Canada is probably useable in our article because it is demonstrably true. But it too needs the full context:
In The Black Candle and other writings, Emily Murphy expressed stereotypical and prejudiced views about various racial and ethnic groups. Like many Anglo -Protestants of her time, Emily Murphy believed that social problems of the era, such as poverty, prostitution, alcohol and drug abuse, were linked to the influx of immigrants into western Canada. These views informed some aspects of her social and legal reform work. Collections Canada

<user_id=Sunray>
BTW, it doesn't matter whether we hold the same point of view, but we (users) do need to agree on how we will address this in the article.

<user_id=Bobanny>
None of the arguments here that Murphy was not a racist are in the least bit convincing. I'm not on expert on her, but have read the Black Candle and other bits about her and am somewhat familiar with the context in which she is writing. Certainly, definitions do very, and the fact that the label ""racist"" is perjorative may make it seem that the subject is being insulted rather than described in an encyclopedic sort of way, i.e., not in a NPOV. There is, however, enough of a consensus in the world we live in that racism is a fairly clearly-defined phenomenon, and her racism does not detract from her role in the first wave feminist movement: saying she subscribed to a racist worldview is not the same as saying she was a jerk. Maybe she was a jerk, maybe she wasn't, but that's not the issue here. Some of the arguments here sound like the validity of the concept itself is in dispute. The controversial notion here, in light of established Canadian history, is that Murphy was NOT racist. For this reason, I think those making that claim are required to produce the evidence to the contrary, and I believe that would constitute original research.
Some reasons why I don't find these arguments credible:
-one does not have to be a simplistic ""knee jerk"" racist to be a racist.  Racists have gone to great pains to develop sophisticated analyses. Murphy was addressing an educated audience, and was trying to present a sophisticated worldview, which happened to be racist. No one's saying her racism was vulgar.
-context has little to do with it unless someone's views are being distorted by not accounting for the context in which they lived. Just because it was normal for educated, middle class women in positions of influence to subscribe to the view that, for example, the white race was threatened, does not mean that they were not racist (what exactly was posing the danger to the white race if not other races?). The term is ""presentism"" when you import a modern notion back to an era when that notion did not exist, and consequently misrepresent that era. That is not the case here, because the concept ""race"" did exist and people like Murphy subscribed to it and propagated it. It was also normal for Chinese and other non-whites to complain about racial discrimination, and occasionally, engage in acts of resistance.
-There is no question that Emily Murphy believed a) that race was a natural, biologically determined category, and b)that racial categories existed in a hierarchy and ought to be treated as such, i.e., white people were superior to non-whites, etc. This understanding is no longer accepted as valid by credible authorities on the subject - and is racist.
These issues are important because Emily Murphy was influential in the legal establishment, and therefore had a role in laws that people were forced to live under. The early war on drugs absolutely was racist and racially targeted people for discrimation. White women being lured into the drug scene by scary black men and shifty Chinamen was alarming to Murphy and others of her ilk. Perhaps she represented a step forward from the Asiatic Exclusion League because she did not feel the remedy was mob violence. In any case, the race section of the article seems more concerned with defending her from charges of racism than describing the significance of her views on race, and needs fixing. I'll give it a shot at some point when I have time, in the meantime, I welcome any good faith responses to my spiel. Cheers,

<user_id=Sunray>
Colonial society, as it existed in Western Canada at that time was indeed racist ''by today's standards.'' Why then would we call Murphy racist when we don't do the same for other public figures of that era from Alberta?  The answer is that unless we are a respected theorist, such as Edward Said or a researcher who has carefully analysed the question, we simply cannot make such an assertion here.  What I am saying is that we cannot state ''in an encyclopeda article'' that ""Murphy was a racist"" unless we have a citation from a reputable source who is basing his or her comment on analysis of proven facts rather than merely stating an opinion.  In short, we need a reliable source for any such statement.

<user_id=Bobanny>
The point here seems to be relevance; that the point of agreement that a consensus could be arrived at here is that her racism in itself is not relevant and not the reason she deserves an encyclopedic entry. But nor should it be clouded over, which is what the Cashman quote does now. He claims to be making the point that her racism does not negate her positive accomplishments. It's used as a red herring in this context, but is nonetheless true, as is the reverse: her positive accomplishments should not negate her racism.
My suggestion is, and I'm willing to give it a shot, is to edit this so that it neither states ""Emily Murphy was a racist,"" nor, like it does now, defend her against charges of racism, that we shouldn't ""make fun of her"" because she is a racist or judge her as racist. That's the problem with this section for me, and what makes it non-encyclopedic and non-NPOV. If the debate over her racism is to be kept, it should be described rather than argued, as it is now. Frankly, I don't see the need to include the debate at all and that instead the article should stick to Murphy, not focus on us and our debates.  I can't do it right now, but I'll put it on my to do list, and will try and be as precise and descriptive as I can and stick close to the evidence (and not be offended if its gets reverted).

<user_id=Sunray>
That makes sense to me and I will support any efforts to make this article more NPOV.

<user_id=Bobanny>
I redid the section on race; the rest of this article still needs cleaning up though. After reading up on Murphy, the final product is different from what I stated I would do. I did try and represent the different camps in a balanced way, and tried to account for comments here as well as academic and non-academic views, which is tricky. Hopefully its more nuanced than than it is muddled. NPOV could still be questioned here, but probably always could with such a controversial subject. There is but a fine line separating editing from censorship. Go nuts if this section still needs tweaking to make it NPOV.

<user_id=Sunray>
You have done this article a great service, IMO, by covering the topic in a fair and balanced manner.  I will do some editing, but I think you have achieved NPOV by presenting the various sides of the argument and backing them up with appropriate references. Nice work!

<user_id=Themightyquill>
Yep, I'm quite impressed Bobanny. Good work.

6. <user_id=Bobanny> enters the discussion, providing a more detailed analysis of the concept of racism and arguing that Murphy's views do indeed fit within the definition of racism. The user also suggests that the article should describe the significance of Murphy's views on race rather than defending her against charges of racism.

7. <user_id=Sunray> agrees that the article should be neutral and not make unsupported assertions about Murphy's character.

8. <user_id=Bobanny> revises the section on race in the article, aiming to represent different perspectives in a balanced way and to adhere to a neutral point of view.

Map

<user_id=C mon>
I dispute the accuracy of the map and with that the article. West Friesland is said to be a historic region, which existed during the 1100s till 1300s. How can the Anna Paulowna, Wieringermeer, Beemster or Zijpe be part of this? They are polders which were created during the 1500s till 1900s! At the time the region supposedly existed, they did not. So I suppose this map has to go, and the list of municipalities has to be more precise.

<user_id=Dolfy~enwiki>
The map shows where the region lays today, and what municipalities fall under it, maybe the say it more clearly. Also the region existed as state even in the time of United Provinces... So some of the polders already where made... Also around year 1000/1050 most of the area was land later on became water/see.. Some parts of that land are still water...

<user_id=C mon>
I would like to see a reliable academic source on the fact that this was supposedly one of the seven provinces at the time of the republic. But anyway It is quite anachronistic to list the municipalities that are currently part of region that is so old, even when some of these municipalities became land then water etc. Maybe a historical map would be the best way to show what the region is, because the current version is riddled in contradiction.

<user_id=Dolfy~enwiki>
If you read the dutch versions (of Holland, staten van Holland en West-Friesland, Geschiedenis van West-Friesland), you can do that if you with Babel Fish if can not read Dutch, you see that State of Holland was infact the State of Holland and Westfriesland, the province was also divided in two states, Holland and Westfriesland. It was Napoleon who changed this in other departments (Amstelland en Maasland)...
ps: also see links like usgennet.org en napoleon-serie.org and many more links via google.com
About the map; Even a histrorical map is riddled in contradiction, why?; simple, the geologic area changed a whole bit between 900 and 1800 (not a centery it was the same), so unless you make tens of maps a current one is more usefull, ofcourse stated that is a current one.

<user_id=C mon>
You wrote most of the West Friesland article, it was created so the real west-friesland article could be separated from this 'historic westfriesland. Furthermore, your academic proof is not very convincing: an article about The History of New York State (relevance?) and an article which is not written by a specialist on historical political geography, but by a specialist of military history, and a google search. Furthermore, the problem with the map and the list of municipalities, is that it is anarchronistic that municipalities that did not exist and land that did not exist is supposed to be part of West Friesland. One historic map, would be much more convincing than trying to use a contemporary map to show that land that does not exist anymore was part of west-friesland.

<user_id=Dolfy~enwiki>
You're now just saying I don't like what you typed so i dismiss everything.. Okay than this discussion is over..

<user_id=C mon>
I'm sorry my previous edit appeared as a personal attack, it was not intended that way, as on other pages, I am merely asking for sources on the existence of West Friesland as a separate state.

<user_id=C mon>
I don't know what to do with your conclusion ""the discussion is over"". It's not over, the articles accuracy is still disputed. I propose we seek some sort of dispute resolution.

<user_id=C mon>
I still dispute the accuracy of this article, especially the list of municipalities and image, so I'm removing them, making the article no longer disputed.

<user_id=Dolfy~enwiki>
Fine for you, not for the article, the list is for given the article a bit of body and idea off the area. Almost all the land, apart from big area of Wieringenmeer and bits of Anna Paulowna where already there when it was divide in the provides North and South-Holland.

<user_id=Dolfy~enwiki>
I made some ajudments on the text, hopefully gives better idea/look on why the list very useful and informational.

<user_id=C mon>
I would like to warn not to make this conflict personal. I was born and raised in West-Friesland. On a more constructive note: on the Dutch wikipedia a historic map was submitted. I find that very interesting because one really show where the region was, instead of giving an approximation. I want to resolve this dispute. The first step in such a proces is a request for comment, asking for a third opinion, because we have entered in an interesting ""welles/nietes"". Do you agree to submitting to this?

<user_id=Dolfy~enwiki>
Then why not use that one, if you think that's better? If you just sugged that, then I would just already said oke, fine. ps that map is also just a peak on a time of how the area looked, not a fixid look of the area geographicly offcourse..

<user_id=Dolfy~enwiki>
Map placed, hopefully better this way..

<user_id=C mon>
This map is not the best map possible, because it overlaps and looks too 'experimental' for encylcopedia. The list of municipalities still remains. It does not happen in other articles and the only reason you give for it is: It gives the article body. why not add useful information about the region? The map works much better to give an impression of the area, since on this english language encyclopedia no-one knows where the regions are.

<user_id=Dolfy~enwiki>
The list is very usefull information, because it gives refrences to where this region lays and which areas/city/town felled or fall under it . Especially considering the fact there are more than one areas named like this. And I garranty you that not one map can and will be usefull if you don't overlap or show them all, but one like this one or the other one gives the user an good idea of the area and where it lays. But that point I already made. Both maps used are public, see also West-Frise.jpg on the dutch Wikipedia, which was used as the overlap...

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User C mon's initial argument is about the historical accuracy of the map and the list of municipalities included in the article about West Friesland. They point out that some of the municipalities listed did not exist during the time period the article is supposed to cover, which is a valid concern for historical accuracy.

2. User Dolfy~enwiki responds by explaining that the map is meant to show the current geographical location of the region and the municipalities that are part of it today. They also mention that the region's geography has changed significantly over time, which could justify the use of a current map. This is a reasonable point, as it acknowledges the dynamic nature of geographical regions.

3. User C mon requests academic sources to support the claims made in the article, which is a standard practice for ensuring the reliability of information on Wikipedia. They also suggest that a historical map would be more appropriate for illustrating the region as it was during the historical period in question.

4. User Dolfy~enwiki provides some references but does not directly address the request for academic sources specific to the historical political geography of West Friesland. They also argue that even historical maps can be contradictory due to the changing geography, which is a fair point but does not directly address the issue of anachronism raised by User C mon.

5. User C mon proposes seeking dispute resolution, which is a constructive approach to resolving the disagreement. They also remove the disputed content to reflect the ongoing discussion, which is a proactive step.

6. User Dolfy~enwiki adjusts the text to better explain the use of the list of municipalities, which shows a willingness to compromise and improve the article.

7. User C mon suggests using a historic map from the Dutch Wikipedia and seeks to resolve the dispute amicably, which is a positive move towards consensus.

8. User Dolfy~enwiki agrees to place the map suggested by User C mon, which is a cooperative gesture.

9. User C mon still has concerns about the map's appearance and the list of municipalities, preferring to add more useful information about the region instead.

10. User Dolfy~enwiki defends the inclusion of the list as it provides context for the region's location and relevance, which is a valid point for readers unfamiliar with the area.

Overall, both users present arguments with varying degrees of validity. User C mon focuses on historical accuracy and the relevance of the content to the time period discussed, while User Dolfy~enwiki emphasizes the usefulness of current geographical information and the challenges of representing a region with a changing landscape. Both users show a willingness to engage in discussion and seek resolution, although there are moments of tension. The discussion includes constructive suggestions, requests for sources, and attempts to find common ground.

Maintenance tags

<user_id=N419BH>
The entire article needs work mainly because it does not have reliable, third party sources and it reads like a fansite/advertisement. For example, the second sentence:
The game is free to play, with no monthly fee,[4] no premium upgrades, no micro-payments, and no advertising on the site or in game.[5][6][7][8]
This basically advertises the game's free nature. Simply stating ""The game is free to play and is supported by donations,"" with a single source from a third-party publication, is sufficient to convey the point.
There are numerous other examples throughout the article. Feel free to make changes to address the issues.

<user_id=Xyz231>
That's what the sources report, and the reality. How can a fact be seen as advertizing?

<user_id=Xyz231>
The difference between games that are just free to play and PlaneShift is enormous. The majority of the game are flagged as ""free"" but then ask you to pay in plenty of ways. That's a major different from PlaneShift to other games.

<user_id=N419BH>
Let me try it this way. Think in terms of ""What are the most important points about this game?"" As someone who's never played it or any other MMO, my personal opinion is I want to know it's free and I want to know it doesn't have advertising. Since it's not both of those I'd like to know exactly how it pays for servers. However, I don't want to know it's free (no monthly fee), free (no premium upgrades), free (no mirco-payments), and free of advertising. Miscellaneous details do not help me understand what the game is about. Main points do. I've personally read the article several times and frankly I have no idea what the game is about. Hence the article requires cleanup because it's heavy on detail and short on main points. We're not saying the article is bad and should be deleted. We're saying these are specific issues that need to be addressed by people who know (that's you) so the article itself is better and easier to read.

<user_id=SpigotMap>
Keep in mind as well, this is an encyclopedia. Things that are sensationally important to you might tip the scales of neutrality or verifiability. The article needs serious copy-editing and formatting, which I've been working on. You should focus on writing verifiable claims and finding sources and I can take care of formatting it for you and making sure it's neutral.

<user_id=Xyz231>
That's very reasonable. I tried to compile a list of elements which were missing in my point of view. What you think are the ones you miss to understand the game? If you point them out, I will add them.

<user_id=N419BH>
One example is your recent edit to the character creator section. You added a source (good). However, the major issue with that section is a casual reader does not care what the names of the individual races are. There is currently no mention of exactly what is special about character development. The first part says it's good, the second part says all the details. There's no summary. As an additional bit of advice, try reading the article from the perspective of someone ""out of universe"". You've played the game and know a lot about it, so you're ""in universe"". It makes sense to you. The majority of the specific details are irrelevant to me because I have no context to base them on.

<user_id=Xyz231>
The notability and secondary sources are totally fine. There are plenty of notable sources including gaming magazines and books, more than any other gaming article on wikipedia, so stop being a pain on this point. The claims of people continuing to add the notability tag are not reasonable.

They are fine according to you. They are not fine according to WP:VERIFY or WP:RS. Read through the AfD again, there were plenty of reasons why they are not fine. The tags are here to help people edit the article, adding them is not vandalism and edit warring over them is not smart. You do not own this article.

I never seen a game article in wikipedia with so many sources really. So stop claiming the impossible.

<user_id=Woodroar>
There's a difference between ""sources"" and ""reliable, third-party (independent), published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy"" as Wikipedia requires. In short, we're looking for ''quality'', not ''quantity''. I'm trying to AGF here but it seems to me like you're being unnecessarily obtuse and combative on this point. Some of these sources are fine, I think we all agree on that, but some of them are outright poor sources and material based on poor sources isn't acceptable. You may want to read the WikiProject Video games guide to sources for a better idea of which sources we as a community value and those which we don't.
I will also again ask that you refrain from removing maintenance tags that ''multiple'' editors feel are necessary. We know that you don't agree with them, but quite honestly it's not ''your'' article. Removing these tags and characterizing our edits as ""vandalism"" is damaging to the progress of this article and the project as a whole. I feel like every edit needs to be run by you first, which is the definition of WP:OWN.

<user_id=Xyz231>
I do my best to improve the article, and seeing people just sticking banners is not encouraging. I remind you that the editor that is adding the tags (SpigotMap) has explicitly said he ""hates"" PlaneShift http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATuxide&action;=historysubmit&diff;=161766647&oldid;=159712023 and from the information provided by multiple people has been a troll for long time in PlaneShift.

I'm not interested anyway too much in going against him, I just want to be able to improve this article without a constant drumbeat of vandalism on it.

I think  provided some excellent, constructive criticism here. We should all try to point out some specific areas that can be reworded. I'll come back tomorrow and try to reword some. This is exactly what the NPOV tag is for. So hopefully we can keep it this time, talk this out, and end up with an actual article.

Well of course, but to be honest: Wikipedia is built on consensus, so suck it up.  

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User N419BH raises concerns about the article's neutrality and verifiability, pointing out that the article reads like an advertisement and lacks reliable, third-party sources. This user provides constructive criticism, suggesting a more concise way to convey the game's free nature and emphasizing the importance of focusing on the main points rather than excessive detail. The argument is well-reasoned and focuses on improving the article's quality in line with Wikipedia's guidelines.

2. User Xyz231 defends the current state of the article, arguing that the facts presented are not advertising but simply reality. This user emphasizes the uniqueness of the game's free-to-play model. While the user's passion for the subject is evident, the argument does not fully address the concerns about neutrality and the need for reliable sourcing.

3. User SpigotMap offers to help with formatting and maintaining neutrality, suggesting a collaborative approach to improving the article. This user's argument is constructive and focuses on adhering to Wikipedia's standards.

4. User Xyz231 responds to the request for clarification on what is missing in the article by asking for specific points that need to be added. This shows a willingness to improve the article but also a lack of understanding of the core issue raised by N419BH, which is the need for a more general summary rather than detailed in-universe information.

5. User Xyz231 argues that the notability and secondary sources are sufficient, listing numerous sources. However, this user seems to conflate the quantity of sources with their quality, which is a point of contention in the discussion.

6. User Woodroar points out the difference between mere sources and reliable, third-party sources as required by Wikipedia. This user's argument is informative and emphasizes the importance of source quality over quantity, aligning with Wikipedia's guidelines.

7. User Xyz231 expresses frustration with the addition of maintenance tags and accuses another editor of bias against the game. This argument is more emotional and less focused on the content quality, and it introduces an ad hominem element to the discussion.

8. User Spacexplosion acknowledges the constructive criticism provided by N419BH and suggests a collaborative approach to rewording the article. This user's argument is solution-oriented and aims to improve the discussion and article quality.

9. User JayC reminds everyone that Wikipedia operates on consensus, implying that personal opinions should be set aside in favor of collaborative decision-making. This argument is a reminder of Wikipedia's foundational principles and encourages a resolution based on consensus.

Overall, the discussion includes a mix of constructive criticism, attempts at collaboration, and some defensiveness. While there are strong arguments for improving the article's neutrality and adherence to Wikipedia's standards, there are also instances where arguments are less focused on content quality and more on defending the current state of the article or personal feelings about the subject.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Molestation allegations

<user_id=Bali88>
You can't just omit any reference to the molestation allegations. For one thing, people know they were alleged and people believe there is evidence based on rumors they've heard. Explaining the nature of the allegations, how it played out in court, and ''why'' the allegations were rejected by the supreme court is important to help those people understand the nature of these things. Without that section, people will continue to believe that there actually is credible evidence. Those allegations are an integral part of this case and its important for the audience to understand how this all played out and the prosecutorial misconduct that went into it.

<user_id=Overagainst>
You can't just omit any reference to the molestation allegations. I did no such thing in my edit. The allegation that Carr had molested his 5 year old daughter was mentioned thrice in my edit. As you can see here, it's in the lede (mentioned in the full proper context of the  second conviction being overturned because the prosecution told the jury Carr molested his daughter Jill  their opening statement but brought forward no evidence to support their accusation. Then the molestation is mentioned in the second trial section, and finally in the prosecutorial misconduct section.
Currently there is a Molestation allegations section that  begins '''""The molestation allegations remain controversial and there is little consensus as to the cause of Jill's injuries""''' and ends '''""The nature and the cause of Jill's injuries remain a mystery, as well does the time frame in which they happened. Camm denies ever abusing his daughter and has never been charged with any molestation-related offense.[69]""''' Not our job to discuss evidence in that way. Even if he was not a living person, WP:ALIVE, that phasing is weight and not NPOV. You cannot discuss such an accusation in the way the current section is doing with a whole section, about a living person, and then end by saying 'it's a mystery, he denies it and hasn't been charged with it.'

<user_id=Bali88>
Also, what evidence feels non-notable to you? I left out the vast majority of the evidence and I feel like the evidence included was pretty crucial to the case.

<user_id=Bali88>
So you feel like it's not neutral the way it's written? I feel like this is the current status of things. There was nothing linking it to Camm, but the supreme court didn't rule that it wasn't a sexual assault and Boney's DNA is on Jill's clothing above the area. What wording specifically feels biased to you?

<user_id=Overagainst>
Please indent your comments.  I have already given my reasons and supplied quotes in bold of the beginning and end of the section, which I think is showing an unacceptable tone and content throughout, especially for a allegation of this type about a living person. You saying  ""There was nothing linking it to Camm, but the supreme court didn't rule that it wasn't a sexual assault""  is an odd way to look at it and not in line with my understanding of BLP policy. I think you need much better reasons, and support from some cited WP guidance on BLPs for the article remaining as it is.

<user_id=Bali88>
you're going to have to be clearer on how exactly this violates BLP. I see nothing contentious about the section whatsoever.

<user_id=Overagainst>
Please cite where WP:ALIVE in yor opinion says you can use the kind of language I bolded above. I see that John from Idegon, Arthur goes shopping and others have tried to explain the problems with the page, to little avail. I'll give you time to think over what I have been saying, and re read  what others have been saying.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Bali88 is concerned that omitting the molestation allegations from the article would lead to misinformation and believes that explaining the nature of the allegations and their legal outcomes is important for clarity and understanding.

2. User Overagainst argues that they did not omit the allegations but mentioned them appropriately in the context of the article. They believe that the current section on molestation allegations is not neutral and does not comply with Wikipedia's policy on biographies of living persons (BLP), specifically pointing out the tone and content as problematic.

3. User Bali88 asks for clarification on what evidence is considered non-notable and expresses their view that the evidence included is crucial to the case.

4. User Bali88 also questions the neutrality of the wording and seeks to understand which part of the text is biased, offering their interpretation of the Supreme Court's ruling and the evidence.

5. User Overagainst insists on the importance of adhering to BLP policy and suggests that the language used in the section is not acceptable for an allegation about a living person. They also reference other users who have pointed out issues with the page.

6. User Bali88 requests a clearer explanation of how the section violates BLP policy, stating that they see nothing contentious about it.

7. User Overagainst asks for a citation from the BLP policy that would support the language used in the section and suggests that User Bali88 re-read the policy and consider the feedback from other users.

Evaluation of Arguments:

- User Bali88 presents a valid concern about the potential for misinformation if the allegations are not included. They also show a willingness to discuss the evidence and its relevance to the case.
- User Overagainst provides a clear rationale for their edits, focusing on Wikipedia's BLP policy and the need for a neutral tone. They also reference feedback from other users, which shows an awareness of the community's perspective.
- Both users are engaged in the discussion, but there is a lack of direct citation from Wikipedia's BLP policy to support their arguments. User Overagainst requests such citations but does not provide them themselves.
- The discussion could benefit from more specific examples of problematic language and a clearer explanation of BLP policy from User Overagainst.
- User Bali88 could also provide a more detailed justification for why the section does not violate BLP policy, rather than simply stating that they see nothing contentious.

Overall, the discussion shows engagement and a level of detail that is constructive, but it lacks specific policy citations and examples that would strengthen the arguments. The participants are focused on the content and its implications, which is positive, but the discussion could be improved with more direct references to Wikipedia's guidelines and a more thorough analysis of the language used.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Balance

<user_id=BigK HeX>
Many agree with your observations (especially #2).  There is an small army of editors who rather prefer a presentation of the information that keeps the current blatant ideological writing.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
'However there seems to be a strong editorial position in the article which seeks to argue that such horror is an inevitable consequence of Communism.'' - Where does that seem to be such an editorial position? Can you point it out so it can be rectified?

<user_id=OpenFuture>
'In terms of balance capitalism has killed at least as many if not more people by neglect (and sometimes deliberately) and there are cases of near genocide (Australian Aboriginals for one) arising from indifference.'' - Then it's also the fault of trees, because they are also indifferent to the suffering of Aboriginals. And rocks. And Fishes. I look forward to ""Mass killings caused by the indifference of Crustaceans"". -)

<user_id=Snowded>
Section 3.1 needs to be cut back to a paragraph with citations, at the moment its a political list

<user_id=Snowded>
At the risk of giving a 101 lecture in ethics, a tree can not be held responsible if someone is mugged under its boughs, but we would take a very different view of a human being simply stood there and watched it happen. As to crustaceans, well hiding in shells to escape reality comes to mind.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
Section 3.1 now outlines several different scholarly opinions on the subject. Cutting it down to one paragraph with citations is impossible while preserving NPOV and not giving one or a few particular scholars WP:UNDUE weight. Also I don't see what the problem is with that section from the issues you stated above. That section doesn't have any ""editorial position"". It just outlines available scholars view of things. If you think there is a scholar who is missing or shouldn't be in there, that would make sense, but this request doesn't. I thought your problem was with the article in general. Now it seems your problem with the article is that you don't like what it says. Well, that can't be helped.
And at the risk of giving a 101 lecture in economics, capitalism is not a person.

<user_id=Snowded>
They are all making very similar points, the long list is an attempt to give undue weight to a particular explanation amongst several

<user_id=Snowded>
At the risk of a 101 lecture in systems and cognition (as well as ethics) the economic systems we adopt either as a result of upbringing or as a result of deliberate choice produce moral consequences

<user_id=OpenFuture>
Although a couple of the ideas are the same, most of them are actually quite different. They don't contradict each other, so they could be merged, but we can't do that, it would be WP:SYNTHESIS if you can find one reliable source that takes a look at the other research and summarizes it, then that would solve the problem. Claiming that it gives undue weight to one view because it includes many is kinda strange.

<user_id=Snowded>
The section concerned argues that it is the nature of communism which is the cause of the problem, it doesn't require every single variation of that to be listed with multiple quotes many (such as the Trotsky one) completely out of context.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
' it doesn't require every single variation of that to be listed '' - Yes, it does, as there is no tertiary sources summarizing this and coming up with a consensus view on what in the communist ideology that causes mass killings. If we were to change that and say ""Many scholars believe mass killings are caused by the nature of communist ideology"", that would be WP:SYN.
You seem to be saying that by listing every scholars view, the view that communism was responsable gets undue weight. This is clearly not true, because each scholar is given about the same place. When doing that, the opinion that the ideology is to blame clearly has more weight, but it's also clearly not *undue* since this in fact is the most common view amongst scholars. The problem here is simply that you don't like it. But Wikipedia doesn't care what you, I or any one else here likes and doesn't like.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
I do agree the Trotsky quote can go.

<user_id=Snowded>
Please try and address content issues.   Its not just listing multiple authors, but its also extensive quotes.  An encyclopedia summarises it does not list everything.  There may be a few strands in the thought that can be summarised with references to the authors.   Please advise your third party source which says this is the most common view

<user_id=OpenFuture>
'but its also extensive quotes.'' - So? They are all ""extensively"" quoted. That's not undue weight.
'There may be a few strands in the thought that can be summarised with references to the authors.'' - That would be WP:SYN.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
'Please advise your third party source which says this is the most common view'' - Again: If there was a tertiary source, *then* we could summarize. There isn't and hence we can't. Your objections are invalid. You are welcome with new objections if you have any, but the claim of undue weight is clearly false.

<user_id=Snowded>
OK so your comment that this was the majority view is not supported?  I think you are confused on WP:SYN but we are not going to get much further discussing it one to one here. If I get time in the next week I will draft a change.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
It is clearly the majority view, as you can see from the article. No, we don't have a tertiary source stating it. Is this somehow confusing for you? I think it's pointless to draft a change unless you understand why we are listing each scholar separately instead of making a WP:SYN out of it.

<user_id=Igny>
You are right in a sense that article clearly presents it as the majority view. But Showded is right saying that the article is unbalanced by giving undue weight to a particular point of view. (  )

<user_id=The Four Deuces>
Since the article implies that there is a connection between Communism and mass killings we should explain what connection is made by by Furet, Nolte and Courtois.  The Communists killed over one hundred million people, more than the Nazis and were therefore a greater evil.  The killing of kulaks and cossak was not different from killing Jews.  The death of a Ukranian Kulak child deliberately starved by the policies of Stalinism is equal to the death of a Jewish child in the Warsaw ghetto deliberately starved by Nazis.  Under French law both crimes would have been treated the same.  The international Jewish community bears responsibility for diminishing discussion of Communist murders while giving undue attention to the crimes of Nazis.  Auschwitz was after all modelled on the gulags.  Considering the severe threat posed by Communism, the actions of Nazi Germany at least had a rational basis.

<user_id=Collect>
Um  the article '''states''' that mass killings have occurred under oommunist regimes. It makes no implications otherwise, except as stated in reliable sources.   Discourses on other killings do not actually benefit this talk page one whit.  As for your venture into what may be the issue of Holocaust denial - I find that quite regrettable.

<user_id=The Four Deuces>
I am, as I stated, indicating the views of Furet, Nolte and Courtois.  Neither I nor they said anything about Holocaust denial.  My point is that if we are to use the ''Black Book'' as a source then the article should reflect what it says.

<user_id=DarknessShines2>
No we should not, it is being used as a source for communist atrocities, not nazi ones. There is no need at all to mention nazi`s in this article unless to say communists were worse of course

<user_id=The Four Deuces>
That was the point made, that Communism is worse than Nazism, that certain people including Communists, do not want us to know this, and if we use the ''Black Book'' as a reliable source, then we should include this.

<user_id=DarknessShines2>
Curious, not so long ago you were arguing against the BBOC as a source, now you want to use it? Why the change of heart? And what is the proposed text and were shall it be going?

<user_id=The Four Deuces>
No it is not a reliable source.  However as I have said before you decided to join this conversation, the views in the ''Black Book'' and similar sources could be presented provided reliable sources were used.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
Mark: Do *not* chastise people for changing their mind when they are wrong. It's a good thing.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
That is neither what I said, nor correct. I did not say that the article presents it as the majority view. I said that it clearly *is* the majority view. The article however does not present it as such, and that's because it can not do that as that would be WP:SYN unless we have a tertiary source, which we don't. Your argumentless repetition is just WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT. I have explained above why it presents *all* views of *all* notable scholars in the topic. This is obviously *not* giving undue weight to any view. If you still think giving equal weight to all scholars gives undue weight to any of them, please explain how. But stop just repeating that it's undue weight. You do need to explain *how*, otherwise your argumentation is just tendentious editing, with the intention of disrupting the constructive discussion.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
'we should explain what connection is made by by Furet, Nolte and Courtois'' - Sure. Can you explain how this is NOT done today when it comes to Courtois? Do you have the sources you are referring to with Furet and Nolte? Can you maybe summarize their views as expressed in WP:RS?

<user_id=Snowded>
if your argument was correct then every wikipedia article would be nothing but long lists of statements by different scholars.  This is an encyclopedia not a list of references and as you have admitted you have no third party source to establish that the section concerned is a dominant source.  The balance of the article presents it as dominant and has far too many direct quotations - you need to go read the manual of style.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
'as you have admitted you have no third party source to establish that the section concerned is a dominant source'' - That sentence makes no sense. An section is not a source. Of course the section is not a source.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
'The balance of the article presents it as dominant'' - What is ""it""? It presents all views available from reliable sources. It never claims any of these views is a dominant view.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
'if your argument was correct then every wikipedia article would be nothing but long lists of statements by different scholars.'' - Why would that be? That doesn't follow.

<user_id=Snowded>
OK, I get the message, you are closed to argument on this one.  I'll draft an alternative and check to policy then we can see where we go with it.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
Explaining why an argument is wrong is not being closed to argument.

<user_id=The Four Deuces>
Courtois is only briefly mentioned in the article.  Despite numerous citations to the ''Black Book'' that he edited they are used to support facts from articles in the book rather than to support Courtois' views.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
Right, the citations are used to support facts, and not opinions, except under Section 3, Proposed causes, which is the section that deals with scholars opinions on that subject. Can you now please explain exactly what you find is wrong with this? Do you have the sources you are referring to with Furet and Nolte? Can you maybe summarize their views as expressed in WP:RS? Can you please post here just what it is from the two sources (Brinks and Wheatcroft) that you want included in the article as you were asked earlier?

<user_id=BigK HeX>
OpenFuture: Do *not* put words into people's mouths about them people ""changing their minds"" in order to claim another one of your false ""victories.""  It's a bad thing.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
Good thing I didn't then. Maybe you should concentrate more on constructive debate relating to the article instead of discussing other editors?

<user_id=C.J. Griffin>
'Numerous'' citations??? I count only 17 different citations (33abc, 34, 35, 55, 67, 75, 121abc, 125, 151ab) where the BBOC is the source out of over 165. Furet and Nolte are irrelevant as they aren't even cited in the article.

",0,"The discussion revolves around the balance and representation of views in an article related to mass killings under communist regimes. The main points of contention are whether the article gives undue weight to a particular viewpoint that mass killings are an inevitable consequence of communism, and whether the article should summarize scholars' views or list them extensively.

1. **Argument for balance and summarization**: User Snowded argues that the article should not list every single variation of the view that communism inherently causes mass killings. They suggest that an encyclopedia should summarize rather than list extensive quotes, which they believe gives undue weight to a particular explanation.

2. **Argument against synthesis**: User OpenFuture counters that summarizing different scholarly opinions into a few strands would constitute original research or synthesis, which is against Wikipedia's policies. They argue that the article does not present any view as dominant and that all notable scholars' views are given equal weight.

3. **Argument for inclusion of tertiary sources**: Snowded requests a third-party source to establish that the view presented is the most common among scholars, which OpenFuture admits is lacking. OpenFuture maintains that without a tertiary source, they cannot summarize and must list each scholar separately.

4. **Argument about the relevance of certain sources**: The Four Deuces suggests that if the ""Black Book"" is used as a source, the article should reflect its views, including the comparison of communism to Nazism. This is met with resistance from other users who argue that the article should focus on communist atrocities without delving into comparisons with Nazism.

5. **Argument about the representation of sources**: C.J. Griffin points out that the ""Black Book"" is not overly cited in the article, countering the claim that it is given undue weight.

The quality of the discussion is mixed. On one hand, there are valid points about the need for balance and the avoidance of original research. On the other hand, there are moments where the discussion devolves into less constructive territory, with accusations of putting words in people's mouths and a lack of focus on the content issue at hand.

The arguments presented by Snowded about balance and the need for summarization are coherent and relevant to the goal of an encyclopedia. OpenFuture's insistence on avoiding synthesis is also a valid point, although it may be interpreted as inflexible by others in the discussion. The Four Deuces introduces a controversial comparison that shifts the focus away from the main issue, which detracts from the overall quality of the discussion.

Overall, the discussion shows an engagement with Wikipedia's policies and a struggle to find the right balance between representing all views and avoiding undue weight. However, the lack of consensus and occasional lapses into less productive exchanges lower the quality of the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5.",6.5

Neutrality

<user_id=Terra Novus>
The title of this article is unneutral and should be revised to something like Criticism of Climate Change..

<user_id=Terra Novus>
I have moved the article to a more neutral sounding title, and I have also tagged it for neutrality...

<user_id=Hans Adler>
That was an obviously controversial move. Such moves must be discussed ''before'' they are done. See WP:RM. Since this is a generally very contentious area I will immediately escalate this to WP:ANI so that an admin can revert your move before you start a discussion – if you still feel like it, that is.

<user_id=Terra Novus>
I guess I didn't realize it was so controversial to adhere to WP:NPOV! Why the need to keep this article from being improved productively? Right now it seems that editors from both sides of the topic are locked out of the picture and that the article is written from a largely one-sided view.

<user_id=Emptyviewers>
I strongly agree with the user above. The very mention that it is referred to as ""denial"" means that they are refusing to admit to it. There are plenty of better names of it that are far more neutral.

<user_id=Hans Adler>
Neutrality isn't about ""balancing"" in the way incompetent or lazy journalists do – representing everything in the form of a dispute that cannot actually be decided on rational grounds. (Typical example: ""Most people find torture morally repugnant. However, according to Professor John Doe, a former teacher at the School of the Americas, properly conducted torture does not pose a serious threat to the subject's physical constitution and is often necessary to..."") One thing that Wikipedia doesn't do is misrepresent fringe claims as if they had more credibility than they do. Anyone who denies the well-established connection between smoking and cancer is a denialist. Global warming is a very similar situation in more than one respect. The article is about the manufactured global warming denialism, not the tiny number of genuine researchers who legitimately dissent from the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming. The latter category is hardly in danger of being underrepresented, given how much they are being pushed into the news by PR companies and their fronts. And they do have more than enough weight in Wikipedia.

<user_id=Emptyviewers>
Well then maybe this page should be deleted and instead make a page about the argument about the causes and effects of global warming and how many people don't feel that it is a major issue and that it's natural.

<user_id=Sailsbystars>
You mean like the article on the Global warming controversy?  This particular article is about the well-documented corporate-funded attack campaign on the science behind global warming, which is a separate issue.

<user_id=DGaw>
With all due respect, it does appear to me that this article is written from a particular point of viewspecifically one that is critical of what Sailsbystars calls the ""well-documented corporate-funded attack campaign on the science behind global warming."" Are there others here who disagree, and feel that the article is not written to be critical of the ""denialist"" position?

<user_id=VsevolodKrolikov>
Dgaw, I think you're conflating NPOV with ""giving equal weight"". Wikipedia tries to represent the balance of reliable sources. The view that there is global warming and that it is being caused by human activity is overwhelmingly supported by the sources that Wikipedia uses in matters of science. The view that there is a campaign (or movement) to undermine public trust in this research for non-scientific (ideological, commercial) reasons has, in comparison to any other view (for example, that people called derogatorily ""denialists"" have correctly identified a conspiracy in the scientific community to defraud), overwhelming representation in what Wikipedia would consider the best sources (academic books and articles). This cannot be disputed, and Wikipedia should not pretend otherwise. While the article should have dissenting voices such as can be represented in Wikipedia, it would not be NPOV to present both sides as equal. I am keen, as my previous edits to this talkpage show, for the article not explicitly to take sides, and to leave the door open that the view you mention is challenged by some people. However, that one side has overwhelming support in the scholarly community is not something that Wikipedia editors are making up through prejudice. Like it or not, global warming denialism qualifies, because so few genuine scientists support it, as fringe science, and campaigns by well-funded political organisations to promote it constitute a genuine phenomenon that has attracted respectable academic analytical attention.

<user_id=Jaymax>
Hi VsevolodKrolikov; I agree that neutrality does not equal ""giving equal weight"", and I'm not saying the article's non-neutrality is related to that. Neutrality require, however, that all articles be written as far as possible without bias.  As written, this article does not just describe the points of view of those who are party to the debate, it speaks with the voice of one side. That's its problem.
Your comments about the scientific perspective on global warming are fairly put, but I think somewhat beside the point, because this article is not about climate science, or whether or not global warming exists, but about the political debate surrounding it.
POV in topic context.  For example, is the article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus written from a particular point of view?  Absolutely it is, but not inappropriately. This article is about a campaign to influence belief away from the evidentiary basis.  Within the article topic context, the article is relatively neutral I think.  ‒

<user_id=DGaw>
Hi Jaymax, you make an interesting point. In fact, the article Resurrection_of_Jesus is ''not'' written from a particular point of view, as Wikipedia means that.  Quite the contrary, in fact, which is impressive considering how controversial religion is a subject.  The article has a neutral title, describes a belief in neutral language, and describes the details of that belief.  It states clearly that its describing a religious belief.  It doesn't take a position on whether the belief is correct.  It doesn't use language that is either critical or supportive of the belief.  It doesn't take positions on the possible motivations of those who hold the belief.  And it describes alternate views, also neutrally, and links out to more in depth articles on those beleifs.  It is, in short, a model for how this article should be, but so far isn't.

<user_id=Dmcq>
Global warming or Global warming controversy would be the appropriate analogues. This article is not about whether climate change is correct or not or is actually happening. A more appropriate one would be perhaps persecution of Christians where whether Christ had risen or not is really quite immaterial.

<user_id=DGaw>
I understand what you are saying, and I agree the subject matter is not analogous.  It was more the tone I was pointing out as worthy of emulation.  An article on the persecution of Christians would also need to be written in a neutral tone for inclusion here, of course.

<user_id=Hans Adler>
The current lead is not optimal, but this was not an improvement.

<user_id=DGaw>
Hi Hans.  I'm sorry you don't think so.  Why not?

<user_id=Hans Adler>
Because it implies doubt where no reasonable doubt exists on balance of the best available reliable sources.

<user_id=Dmcq>
I just had a look and there is an article with the exact title Persecution of Christians if you're interested in tone. I get the feeling though that some of the 'skeptics' around the place view scientists rather more like Thuggee and any means are justified in their suppression.

<user_id=Hans Adler>
That article is very contentious and has similar problems to this one. I wouldn't use it for a comparison.

<user_id=DGaw>
Hi Dmcq.  A few things.  1) What is infuding?  2) The second sentence doesn't say ""said to be associated"", it says ""has been associated"".  3) Even if it did say ""said to be associated"", that would address a different point than my edit, the point of which is this: as written, the first sentence is making an assertion about the motives of ""denialists"" instead of making it clear it is those who use the term are making the assertion.  That runs counter to the principle of neutrality, to which we are all subject: Wikipedia doesn't make assertions, it reports the assertions of others in as neutral a tone as possible.  If you have a better way of making the clarification, of course, that would be great too.

<user_id=DGaw>
In what way do you think it implies doubt?  As I read it, it doesn't: it simply makes clear who is making the assertion about the motives of the ""denialists.""

<user_id=VsevolodKrolikov>
DGaw, might I suggest that these exchanges you are having in this section are being somewhat superseded by the discussion about the lede below? Some of us are keen to focus the topic of the article not simply on people who prominently are known for not accepting the consensus on climate, but on the pattern of denial that emerges from people associated with conservative think tanks (that have often received substantial funding from fossil fuel industrial interests), which crucially ''has been identified by scholarly sources''. (As it stands, the lede certainly is unclear and potentially POV - it can be read to imply that all denial is for political or commercial gain.) So, for example, the phrase ""has been associated with"" becomes by definition correct, as it's that kind of opposition to climate change science that sources generally examine, not opposition everywhere at all times. In these sources, the difference between scientific scepticism and attempts to bypass or ape scientific procedures in the political goal of attacking AGW is made very clear. The lede as it stands does not make this distinction, and it's remiss that it does not. I recommend the Oreskes book (well, I'm halfway through it now, so that far at least) as being very well written and very clear about the issue - which is non-science based, politically motivated denialism, not the minority opinions of legitimate scientists. (It's available on kindle for a dollar cheaper than the hardback). By this, I don't mean that the article should presume Oreskes and the many other writers who say much the same are correct in their analyses, but at the very least it should be clear about what their case is, and what is beyond reasonable doubt (such as the strong association between prominent denialism and conservative institutes, and these conservative institutes' financial connection to fossil fuel companies.) Lumping all dissenters from the consensus as ""deniers"" is wrong, but it's also POV to describe all deniers as ""skeptics"", and POV to turn the uncontestable (such as Frederick Seitz's and S. Fred Singer's association with conservative institutes) into mere conjectures.

<user_id=Dmcq>
I haven't the foggiest what word I was thinking of when I wrote 'infuding'. I should take more care when writing my comments. The essential point though is that 'has been associated with' already says it is asserted by some people without fudging what the topic is about in the first place.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Neutrality and Title Change**: Terra Novus initiates the discussion by expressing concern over the neutrality of an article's title, suggesting a change to ""Criticism of Climate Change."" This is a valid point in striving for neutrality, but Hans Adler counters that such moves should be discussed before implementation, referencing Wikipedia's guidelines. Hans Adler's argument is procedurally sound and emphasizes the importance of consensus before making controversial changes.

2. **Controversial Nature of the Topic**: Hans Adler escalates the issue to an administrative level due to the contentious nature of the topic. This is a reasonable strategy to prevent edit wars and ensure that changes are made with oversight.

3. **Representation of Fringe Claims**: Hans Adler and VsevolodKrolikov argue that neutrality does not mean giving equal weight to fringe claims, and that the scientific consensus should be represented accordingly. This is a strong argument that aligns with Wikipedia's policy on due weight and verifiability.

4. **Article Focus and Scope**: Sailsbystars and Dmcq clarify that the article in question is about a specific campaign against the science of global warming, not the broader controversy or scientific debate. This is an important distinction that helps to focus the discussion on the article's content and purpose.

5. **Tone and Bias**: Jaymax and DGaw raise concerns about the article's tone, suggesting that it speaks with the voice of one side of the debate. They advocate for a more neutral presentation of information. This is a valid point that addresses the core principle of Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.

6. **Comparison with Other Articles**: DGaw uses the ""Resurrection of Jesus"" article as an example of neutrality, which is a good strategy to illustrate how controversial topics can be handled. However, Dmcq points out that the analogy is not perfect, as the topics are not directly comparable.

7. **Clarity and Implication**: DGaw and VsevolodKrolikov discuss the implications of certain phrases and how they might suggest doubt or bias. This is a nuanced debate that shows a deep understanding of language and its impact on perceived neutrality.

8. **Scholarly Sources and Weight**: VsevolodKrolikov emphasizes the importance of representing the balance of reliable scholarly sources, which is a key aspect of Wikipedia's verifiability and notability standards.

Overall, the participants in this discussion demonstrate a good understanding of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, particularly those related to neutrality, verifiability, and due weight. They engage in a substantive debate about the article's content, tone, and title, with most arguments being well-reasoned and relevant to the platform's standards. The discussion is coherent, with participants responding directly to each other's points and providing evidence or policy-based reasoning for their positions.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.0",8.0

Another example of cherrypicking quotes from sources, and not presenting all sides of what is presented in the very sources used:Chávez has a Twitter account with more than 720,000 followers as of August 2010, with about 2000 joining every day. Carroll, Rory. ""Hugo Chávez embraces Twitter to fight online 'conspiracy'."" guardian.co.uk 28 Apr 2010: n. pag. Web. 7 Aug 2010. . http://twitter.com/chavezcandanga Chávez's Twitter account has been described as a way for people to bypass bureaucracy and contact the president directly. There is a team of 200 people to sort through suggestions and comments sent via Twitter. Chávez has said Twitter is ""another mechanism for contact with the public, to evaluate many things and to help many people.""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/10/hugo-chavez-twitter-venezuela  If so much space (in a grossly deficient article) is to be given to the Twitter account, then by all means, please present what the source says, for example, about the alleged team of 200 people, and his previous attacks on Twitter.  This is typical of the issues that occur in this article, resulting in unbalance and undue.  And why on earth spend so much time on Twitter, when so much else is lacking from the article, without establishing the context of his use of Twitter?  Didn't someone recently delete text about Chavez's speaking style, and yet this very source speaks to that ?  When using reliable sources, pls don't cherrypick from them to present one side only. Why does unbalanced text like this, which does not fully reflect what the sources say, stay in the article unchallenged, while anything else is endlessly nitpicked?

<user_id=SandyGeorgia>
Twitter

<user_id=Jrtayloriv>
I agree  I don't think his twitter account is worthy of inclusion at all in this article, and even in an article about media in Venezuela, I would say that it only warrants a sentence or two.

<user_id=SandyGeorgia>
I think it *is* worthy of inclusion, when placed in the context of his views about using the internet to further his ""revolution"" there is context for his use of media and the internet, and multiple reliable sources speak to that, but here we have multiple sentences devoted to making him look good, without mentioning all sides of the issues.  Context!

<user_id=JoelWhy>
I'm fine with this, or having it removed completely. I mean, should we add how many Facebook friends he has?  Unless it's a record for a world leader or something, it's pure trivia.  But, if it's presented in context to his view on the Internet, etc, then it may make sense.
Also, I want to again point out that the Media section is a daughter section to the Human Rights section.  It needs to be moved elsewhere if it's not going to be solely about HR-related press issues.

<user_id=Jrtayloriv>
Personally, I don't think using Twitter to ""further his revolution"" and promote social change makes him ""look bad""  most major news organizations also use social networking sites to promote their ideology. Whatever you think of him, he would be a fool not to communicate about what is happening in Venezuela using any means available. So if anything, using the internet to communicate makes him look reasonable. Nor do I think that everything was presented to ""make him look good""  what made you feel this way? Please assume good faith on the part of editors  not everyone who doesn't include everything you would have included is some one-sided propagandist who is just out to ""take things out of context"" and ""make Chavez look good"". Maybe they were just trying to improve the article. But, anyhow, if you feel like it's worthy of inclusion, and as long as we stick to facts, I won't argue. But I do think it should be short, and I don't feel that editors should get to selectively remove anything that they feel is there to make him ""look good"", while ""balancing it out"" by replacing it with negative opinions from the corporate press. By the way, note how much space the White House has gotten discussing it's Facebook page, for instance (a single external link, which is about what I think this warrants) ... why is Chavez's twitter page so significant that it warrants a whole paragraph?

<user_id=The Four Deuces>
By all means remove anything with a pro-Chavez bias.  But do not use its presense to balance it with anti-Chavez bias.  Bias does not belong in the article.

<user_id=Jrtayloriv>
I agree  I don't think twitter or the new movie studio belong in this section. Just like we have a ""Foreign Policy"", ""Economics"", and ""Human rights"" section, perhaps it would be better to move this sort of think to a ""Culture"" section, and describe music, film, etc.

<user_id=SandyGeorgia>
If placed in context, the Twitter account is not trivia.  He has made numerous statements about using the internet to further his ""revolution"", while simultaneously trying to shut down or criticize others who do same (see the very sources given in that passage, as well as numerous others), and his use of/control of the media and the internet is an oft-mentioned in reliable sources part of his strategy this needs to be placed in the context, and the content added re: Twitter clearly cherrypicked from that source for the most favorable presentation.  On the other hand, I have NO idea why the movie house was added that is pure trivia, as far as relates to other reliable sources and due weight.  Why so much focus here on trivia, when no one bothers to make any attempt to balance foreign policy, human rights, economic policy, the lead, and so forth?  Priorities ...

<user_id=SandyGeorgia>
When *one* source (as in this example) presents both sides, the balance is already given in the source.  In this case, quotes were cherrypicked to present only one side, and context has not been given.  Chavez's use of/control of the media is context given in multiple reliable sources.

<user_id=Rd232>
cherrypicking implies dishonesty; please remember to assume good faith. People with different views will always see different things as important, and especially in haste may end up highlighting quite different things from any given source. That is precisely why the Wikipedia process of people with different views collaborating is supposed to be a good thing - it's a sort of constant peer review process. But just as in academic peer review you're not supposed to say (or imply) ""ha! you cherrypicking bastard..."", so we're better off assuming good faith here. (That doesn't make criticism impossible, it just means avoiding implications of intentional bias.)

<user_id=The Four Deuces>
So we should say something like ""Chavez uses Twitter to communicate with people and imposes strict censorship on all media""?  BTW, were you aware of the TV station Globovision?  I looked at their website and it appears that the censors have so far missed them.

<user_id=JRSP>
BTW, a recent study reported that Venezuela was ranked 3rd according to twitter penetration and mentioned Chávez account as a possible factor for this high rank.

<user_id=Rd232>
I seem to recall that it was already unusually high before Chavez' account.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The initial argument presented by SandyGeorgia is about the selective presentation of information regarding Hugo Chávez's Twitter account. The concern is that the article may be cherry-picking positive aspects and not presenting a balanced view, which is a valid point in ensuring neutrality in an encyclopedia entry.

2. Jrtayloriv's response suggests that the Twitter account may not be significant enough to warrant inclusion, which is a reasonable perspective on the relevance of the content.

3. SandyGeorgia counters by emphasizing the importance of context, suggesting that Chávez's use of Twitter is relevant when connected to his broader media strategy and views on the internet. This adds depth to the discussion by highlighting the need for comprehensive coverage.

4. JoelWhy and Jrtayloriv discuss the placement of the media section within the article and whether it should be moved or kept under Human Rights. This is a structural consideration that impacts the coherence of the article.

5. The Four Deuces and Jrtayloriv both touch on the issue of bias, agreeing that the article should avoid both pro- and anti-Chávez bias. This is a crucial point for maintaining neutrality.

6. Rd232 brings up the importance of assuming good faith and avoiding accusations of dishonesty, which is a key principle in collaborative editing environments like Wikipedia.

7. The Four Deuces and JRSP introduce additional information about Venezuela's Twitter penetration and the existence of a TV station that may contradict claims of strict censorship. This shows an effort to bring in more information to inform the discussion.

Overall, the participants are engaging in a substantive dialogue that considers the relevance, context, neutrality, and structure of the article content. They are also mindful of Wikipedia's principles, such as assuming good faith and avoiding bias. The discussion is constructive, with participants building on each other's points and providing evidence to support their arguments.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.",8.0
"<user_id=Marschalko>
Evidence base/Evaluation of effectiveness

<user_id=Marschalko>
There are two serious problems with a recent edit of the section Evidence base by , which prompted me to partially revert it: 1) the edit completely removed – without acknowledgment, explanation or justification - the existing content of the section and the associated link to a relevant evidence resource;
2) the table that was inserted misrepresents the contents of the cited source and the relevant table in that source; in particular, by its incorrect and misleading addition of the term “no effect” in relation to various disorders and treatments.

<user_id=CartoonDiablo>
My bad with the revert but how is the image misleading? Its based on the specific table from the study.

<user_id=Marschalko>
The image contains assertions with very significant implications that are not contained in the original table or article, ie, the addition of ""No effect"". The misleading effect of that addition is highlighted when the content of the article as a whole - and in particular, another table in the article, ""Effects of family therapies depending on disorder"" - are considered.
Further, this is only one study - albeit a meta-analysis - and in a field like family therapy, where issues of evidence and research are so vexed and contentious, it is arguably not prudent to present a single table like that (even without additional errors) as being definitive or representative of the state of evidence overall. And in any case, the article is getting a bit old, and, as the first sentence in the section says, the evidence base is evolving.

<user_id=CartoonDiablo>
Well it's not just a review, it's a tertiary source meaning it reviewed 100+ reviews. That aside the ""no effect"" is what the study says, it looked at the therapy and if no significant improvement was found it was seen as ineffective (and therefore not listed on the table).

<user_id=Marschalko>
The article does not say anywhere that family therapy - or any intervention - has ""no effect"" in relation to any disorder. The closest it comes is in saying that psychodynamic treatment for schizophrenia has ""Little or no effect"". And it does not say or imply that any treatment is ""ineffective"" for anything. I think your interpretation of the article is not correct. The article is useful and it should be cited; but it certainly does not support the interpretation that you have proposed. And it has its own limitations and, given the state of evidence for the field as a whole, it should not be accorded the prominence that you seek to give it (even without incorrect interpretations).

<user_id=Marschalko>
Further, I have just checked and have discovered that you have already had a similar dispute re the same issue on the Psychoanalysis page. Evidently you have some personal investment in that table and I don't intend to go through all those same arguments again. For the reasons stated previously, the table is an inappropriate addition to this (and arguably, any) article.

<user_id=CartoonDiablo>
That study would be in the article meaning the article did in fact say that family therapy is ineffective at xyz disease. And in the former we reached a dispute resolution (although the other editor didn't abide by it resulting in two subsequent blocks). As far as I can tell you haven't given an actual reason for excluding the image, its an exact reflection of the study which is rather good seeing as how it looked at 100+ reviews. I'll reinstate it for now and if it becomes an issue we can go to dispute resolution.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Marschalko's Argument:
   - Marschalko raises concerns about the removal of existing content without explanation and the misrepresentation of a source by adding the term ""no effect"" which was not present in the original material.
   - They argue that the field of family therapy has contentious evidence and that a single study should not be presented as definitive.
   - Marschalko also points out that the study is somewhat outdated and that the evidence base for family therapy is evolving.
   - They further note that the user CartoonDiablo has been involved in a similar dispute on another page, suggesting a pattern of behavior.

2. User CartoonDiablo's Argument:
   - CartoonDiablo admits to a mistake with the revert but defends the inclusion of the table based on the study.
   - They argue that the study is a tertiary source that reviewed over 100 reviews, implying a high level of evidence.
   - CartoonDiablo interprets the study as indicating ""no effect"" if no significant improvement was found, equating this to ineffectiveness.
   - They mention a previous dispute resolution on a similar issue, suggesting that they have experience with this type of content dispute.

Evaluation of Arguments:

- Marschalko's argument is based on the accuracy of representation of the source material and the broader context of the evidence base in the field. They emphasize the importance of not misrepresenting research findings and the need for a nuanced view of the evidence, especially in a complex field like family therapy.
- CartoonDiablo's argument hinges on the authority of the study as a tertiary source and their interpretation of the study's findings. However, they do not address Marschalko's concern about the addition of the term ""no effect"" and its potential misrepresentation.

Overall, Marschalko's arguments are more focused on the accuracy and representation of the source material, as well as the evolving nature of evidence in the field, which are important considerations in an encyclopedia. CartoonDiablo's arguments, while valid in terms of the study's scope, seem to lack acknowledgment of the potential for misinterpretation and the importance of accurately reflecting the source material.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5

The score reflects that while there is a reasonable level of discourse with both parties presenting relevant points, there is also room for improvement in terms of addressing each other's concerns more thoroughly and ensuring accurate representation of source material.",6.5
"<user_id=Rmcsamson>
And we're back to square one

<user_id=Rmcsamson>
The disputed section on the status of the J.D. in academia has now fallen into the same old problems of the original versions, with just some minor changes in the wording of the section itself. Sorry, but I can't help but note the bickering by more or less the same editors over the same little things. Can't we just strengthen the sections on the different variants of the J.D.? That might be better than trying to cram something into one section. This appears to have been the way that the article on the M.D. has gone.

<user_id=Sawagner201>
I agree that we should follow the structure of the MD articlespecifically in how it allows for international variantsthereby making the article more clear as a whole.  Putting everything in one section confuses the issue and implies that the degree is identical everywhere.  I think it would stabilize the JD article quite a bit.

<user_id=Wikiant>
No, the real problem is that putting everything in one section makes the issue crystal clear. We have gone the route of dividing the information among the rest of the article. What follows are numerous tweaks: inserting ""doctor,"" ""terminal,"" ""graduate,"" and pictures of doctoral robes throughout; then comes the corresponding tweaks on the other side. You don't make the battle go away, you simply force it to be fought throughout the entire article rather than in a single section.

<user_id=Wikiant>
Also, I disagree that we're back to square one. These last months have brought into clear focus what the issue precisely is: (1) the ABA recommends that the JD be considered equivalent to a Ph.D., (2) in academia, the Ph.D. represents the highest educational level in a discipline, (3) in academia, the SJD/JSD represents the highest educational level in law. Reliable citations all around. End of story.

<user_id=Sawagner201>
As usual, Wikiant is incorrect.  (1) The PhD is not synonymous with ""academia,"" and is but only one degree therein;  (2) The PhD is not the highest degree one can earn (see, for example, higher doctorates); (3) The JD is the highest degree in Law; the SJD is a degree in Juridical Science/Jurisprudence, not Law, and the LLM is in Laws, derived from the latin Legum, referring to specific Laws, not the collective concept of Law (a cite on Georgetown University, I believe previously incldued in this article, discusses that); the citations you have used have been presented in a misleading fashion; they often do not specifically mention the JD, but are talking about professional doctorates generally.  Furthermore, academia is more than just the PhD granting schools at a university.  For example, the highest degree awarded by most law schools is the JD, and this is precisely the degree that qualifies one to be a professor at a law school.  This debate will never go away as long as your push misleading edits.

<user_id=JJL>
The Ph.D., meaning ""Teacher of Philosophy"", is surely closely identified with the very nature of academe. It is the highest degree one can earn in the U.S.at least, there are none higher. The J.D. is unequivocally ''not'' the highest degree in law; you're making up a distinction that doesn't exist (and recall that foreign-trained lawyers, for example, can sometimes use an American LL.M. as their degree to allow them to practice law here). Furthermore, we've produced a long list of citations that address the J.D. in particular as being a professional doctorate accorded lower status than the M.D. (Mwenda and muuka, the differential treatment by the military, the U. of Michigan statement, etc.). The M.F.A. is often the highest degree given in certain artistic fields and qualifies one to be a professor in those fieldsit's a terminal degreebut the D.F.A. exists, is offered by some schools, and is higher. I'm taken aback by how you can claim to see things in the way you indicate. It's simply contrary to what sources have been adduced.

<user_id=Rmcsamson>
On (1) Yes. (2) Most of the higher doctorates are now only given honoris causa, which means they're not really an academic qualification that one uses together with degrees actually studied for. (3) I have absolutely no idea where you get this distinction other than the translations of the degree names from Latin, and agree with JJL on this point.

<user_id=Sk75>
I think you may be overstating the evidence that the JD is accorded a ""lower"" status than the MD.  (I remain skeptical of the very notion that one doctoral degree can have a lower or higher position than the others although certainly people hold varying opinions, particularly based on the duration of the programs, about the rigor and value of those degrees.)
First, none of the military citations I've read indicate that any difference in the treatment of doctors and lawyers in the U.S. armed services are attributable to the degree itself rather than the profession they practice in the armed forces.
Second, I think that the Mwenda source actually suggests that the MD cannot properly be viewed as any kind of doctorate. It quotes from another source (Phillips and Pugh) that suggests the MD is a bachelor's degree: ""[G]eneral medical practitioners are given the honorary title of Doctor although they do not have a doctorate from their universities. Indeed, on the basis of their university course they are credited with two bachelor's degrees..."" (90). (It's not even clear to me that Mwenda is referring to the American academia in this statement.) Mwenda also apparently regards the JD as a kind of second-entry bachelor's degree: ""[T]he U.S. law degree program is neither a master's degree nor a doctorate"" (87). In Mwenda's worldview, as I read it, the only kind of doctorate is the PhD and other dissertation doctorates. I suggest that this is a fringe viewpoint when describing American higher ed. Indeed, on pages 89-90, Mwenda states that ""most professional doctorates, unlike a JD, have both taught and research components, culminating in the presentation of a thesis or dissertation,"" and Mwenda cites the DBA and DEng degrees as proper professional doctorates. The Wikipedia pages on the DBA and DEng describes them as a research doctorates. Thus, while I understand Mwenda's point, I view it as (1) an argument for how the author thinks things ought to be conceptualized and (2) contrary to the consensus view of professional doctorates in the United States.
Third, the U. Michigan statement was simply that the JD is not the same as a traditional higher-ed doctorate, like the Ph.D. I understand that statement to mean the JD is not a research doctorate, which I think we all agree on. I don't read it as saying the JD is inferior to the PhD. And I don't see how it relates at all to the MD.
Also, I think you dismiss Sawagner201's point too quickly. Even the Mwenda source describes some evidence that the LLM and SJD degrees are ""'illegitimate' children"" in the family of law degrees (93). Mwenda notes that the LLM and SJD degrees ""do not attract much professional respect or recognition from many quarters of the U.S. legal profession"" (93), and, indeed, at the Cornell Law School ""in exceptional cases"" a JSD or LLM candidate can transfer to the JD program. Mwenda condemns the whole system as ""illogical"" (95). However they are regarded, I am not convinced they can be seen as ""higher"" degrees in a ""vertical"" progression with the JD at the base of the progression.
For those editors who wish to view the Mwenda source directly, it is accessible at bit(dot)ly/b4F4qq. After reading it over again, I wonder if this source is a ""questionable source"" under Wikipedia's rules because the views it expresses are ""widely acknowledged as extremist"" (such as the MD is not any kind of doctorate) and ""rel[ies] heavily on rumors and personal opinions."" Look, for instance at how Mwenda quotes extensively on page 91 from a blog post on one lawyer's blog. I'm not sure it crosses the line into ""questionable"" territory, but for me it comes close.

<user_id=JJL>
You direct me to pg. 90 of M&M...the; very first sentence is ""Getting back to the case of the United Kingdom."" In the U.K., would-be physicians receive two bachelor's degrees (see MBBS) and are accorded the courtesy title 'Doctor' despite not having a doctorate. It's a completely different system. Quoting Wikipedia as a source on the DBA and DEng degrees isn't helpful. As to the question of whether the J.D.>LL.M.>S.J.D. progression is legitimate or not, given that that's the order of prerequisites I'd need to see a source rather than a WP:SYNTH here. The U. of M. statement seems clear enough to me. To suggest that M&M; expresses ""extremist"" views in the context of all the other material advanced that aligns with those views is to simply dismiss an entire side of this debate. In any event, Mwenda's academic work is clearly a preferred source in the context of WP:RS. In any event, let's be clear: The M.D. is not always accorded the same status as is the Ph.D., but both are accorded higher status than the J.D.
Things are really moving in the wrong direction here.

@Sawagner201  The Phd is the highest degree earned in the United states... End of story. The JD is not the highest degree that can be earned in law; the JD is nothing more than an LLB masquerading as a so-called professional doctorate. If I ever meet a lawyer with a JD, who requests to be addressed as “Dr”, I will laugh straight at their face.  Also, the ABA is an accreditation group of lawyers; to have the ABA declare that the JD is equivalent to the PhD lol, is like having a bunch of monkeys claiming to be humans. I see you have a JD, so I am not shocked about your stance. I suggest you take your ass and get a “real” doctorate degree ….loser lol.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=Zoticogrillo>
The US developed a unique system of professional programs of study (law, medicine, business, etc) that is separate from the research or ""academic"" programs. It was originally believed in other countries that professional skills should only be taught in the field, through apprenticeships for example, and that all universities teach only academic theory and research.  This perspective changed in the US, and the JD and MD were born.  That has started to change outside the US, but the change is fairly recent and usually only adopted piece-meal.  The JD is a professional degree, not a research degree, and is the terminal professional degree in the field of law.  I hope that my citations clarifying this haven't been removed, but I'm having a hard time finding them, which is a shame, because they added a great deal of clarity.

<user_id=Wikiant>
We seem to agree that the SJD is a research (i.e., academic) degree. The fact that the JD is a prerequisite for the LLM and (in turn) for the SJD indicates that the JD is indeed not separate from academic programs.

<user_id=Rmcsamson>
I actually fail to see how the J.D. is NOT an academic program. It's not a research-oriented program (even if J.D. students are trained in some form of legal research), but it's an academic program. I thought that was pretty obvious. Hahaha.

<user_id=JJL>
The distinction is between academic degrees like the M.A. and professional degrees like the M.F.A. In a broad sense both are degrees from an academy of higher learning and hence are 'academic degrees' but when used more narrowly they separate a professional degree like the J.D. from a (purely) academic degree like the S.J.D. that isn't intended to prepare a person for a profession.
The current wordingimplying that the distinctions made w.r.t. the J.D. are the same as for any other professional degreeisn't what we've been trying to address here and is weaker than what's in the sources. It sidesteps, rather than addresses, the reason for having this section.

<user_id=Zoticogrillo>
Let's allow for variations in usage of English internationally: The term ""academic"" in this context is used differently in the U.S. than in commonwealth countries.  Let's just use the term ""research,"" and remember that the U.S. is not a commonwealth country nor a part of the ""Oxbridge"" system.  Comparing the J.D. to a research degree is like comparing apples and oranges.  Now, who erased those citations?  In fact, there are a whole TON of citations that have been thrown to the windcitations from both sides of the issue.  We should really try and include all interesting material relevant to the article, regardless of our opinions.  Again, those citations that explain the differences in the U.S. between research degrees and professional degrees to non-U.S. readers are particularly useful.  Wikiant's reasoning that all elements in a series must be of the same type is flawed (i.e. that the JD is not a separate academic program because it is a prerequisite for research degrees).

<user_id=Zoticogrillo>
btw, re-reading the section in question: Duh!  It's obvious: Because they are both reseach doctorates!  One in law, the other in philosophy.    I mean, the last sentence, saying that the SJD is equiv to the PhD.

<user_id=Wikiant>
At least with respect to the JD, the division between professional and research degrees raises two troubling issues. (1) Based on your repeated emphasis that ""doctor is latin for teacher,"" since the point of the JD is to prepare one to practice law, not teach law, the JD is not a ""doctorate"". (2) The application of ""doctor"" as an indicator of the JD being terminal relies on an arbitrary and artificial distinction. The body of knowledge required for the practice of law is a subset of the body of knowledge required for the research of law. I can make similar arbitrary distinctions to show that the MBA is a terminal degree. For that matter, one can argue that a high school diploma is terminal for the practice of a trade.

<user_id=Zoticogrillo>
That's interesting.  However, there is still a division between professional and research doctorates in the U.S., and it's not my idea.  Please research the issue more, using the citations I provided in previous versions of the article and the archived discussions.

<user_id=Rmcsamson>
Actually, there's something to be said about this. If ""doctor"" is latin for teacher, then ""juris doctor"" means ""teacher of the law/jurisprudence"" (no need to get technical on the meaning of law vs. jurisprudence at this point). I agree that the J.D. is meant to prepare one to practice law. But the J.D. also suffices as adequate training to allow someone to actually teach law. Having an LLM and an SJD will probably be indicative of better training as an academic researcher, but in terms of teaching law, especially teaching in the sense that the classes taught prepare a student for legal practice? The J.D. seems rather adequate.

<user_id=Deep Purple Dreams>
I should also note that a J.D. seems to be sufficient to teach law.

<user_id=67.182.112.70>
The Phd is the highest degree earned in the United states. End of story. Really? It can be logically argued that the J.S.D. ""is the highest degree earned in the United States.""
[T]the JD is not the highest degree that can be earned in law. But that is also true of the D.D.S./D.M.D. (The Juris Doctor resembles the D.D.S./D.M.D., which is the prerequisite for the Master of Dental Science (M.S.D.), making the M.S.D. the terminal academic degree in dentistry.)
[T]he JD is nothing more than an LLB masquerading as a so-called professional doctorate. It can be logically argued that this is also true of the D.D.S./D.M.D.
If I ever meet a lawyer with a JD, who requests to be addressed as “Dr”, I will laugh straight at their face. It is immodest and rude for any degree holder to make such a request.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Understanding of the issue**: The participants demonstrate a clear understanding of the issue at hand, which is the status of the J.D. degree in academia and its comparison to other degrees such as the Ph.D. and S.J.D. They bring up various aspects of the debate, including the ABA's recommendations, the nature of the J.D. as a professional versus a research degree, and the hierarchy of law degrees.

2. **Use of evidence**: Many participants reference external sources, such as the ABA, university statements, and academic articles, to support their arguments. This shows a reliance on evidence rather than purely personal opinion, which is a positive aspect of the discussion.

3. **Respectful discourse**: Most of the participants engage in a respectful and professional manner, with the exception of the comment from user 76.21.212.171, which includes personal attacks and derogatory language. This lowers the overall quality of the discussion.

4. **Clarity and coherence**: The arguments presented are generally clear and coherent, with participants often responding directly to points made by others. This helps to advance the discussion and allows for a more in-depth exploration of the topic.

5. **Relevance**: The arguments are relevant to the topic and focus on the core issue of the J.D. degree's status. There is little to no deviation into unrelated matters, which maintains the quality of the discussion.

6. **Diversity of perspectives**: The discussion includes a range of perspectives, with some participants arguing for the J.D. as a terminal professional degree and others emphasizing its differences from research doctorates. This diversity is beneficial as it provides a more rounded view of the issue.

7. **Logical reasoning**: Participants use logical reasoning to support their points, such as the progression of law degrees (J.D.>LL.M.>S.J.D.) and the implications of the term ""doctor"" in different contexts. However, there are instances where the logic is challenged by others, indicating that there is room for interpretation and debate.

8. **Civility**: With the exception of one uncivil comment, the discussion maintains a level of civility that allows for constructive debate.

Considering these factors, the discussion is informative and mostly well-conducted, with a variety of viewpoints and evidence presented. However, the presence of an uncivil and disrespectful comment detracts from the overall quality.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Formal Theorem

<user_id=166.205.136.246>
It was obvious from the preceding discussion that two articles (one clearly a POV fork) were not needed so I have redirected Formal Theorem here.  If after further discussion and consensus it's determined that there is material in Formal Theorem not adequately covered here with due weight, it can be added to this article.

<user_id=Gregbard>
This anonymous editor is unclear on the difference between POV and WEIGHT. It would be helpful is he identified himself so we can address any POV issues that he may manifesting historically. I suspect that is why he is choosing to be anonymous.

<user_id=Gregbard>
As for the claim of POV itself, all of the content of formal theorem is objectively stated subject matter. If there are any particular statements which we could address rather than a blanket characterization, that would be helpful.

<user_id=166.205.138.83>
Fine, back as it was

<user_id=Gregbard>
The group has had a year to find a mutually acceptable way to integrate the content in a merge. So far, they demonstrated no inclination or competence in doing so. Separating the content portrays more POV than integrating it for reasons I pointed out at WT:MATH.

<user_id=Arthur Rubin>
The ""merge"" now performed is still not acceptable.  The articles are about different, but related, concepts.  I've attempted to revert the merge, but I'm not sure I've done it correctly.  —

<user_id=Gregbard>
Um yeah, Arthur, clearly they are not two different concepts. I think you are going off the deep end with that claim. There is no reasonable claim that a theorem, and a theorem expressed in formal language are different concepts because the whole point is that we are able to express the same concept informally and formally. Face it Arthur, this is a genuine case of you POV getting in the way of you seeing reality.

<user_id=Arthur Rubin>
On the contrary, they clearly '''are''' two different concepts, if we can agree and what ""are"" means.  On the other hand, they are fairly well related, so a single article would be acceptable, '''if''' ""formalism"" is minimized in what was previously in theorem before the merge.  (Aside from problems with infinitary logic and proofs, which doesn't seem to be anywhere in the article at the moment, as they weren't there before the merge.  They ''should'' be there.)  —

<user_id=Gregbard>
No, not on the contrary. You are confusing the fact that there are different senses of a term, and two different concepts. It absolutely is you and the the others who are imposing POV, whereas I am covering the same concept from different methodology, which is how articles become comprehensive. You really are off base here Arthur, and it really is your POV that is blinding you to that fact. I don't know how you would minimize the coverage more than placing it below ""lore"" and the other junk. the section itself is quite concise. Be well,

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The initial argument presented by the anonymous user with the ID 166.205.136.246 is about the redundancy of two articles, suggesting a merge due to one being a POV (Point of View) fork. The user suggests that if there is content in the ""Formal Theorem"" article not covered in the merged article, it can be added later. This argument is practical and aims at reducing redundancy, but it lacks detail on why the content is considered a POV fork and does not provide specific examples.

2. Gregbard responds by questioning the anonymous user's understanding of POV versus WEIGHT and requests the user to identify themselves to address any historical POV issues. Gregbard defends the content of the ""Formal Theorem"" article as objectively stated. This response is somewhat defensive and does not address the core issue of redundancy but instead focuses on the anonymity of the other user and the objectivity of the content.

3. The anonymous user with the ID 166.205.138.83 simply states ""Fine, back as it was,"" which does not contribute to the argument's quality as it does not provide any reasoning or further explanation.

4. Gregbard then argues that the group has had ample time to integrate the content and accuses them of lacking inclination or competence to do so. This argument is more of an ad hominem attack on the group's abilities rather than a constructive contribution to the discussion about the content itself.

5. Arthur Rubin steps in, stating that the articles are about different but related concepts and attempts to revert the merge. He acknowledges that a single article could be acceptable if formalism is minimized. This argument introduces a new perspective on the relationship between the concepts and suggests a compromise, which is constructive.

6. Gregbard counters Arthur Rubin's argument by stating that they are not two different concepts and accuses Arthur of letting his POV interfere with his judgment. This response is confrontational and does not provide evidence or reasoning to support the claim that the concepts are not different.

7. Arthur Rubin clarifies that the concepts are different but related and that a single article would be acceptable with certain conditions. He also mentions missing content related to infinitary logic and proofs, which adds to the discussion by pointing out gaps in the content.

8. Gregbard's final comment accuses Arthur Rubin of imposing POV and insists that covering the same concept from different methodologies is comprehensive. The argument is dismissive and does not engage with Arthur Rubin's points about differentiating the concepts and the missing content.

Overall, the discussion includes a mix of practical suggestions, defensive responses, ad hominem attacks, and attempts at compromise. There is a lack of evidence and specific examples to support claims, and some arguments are more focused on personal disagreements than on the content quality and organization.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 4.",4.0

Some spellings of character names

<user_id=186.32.118.21>
Athena's name needs not to be corrected. In Kurumada's manga, and all related SS media, her name is spelled both in kanji and katakana: 女神 (Megami, goddess) with the furigana アテナ (Atena = Athena), over it. So both instances are correct and there's no reason to remove.
Additionally, Scorpio doesn't need to be changed to Scorpion in the other SS articles, as though the katakana indeed is transliterated as Scorpion, the western name of the constellation is SCORPIO, and besides, numerous official media and merchandise use the rendering Scorpio, in the same way, some mechandise use the renderings Syura or Miro, but for general consensus, Shura and Milo are more widely used, the same case for Scorpion.

<user_id=Ryulong>
Okay, so we have ""Megami"" and ""Atena"", which means '''we should use both on this article'''. Not one or the other. So stop changing it to a way that is entirely shit.—

<user_id=Onikiri>
Dude, show some class. I wrote the entire Omega article and its character list, I wrote the bios for Kurumada's Gold Saints in the main SS character list, also fixed and added to all the other characters over the past years. Also have contributed to every SS character list, except Episode G. So I know what to keep and what to remove. I can read and speak japanese and I along many other users have kept the SS articles, long before you came along. So behave a bit. Anyway, any unneeded change you make, reverting is in order. If you contribute something useful, it is welcome.

<user_id=Ryulong>
This is a textbook example of WP:OWN. You are not welcoming ''any'' of the changes I've made to the page, which is for the most part removing any WP:OR name translation nonsense and adding in the proper furigana for the characters' names. You are also logging out and making the edits as 186.32.118.21 so it looks like there is more than one person involved against me. I have been trying to fix these pages up because '''you've written them entirely from the fandom perspective and are expecting people to know that all of the character names do not use the Japanese language names of the constellations'''. This is a practice in Japan for these things and it's a general practice (although not yet codified) on the English Wikipedia. You have done nothing to the page except remove my constant good faith additions of the katakana readings, as well as minor formatting issues, because you are acting as the only person who can be trusted to modify these pages. My changes do nothing drastic to the article that it's required your constant reverting of anything I do, and in fact the more you edit logged out or use false edit summaries (which is a really big no no on Wiki) shows you have no intention of compromising here. You have to realize that I am coming at this page from a different perspective, and it entirely improper to say that a series of Japanese characters that anywhere outside of the Saint Seiya franchise would be read as ""Kajikiza"" are ""Dorado"" '''without providing the means to show that they're different'''.—

<user_id=Ryulong>
If there was a consensus at some point, it was clearly just made up by you and several years ago. Consensuses change and now that I've taken a look at these pages, I can say that they are quite problematic. The fact that you just don't remove the katakana that I've added but feel the need to blindly revert everything I've done to make them in line with the rest of the pages on completely different anime is really annoying. As is the fact that you are actually actively reverting to the revision to the page that I specificially made for you to revert to so you wouldn't remove all of the beneficial changes I made to the page, such as putting a space between Saori Kido's first and last names or removing the entirely unnecessary WP:OR literal name translations.—

<user_id=Sjones23>
After Ryulong's nudging on my talk page, I figured that I would post here. Nobody owns the article and we do not want an edit war (which is forbidden) to occur here. I also agree with Ryulong that the literal name translations are considered original research.   - )

<user_id=Ryulong>
The blanking of the katakana spellings of characters' names (Pegasasu instead of Tenma-za) is my main issue on this and other Saint Seiya pages, though. Because I went through all of the Saint Seiya character pages and updated them to use better formatting but Onikiri, while logged out, undid every single edit I made (in some cases twice).—

<user_id=Sjones23>
Oh, blustering barnacles! I forgot to mention that it was improper to remove katakana from the Saint Seiya pages, as I also feel that katakana is necessary. For example, when referring to Pegasus Seiya, the Pegasus constellation in his name is written as 天馬座 in Kanji and written in katakana as ペガサス, since we always use katakana when referring to Saints in the character articles.   - )

<user_id=Ryulong>
Yeah, and it's particularly bad when you have かじき座 and it's read as ドラド or when トナカイ座 is カリブー. Those readings are so off from the '''hiragana and katakana''' written names.—

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The initial argument presented by user 186.32.118.21 is about the correct spelling of character names in the Saint Seiya series. They provide specific examples of how names are spelled in both kanji and katakana, arguing that both spellings are correct and commonly used in official media and merchandise. This argument is fact-based and relevant to the discussion.

2. User Ryulong responds by emphasizing the importance of using both the kanji and katakana forms of the names in the article, which is a reasonable suggestion for clarity and accuracy. However, the tone of the response is confrontational, which may detract from the quality of the argument.

3. User Onikiri defends their position by citing their extensive contributions to the Saint Seiya articles and their knowledge of Japanese. They argue for maintaining the status quo based on their experience and contributions. While experience is valuable, it does not necessarily justify resistance to change or improvements.

4. User Ryulong accuses Onikiri of ownership behavior (WP:OWN) and not welcoming changes. They also bring up the issue of potential sock puppetry (editing logged out to appear as multiple users). Ryulong's argument is focused on Wikipedia policies and the need for transparency and accuracy in the articles.

5. User Sjones23 steps in to remind everyone that no one owns the article and to discourage edit warring. They agree with Ryulong that literal name translations are considered original research, which is against Wikipedia's guidelines. This is a constructive contribution to the discussion, as it references Wikipedia's policies and encourages collaboration.

6. Ryulong and Sjones23 both agree on the importance of including katakana for clarity, especially when the readings of the names are significantly different from the standard hiragana and katakana. This is a strong argument for maintaining accuracy and consistency in the articles.

Overall, the discussion includes a mix of fact-based arguments, policy references, and personal experiences. While there are some confrontational elements, the core of the discussion revolves around maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the Wikipedia articles, which is a positive focus. However, the tone of the discussion could be more collaborative and less adversarial to improve the quality of the debate.

Possible causes

<user_id=ZScarpia>
Not, so far as I can see, currently given in the article as a possible cause for the collision is that the captain left it too late to execute the turn which headed the ship along the coast of Giglio. This Telegraph article quotes the captain as having said: ""I was navigating by sight because I knew the depths   well and I had done this manoeuvre three or four times. But this time I   ordered the turn too late and I ended up in water that was too shallow."" Higher up, the (newspaper) article states that the reef was well marked. There is an ambiguity there which would perhaps be worth looking into, well marked meaning that the reef could have been marked by buoys as well as being shown clearly on charts. If the reef was marked by buoys, it would compound the culpability for the collision.       ←      (Clarified that it is the Telegraph article that says the reef is well marked: )

<user_id=SteveO1951>
This new Possible Causes section has far too many speculations (long since abandoned) that do not apply in this incident. Please trim it or rip it. The matter is covered in Shipwreck and any edits should go there, not in a separate section riddled with old theories. Also, I am not aware that any part of the Article says that the reef is ""well marked""; it states that it is charted, which is different. Marked means that there is an ""aid to navigation"" visible to the eye on or near a hazard. The charts show no aids to navigation and none has been alleged by any published source.

<user_id=ZScarpia>
The point I was making is that the captain himself was quoted as saying that he left the turn too late and ended up in shallow water, which seems like an important point which I can't see currently mentioned in the article. So, it was an error which the captain himself supposedly admitted, not speculation.       ←    

<user_id=SteveO1951>
Anyone wanting to learn how to read a nautical chart should start with NOAA Chart 1, which is not a chart at all but rather defines all the features of a chart and what they mean. http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/mcd/chartno1.htm  That said, I can help by telling you that the little dotted circle is an indication that the water at that spot is shallower than surrounding water but is not a rock. And finally, none of this matters: if you read the Article, and the footnotes about the impact point, you can find that police divers photographed the point of impact, a subsurface rock, within Le Scole reef, known as Scole Piccola. It has nothing to do with the circle of shallower water. I hope this helps.

<user_id=SteveO1951>
The Article states the best possible evidence for where ""the captain ended up"" and that is that the divers photographed huge strips of ship's hull at Scole Piccola (see my post above explaining about nautical charts). Yes, the captain says ""I turned too late"" but he never used the words ""into shallow water"" or the Italian equivalent. Some editors argue that we ought not put in what the captain ""said"" or what the company ""said"" but rather only put in what happened according to consensus publications. As is, the Article does presently give some names to statements, because that is part of the story. Later, a year from now, I believe the article will not have all this detail about who said what but rather will state that the captain was sailing without the computer navigation system and failed to turn in time and struck the reef.

<user_id=SteveO1951>
I have disputed this section of the Article because, at least, it twice uses the words ""not yet"" in respect of surmized causes not having been ruled out. Although those old sources might have used those words (as of the publication date), it is highly misleading to have them in the Article text after the facts are much more clear. The captain has admitted that he was sailing solely by sight and turned too late. End of story. There was no other cause for the initial impact and no current publication or source is saying that any other cause exists. Also this section asserts misleadingly that the ship ""went slightly closer to Giglio"" on 14 August; well, in a certain sense that cannot be true (!) and the ship did not on that day go closer to Le Scole but rather went close to a cliff (Punta Gabbianara) having no extending reef, and it was in daylight and the ship was then using its computer controlled steering. This is bad, outdated, misleading text.   And BTW, the fact that she sailed close on 14 august is entirely irrelevant to the cause of this incident. It may be true but it is misleading as stated by this old story.

<user_id=SteveO1951>
I found the longer quotation and put it in. ""Someday"" all this detail will not be necessary but so long as this section has outdated, misleading, ""not well written"" (I am trying to be polite) statements on Possible Causes, then I will continue to have to counterbalance that by the great mass of current, undisputed published evidence that there is only one cause - the Captain erred in steering the route he intended.

<user_id=195.137.93.171>
Thanks - it's 35 years since I was a Sea Scout ! Looks like it would have been blue inside if it were a 'danger line'. They may not have been expecting the Concordia when risk assessing it, though ! I did see an impressive photo of a serpentine steel strip yesterday, but I didn't see its location. I'm sure the rock embedded in the hull must have left some useful traces, too.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. The first user, ZScarpia, introduces a point about the captain's admission of error, which is not currently mentioned in the article. This is a relevant point because it directly addresses the cause of the collision.

2. SteveO1951 responds by emphasizing the importance of relying on consensus publications and factual evidence rather than individual statements. This is a valid argument in the context of maintaining an objective and verifiable Wikipedia article.

3. User 195.137.93.171 brings up a question about the nautical chart symbols and the visibility of the reef, which is relevant to understanding the circumstances of the collision. However, this user's argument is based on personal interpretation of the chart rather than expert analysis, which weakens the argument's strength.

4. SteveO1951 provides a resource for understanding nautical charts and clarifies the meaning of the chart symbols. This contributes positively to the discussion by offering educational material and clarifying potential misunderstandings.

5. SteveO1951 also disputes the Possible Causes section for containing outdated and misleading information. This is a strong argument for ensuring that the article reflects the most current and accurate information available.

6. The same user, SteveO1951, adds a longer quotation from the captain to provide more context. This is a constructive addition that enhances the article's accuracy and completeness.

7. User 195.137.93.171 shares a personal anecdote and acknowledges the potential for new evidence to emerge, such as the photo of the steel strip. While this is an interesting point, it does not directly contribute to the quality of the argument regarding the article's content.

Overall, the discussion includes relevant points about the importance of factual accuracy, the use of current information, and the interpretation of nautical charts. There is a clear effort to improve the article's quality by removing speculation and focusing on verified information. The participants are engaged in a constructive dialogue, with some users providing educational resources and others raising questions that prompt further clarification.

The Disputed tag for example, ""Work on this translation was prompted by the perceived trend towards looseness of style and content and theological liberalism in modern English Bible translations...""
The ESV moves toward the masculine of classical Greek in an updated King James and Tyndale tradition Bible. This was a limited gender-neutral language use Bible.

<user_id=Basileias>
Major article changes (Advert & Disputed tags)

<user_id=Lionelt>
Clearly not advertisement. The POV tag might be more appropriate. In any event I'm removing the ADVERT tag. Regarding DISPUTED I can't verify the sources because they are offline. If the editor who added this content could place quotes on the talk page (or the article) it would be appreciated. –

<user_id=JohnChrysostom>
I added the sources, and some of the content. I'll come back and type of references tomorrow, as I've been up since this time yesterday. (You can also check Google Books, which sometimes has them. The journal articles are long, and as far as the Bibliotheca Sacra, almost every word is pertinent.) I included a representative supporting quote from a few sources, and believe the content could stand on those few quotes and sources, but added extras for back-up/redundancy/RS concerns.  

<user_id=JohnChrysostom>
Actually, yes, all of those claims in the ""translation philosophy"" section were directly from the ESV introduction or ESV study Bible introduction. Sorry for delays, bad thunderstorm (Columbus, OH).  

<user_id=In ictu oculi>
I can't see that the article was that bad, at all, but JohnChrysostom's edits have improved it.

<user_id=JohnChrysostom>
Okay, Basileias, what statements currently sourced do you want supporting quotes from those sources for? Thy wish is my command to my fingers to type thy wish.  

<user_id=Basileias>
I was not the user that asked for quotes. I covered my issues in my original talk page post. For example, I do not know why Isaiah 7:14 is being covered with commentary in this article. ""Isaiah 7:14: Messianic interpretations are precluded by interpreting almah as ""young woman""[12][13] and translating accordingly as in RSV, NRSV, REB, also contradicting both Matthew's and Luke's interpretation of the passage and thus speaking against Biblical inspiration;"". There is already an article for Isaiah 7:14.

<user_id=Basileias>
Second, ""Work on this translation was prompted by the perceived trend towards looseness of style and content and theological liberalism in modern English Bible translations, such as the New International Version Inclusive Language Edition (NIVI) of 1996, which introduced large amounts of gender-neutral or ""inclusive"" language, which some found to be objectionable, and the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) which did the same...""....this seems contradict what the publisher of the ESV has stated, ""The real origin of the ESV Bible goes back to the early 1990s, long before the gender-language controversy, when Crossway’s president, Dr. Lane T. Dennis, talked to a number of Christian scholars and pastors about the need for a new literal translation."" (http://www.crossway.org/blog/2006/02/origin-of-the-esv/). And I did not even have to look hard for this.

<user_id=JohnChrysostom>
Point 2. The sources contradict, then. Maybe they were mulling it over in the early 1990s (in that case being prompted by the NRSV or NJB, which heralded the gender neutral debate), but everything else I've read (secondary sources) say that it was a somewhat kneejerk reaction to the NIVI, or at least that's what prompted them to actually get it out (which is bolstered by Strauss and, oppositely, for the advertising rhetoric for the ESV as a ""non-neutered"" translation, much like the RSV-2CE, and, on the issue of time, for example, the Catholic NAB, prompted by ''Divino Afflante Spiritu'' 70 years ago, was completed in 1986, and just revised enough to achieve Vatican approval in 2011... Bibles take a long time without impetus), and that may be why, reading it, it comes across as slapshod in places (adjacent parts using different gender-language, due to an insufficient revision, I think) - but all of that is speculation or original research, so not in the article. If you feel the desire to rewrite the first two sentences of the ""circumstances"" paragraph to conform to that, I have no objection (although I do feel the ESV website may be less reliable in a sense than secondary sources, and more reliable in another, as those secondary sources are generally filled with more conjecture than a Wikipedia page so heavily tagged that it is unreadable).

<user_id=JohnChrysostom>
Point 1. Isaiah 7:14 is treated briefly (one or two sentences, I think), because it is a touchstone for this and similar translations, along with the other verses mentioned; such are often mentioned by defenders of the ESV (and NASB, KJV, NKJV, etc. as well), and the original ""RSV Isaiah 7:14 controversy"" lays directly behind this (as it's a revision of the RSV, to which this gives context - and sources). The ESV is a conservative and evangelical version; most things written on it are going to be by conservative evangelicals (and, surprisingly, some Catholic Bishops' Conferences) just as one can find nothing written by them on the NRSV except for short dismissals, or endless debates over the neutered language. I added the sources about ""almah as virgin"" because I took it, in your original post, that you were disputing that in the article - not the very inclusion of it. Isaiah 7:14, Psalm 2, Genesis 1:1,3 are the OT touchstones and rallying cries of these Bibles (""Word of God in English"", Bibliotheca Sacra), and Psalm 1 and Genesis 3:15 are the touchstones for the gender-neutral controversy (as all of the neutered ones use the incorrect ""singular"" they in those locations). These few verses are the main changes in the ESV (beyond the removal of archaic language and the moderate neutering) as compared to anything else in the RV-ASV-RSV-NRSV line, and the perceived improper rendering of these verses were what this translation was designed to rectify.  

<user_id=Basileias>
I do not recall Crossway ever using advertising meaning ""non-neutered"" in their marketing. I understood the NIVI to only have been a UK release. I think sources could be problematic because it takes years to plan for a translation if it was responsible for the ESV. I think I know someone who has a copy of the Worthington post in my link. I want to read it. I also want to update myself on the topic before I edit.

<user_id=JohnChrysostom>
Not in the words ""non-neutered"", no, but in heavy criticism of gender-neutral language and in stating that theirs was different. Take your time, Wikipedia is a WP:WORKINPROGRESS with WP:NODEADLINE. The NIVI was UK only, but it was planned for release in US but never got it because of the evangelical uproar; it was quietly ditched. Not until nine years later, when it was rebranded as ""Today's New International Version"", and, then, after accustomizing the public to it, trading the regular NIV for the NIVI in 2011. I don't know if you read the Bible, but the ESV, especially in the 2001 revision, and even now, has a once-over uneven feel in places - some were subjected to revision, vast tracts are the RSV. It feels rushed: objectionable parts were redacted and the sections around them revised, tracts with no objectionable material left untouched: at the borders of these divisions, one can see two completely different gender-language philosophies in chapter 26 and 27, for example (although I still think it to be one of the best Bibles available in an edition with the full 73-book canon in modern English; the NASB and NKJV have no full-canon edition, NETS, OSB, Knox, RSV-2CE, Old Jerusalem and Goodspeed would come close, DRC, CCD, Brenton and KJV [or TMB] for old [Early Modern] English).  

<user_id=Basileias>
I know every translation team will have their approach to translation and gender language. I do know the NIVI is not the NIV update, though I am sure many renderings could be similar and same. How many different ways can you translate John 3:16? The NIV translation team did the work on the Today's New International Version, where if I am remembering correctly, the NIVI was outsourced. None of this though has anything to do with the ESV.

<user_id=JohnChrysostom>
Still - compare any passage in the three editions. The TNIV and NIVI have identical renderings in every location I've checked (admittedly, not many - about a dozen passages and two random chapters, Genesis 3 and 1 Corinthians 10), and the 1984 NIV renderings are different. The 2011 NIV takes all of the readings from the TNIV/I over wholesale!  

<user_id=JohnChrysostom>
And to answer your rhetorical question... uh, fifteen? ''monogenes'' admits to at least four renderings (""only"", ""one and only"", ""one of a kind"", ""only-begotten""), and then add in the ""for God so loved the world"", ""God loved the world like this"", ""God loved the world in this way"", ""God loved the world so much"" [''sic''], ""perish"", ""die"", or ""be destroyed"", the word for ""whosoever"", ""anyone"", ""everyone"", ""all"", life ""eternal"", ""everlasting"", ""always"", ""forever"", ""age-enduring"".... more like one hundred fifty possible, although there are four (or five) main renderings of it that I've seen throughout all modern English translations (six [or seven] if one counts orthographic differences in early modern English, ""whosoever"", ""believeth"") -D Not a good example because there's no way to neuter it, unless you're an extremist and do ""child"" or ""son-daughter"" as I've seen in some commentaries.  

<user_id=Basileias>
The updated NIV does not take all renderings from the TNIV and the NIVI wholesale. A lot will be the similar, but that statement is not even close to the realm of reality. I will refer you to ESV translator Bill Mounce's perspectives. Again, all of which has nothing to do with the ESV.

<user_id=Basileias>
Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” (updated NIV)
Then God said, “Let us make human beings in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” (TNIV)

<user_id=JohnChrysostom>
Indeed, I missed that - I said I checked only Genesis 3 (Protevangelium) and 1 Corinthians 10 (women are to be silent in church: these being two chapters that gender-neutral translations love to rewrite: and, also, 1 Tim 3 (qualifications of bishops), which I forgot about) and a few Messianic prophecies (most are still there except for Psalm 8). In these places, almost every single rendering is TNIV wholesale. I didn't read the whole thing (I don't use even the old NIV or own one). Thanks for pointing that out, that it is just ""influenced"" or ""heavily influenced"" by the TNIV, not just a rebranding of it.

A friend had a copy of the removed post Crossway was responding to. The stories about a kneejerk reaction to what other publishers were doing the ESV publisher regards as second hand tales. I thought as much. I have move the history introduction in line with the source from Crossway.

",0,"The discussion revolves around the content and sourcing of an article related to the English Standard Version (ESV) Bible translation. The participants are debating the accuracy and neutrality of the article's content, particularly concerning the translation's history and philosophy.

1. **Argument about Advert and Disputed tags**: User Basileias argues that certain phrases in the article sound promotional and that the history of the ESV's creation may be disputed. The user suggests that the article's content may not be neutral and could be biased towards the ESV.

2. **Response to tags and request for sources**: User Lionelt challenges the Advert tag, suggesting that a POV (Point of View) tag might be more appropriate, and asks for sources to verify the disputed content.

3. **Provision of sources and explanations**: User JohnChrysostom provides sources and explanations for the content, acknowledging that some claims were directly from the ESV introductions, which could be seen as primary sources and potentially less neutral.

4. **Discussion of specific content (Isaiah 7:14)**: User Basileias questions the inclusion of commentary on Isaiah 7:14 within the article, arguing that it may not be relevant to the ESV article itself. JohnChrysostom defends the inclusion by explaining the significance of the verse in the context of the ESV and its translation philosophy.

5. **Contradictory sources and history of ESV**: User Basileias points out a contradiction between secondary sources and the publisher's statement regarding the ESV's origin. JohnChrysostom acknowledges the contradiction and suggests that secondary sources may contain conjecture.

6. **Marketing language and translation comparisons**: The discussion shifts to the marketing language used by Crossway for the ESV and comparisons between different Bible translations (NIVI, TNIV, and NIV). The users debate the extent to which the ESV was a reaction to other translations and the nuances of translation choices.

7. **Clarification of translation differences**: User Basileias corrects JohnChrysostom's assertion about the NIV updates, providing examples to show that the updated NIV does not take all renderings from the TNIV and NIVI wholesale.

8. **Acknowledgment of error and influence**: JohnChrysostom acknowledges the oversight and agrees that the NIV update was influenced by, but not identical to, the TNIV.

9. **Resolution of the history introduction**: Basileias concludes by aligning the history introduction of the article with the source from Crossway, which seems to resolve some of the earlier disputes.

The quality of the arguments presented in this discussion is generally high. The participants are engaged in a detailed and source-oriented debate, with a clear effort to maintain accuracy and neutrality. They provide specific examples, acknowledge errors, and show a willingness to update their positions based on new information. The discussion is coherent, relevant, and shows a good understanding of the subject matter.

However, there are moments where the arguments could benefit from more direct evidence rather than relying on interpretations of the sources. Additionally, the discussion could be more focused on the article's content rather than the broader debate about Bible translation philosophies, which, while related, may not be directly pertinent to the article's neutrality and accuracy.

Taking into account the depth of the discussion, the participants' engagement with the sources, and their willingness to correct and improve the article, the quality of the discussion is quite good.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.0.",8.0

Immigration

<user_id=Gaius Octavius Princeps>
The paragraph ""In 2011, British academics Matthew Goodwin, Robert Ford and David Cutts published a study revealing significant xenophobic and increasing Islamophobic elements in UKIP's strategy. They showed that the discourse of the Independence Party on immigration and national identity is similar to the one of British National Party (BNP), with the former's being gradually more moderate.""  They have not ""revealed"" nor ""showed"" anything. They have ""claimed"". Changed it to claimed. What is the reasoning of whoever thinks it should be ""revealed"" and ""showed""?

<user_id=Jordi22>
It seems blatantly POV to write ""showed"" and ""revealed"", especially in a study dealing with such subjective concepts as xenophobia and Islamophobia. The person who keeps writing it quite clearly has political agenda, for which Wikipedia is not the place.

<user_id=RJFF>
The findings of an academic study by established political scientists, published in a peer-reviewed journal cannot be dismissed as ""subjective interpretations"". Xenophobia and Islamophobia are not ""subjective concepts"", but established social science and political science terminology. That the academic study of independent scholars were pursuing a ""political agenda"" is a severe imputation, for which you do not provide any evidence at all.

<user_id=Gaius Octavius Princeps>
The findings were by Matthew Goodwin, who has been anti-ukip for as long as I can remember. Regardless of that fact, that is not why I dispute the use of ""shown and ""revealed"" but because it is blatantly POV. They have not Shown nor Revealed anything, they have Claimed.  No editor would seek to pass such POV language in the labour/conservative/lib dem pages and yet you feel it is appropriate here. If you want ""revealed"" and ""shown"" then show me another source that proves it is has indeed been ""revealed"", rather than being an unsubstantiated claim. Claimed is the only possible wording to be used here. If editors insist on reverting back to POV language then lets take this to a higher power

<user_id=Snowded>
in general we do not qualify properly referenced material.  Arguing that an academi. Is anti-ukip isn't the way things work.   We use the sources as they are, not as we would like them to be.  The use of 'claim' indicates a thought piece not a researched paper so it is equally POV.   If there is a counter source then we need to balance, but I don't see any.  Another phrasing would be ""a 2011 study demonstrated ..."" similar but possible better language.

<user_id=One Night In Hackney>
Indeed, it's more than enough that it's attributed already. The wording doesn't say whether the report is correct or not, merely what it revealed. The idea that increasing Islamaphobia can't be quantified is a ludicrous one. If, say for example in 2010 an organisation published one article criticising Islam yet in 2011 they published twenty that's increasing Islamaphobia. I note it's only material UKIP supporters don't like that requires labels such as ""claimed"". ''''

<user_id=Pjbeef>
I changed this to better reflect the article itself - the previous wording showed a misunderstanding of its meaning (either that or perhaps it hadn't been thoroughly read). Either way, it's an analysis of support for UKIP, more than the party's strategy. It says some policies are similar to those of the BNP, but doesn't equate them and makes the distinction between UKIP and the ""extreme right"" BNP (and that comparison forms a much smaller part of the report than the voting analysis). The sample size of the report (a population extrapolation of the YouGov online panel before the last European elections) doesn't damage the credibility of the research itself, but does mean that it can be seen in the context of ""revealing"" something, rather ""suggesting"" it, similar to the way opinion polls etc ""suggest"" something, rather than reveal it. Happy to discuss it.

<user_id=Emeraude>
I've reverted this. My reading of the article does not agree with yours, which is not to say that either of us is right or wrong, but it would be better to obtain consensus here before editing what is possibly a very contentious issue. You can see that from the above comments that the reporting of Goodwin ''et al'' has been discussed and some sort of consensus arrived at.

<user_id=Pjbeef>
The section now reads ""...claiming significant xenophobic and increasing Islamophobic elements in UKIP's strategy."" I note this wasn't the edit made by , but this has now gone from one extreme to another. Arguing the report 'claims' something implies it isn't properly researched - it is. But saying the report 'reveals' something is a naive interpretation of data gathered through opinion polls. That is not to deny them any credibility, but anything gathered through them needs to be set in the context of what they are; an extrapolation of the thoughts of a small sample of the population, onto the population at large. You would never hear references to polls ""revealing"" most of a country wants a change in government, for example. they would ""suggest it"", or words to that effect. I'm afraid I don't think four people can reach a consensus, and this issue clearly needs further discussion. I'm not making a comment on whether the research is somehow anti-UKIP, that's (mostly) irrelevant to its inclusion in this article.

<user_id=Emeraude>
I merely reverted to the ''status quo ante'', but I agree that neither ""reveal"" nor ""claim"" are quite adequate. Perhaps ""show"" or ""identify"" would be better verbs. (''....Matthew Goodwin, Robert Ford and David Cutts published a study identifying significant xenophobic and increasing Islamophobic elements in UKIP's strategy.'')

<user_id=Pjbeef>
I agree those words would be better (even though the authors themselves describe their research as ""suggesting"" its conclusions). Now to the representation of the report - the description in the article suggests the report is primarily about UKIP's strategy - when in fact it's nearly all an analysis of UKIP's voters, far far less about the strategy, and indeed where strategy is mentioned, it's most often cited from other research. This includes the line at the end about the BNP - which, when read in full, says ""As John and Margetts (2009: 501; also Borisyuk et al. 2007) observe, the BNP and UKIP adopt similar discourses on issues of immigration and national identity"" - this is not original research. It'd be far better to cite John and Margetts (2009: 501; also Borisyuk et al. 2007) here than to give others credit for their work. The main problem with the BNP line from my point of view is that it seems a strange line to pick out of the report, as most of it differentiates the two parties by describing the BNP as ""far right"". Perhaps a better line to use might be ""UKIP’s credentials as a legitimate party of right-wing protest over Europe may make it a ‘polite alternative’ for voters angry about rising immigration levels or elite corruption but who are repelled by the stigmatized image of the more extreme BNP"". Or the abstract could be used - ""UKIP is well positioned to recruit a broader and more enduring base of support than the BNP and become a significant vehicle of xenophobia and, more specifically, Islamophobia in modern Britain."" I am not an apologist for UKIP and am not making these suggestions for political reasons - they represent the content of the report much better than to suggest it is an analysis of the party's strategy, rather than an analysis of its supporters.

<user_id=RJFF>
As the editor who inserted the reference to this study in the first place, I find your argumentation reasonable and convincing. I agree with proceeding as you suggested.

<user_id=One Night In Hackney>
Could someone be a bit more specific on what the actual change to the text will be, since it seems to have changed in substance since the original edit? Right now the conversation seems to be dealing with discussion about the sources which is all well and good, but I'd prefer to move it on to a proposal to change the text based on them? Thanks. ''''

<user_id=Pjbeef>
How about something along the lines of ""In 2011, the British academics Matthew Goodwin, Robert Ford and David Cutts published a study suggesting that xenophobia and dissatisfaction with mainstream parties are important drivers of support for UKIP, along with Euroscepticism. They concluded that ""UKIP is well positioned to recruit a broader and more enduring base of support than the BNP and become a significant vehicle of xenophobia and, more specifically, Islamophobia in modern Britain."" ""

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Use of Terminology**: The initial argument revolves around the use of the words ""revealed"" and ""showed"" versus ""claimed."" The distinction is important as ""revealed"" and ""showed"" imply a definitive conclusion, while ""claimed"" suggests a possibility or opinion. This is a valid point of contention in academic writing, especially on a platform like Wikipedia that values neutral point of view.

2. **Academic Credibility**: RJFF argues that the study in question is published in a peer-reviewed journal by established political scientists, which lends it credibility. This is a strong argument in favor of treating the study's findings as more than mere claims.

3. **Allegations of Bias**: Gaius Octavius Princeps raises concerns about potential bias from one of the authors, Matthew Goodwin. While this could be relevant, no evidence is provided to support the claim that Goodwin's alleged bias has influenced the study's findings. Without such evidence, this argument is weaker.

4. **Interpretation of Research**: Pjbeef points out that the study is an analysis of support for UKIP rather than a direct analysis of the party's strategy. This is an important distinction that affects how the study's findings should be presented.

5. **Language Precision**: Emeraude and Pjbeef discuss alternative wording such as ""identifying"" or ""suggesting,"" which may be more neutral and accurate. This shows a constructive approach to resolving the issue.

6. **Contextualization of Data**: Pjbeef also notes that the data from opinion polls should be contextualized appropriately, as they represent extrapolations rather than direct revelations. This is a nuanced understanding of how such data should be treated in reporting.

7. **Consensus Building**: Throughout the discussion, there is an effort to reach a consensus on the appropriate wording, which is a positive aspect of the dialogue.

8. **Focus on Source Representation**: The participants discuss how to best represent the source material in a way that is true to its content and conclusions. This demonstrates a commitment to accuracy and fidelity to the source.

Overall, the discussion is characterized by a focus on factual accuracy, neutrality, and appropriate representation of the source material. The participants engage in a constructive dialogue, with some providing strong arguments based on academic standards and the principles of Wikipedia. There is a clear effort to reach a consensus and improve the quality of the content.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.",8.0

Tracy Spiridakos

<user_id=AussieLegend>
I really don't understand the edit war that has gone on today over whether Tracy Spiridakos was a guest or recurring in season 4. She was in multiple episodes of the season in the same role and, IIRC, the same story arc, which clearly marks her role as recurring. To claim she wasn't is quite ridiculous.

<user_id=BattleshipMan>
Look, there's an issue about the status of guest and recurring. Some of us view this as guest because episode appearances below five episodes is considered guest, others say she's recurring because she appeared in three episodes which they considered one episode appearances is guest starring. That's what it is about.

<user_id=AussieLegend>
There has never been a guideline that defines the number of episodes required for recurring status, and for good reason. Technically, only two episodes are required to make a character recurring. If a guest star appears in the same role twice they are technically a recurring character. If they appear twice but in different roles they are a recurring actor. However, if an actor appears as the same character 3 times across a series run, in different seasons, that's not necessarily a recurring role. On the other hand, if they appear 3 times within a season, that is normally recurring. And then you have characters like ""Althea"" from ''The Big Bang Theory'' who is portrayed by the same actress and is always a nurse but appears in different situaations each time. She has been in 6 episode, including the unaired pilot, always in different seasons and yet is classed as a recurring character. We don't fix the number of episodes because it can't be applied consistently. That's the way it has always been. Note also that an actor be credited as a guest but appear in a recurring role and when an actor appears in 3 episodes in one season and then promoted to a starring role in the next, that's definitely a recurring role.

<user_id=TheDoctorWho>
I agree that she is recurring especially since the episodes were all 3 back to back (Not spread out throughout the season) and she played a very important role in all 3 (as a member of the team).

<user_id=IJBall>
No, Aussie, that's not what TVCAST says. And your opinion alone doesn't get to define ""3 episodes"" as ""recurring"". There have been ''multiple'' discussions on this topic at WP:TV over the years, and there is a significant contingent in WP:TV that feels you need to be in somewhere between 4–6 episodes to truly qualify as ""recurring"". Further, as there is actually contradictory sources as to whether the role was ""guest"" or ""recurring"", the best course of action here is to go with the more conservative ""guest role"" interpretation, esp. at a BLP like Tracy Spiridakos.   •

<user_id=TheDoctorWho>
Why should we go with your ''conservative'' opinion when sources contradict when WP:TVCAST clearly states ""If reliable sources cannot adequately distinguish between recurring or guest roles, then local consensus should determine their status.""?

<user_id=IJBall>
Yes, and at Tracy Spiridakos the consensus is against you. Additionally, at BLP's the conservative option should always be the norm.   •

<user_id=TheDoctorWho>
how is consensus against me when two people say she's recurring and two say she's a guest? And also we're not just looking at a BLP were also looking at this article and its associated character page.

<user_id=AussieLegend>
- I am well aware of that, having been editing TV articles for 12 years. I'm afraid that your opinion hasn't been supported by the numerous discussions that I've had, and I'll note that your own opinion isn't supported by WP:TVCAST.
- Your interpretation is not conservative, it's just an interpretation.
- No, two editors fighting another is not consensus. Consensus is determined based on the arguments, not on numbers. You should know that by now.

<user_id=IJBall>
Incorrect: see this – no one in that discussion was clamoring to call three episodes ""recurring"", and the guideline was ultimately written to leave some flexability, but to make it clear that two episode and even more than two episodes is not necessarily ""recurring"". In fact, there is a substantial opinion on WP:TV that 4–6 episodes should be needed to be considered recurring, which you should be aware of if you've been participating in these discussion for ""years"". I myself have seen more than one discussion on this, and there is pretty much always a contingent of WP:TV editors in these discussions that wants to see 4, 5 or 6 episodes used as the benchmark for recurring.   •

<user_id=BattleshipMan>
I think three episode appearances should be considered guest starring. We have a huge number of actors who appeared in three episodes in a season in various shows. That sounds to the majority of us that they should considered a guest stars. Recurring should be around at least 5 or thereabouts. One more thing, you keep forgetting to add the four tlides in your comment to sign your comment posts.

<user_id=TheDoctorWho>
I'm having a little trouble understanding how my opinion isn't supported by WP:TVCAST. The guideline about two or three appearances does not necessarily mean a recurring role is very vague.  That means it could be a recurring role but also may not be a recurring role. Which is why I thought it turned around and mentioned sources. Which is where it says if sources can't adequately distinguish consensus should determine. So all I'm trying to do is follow the guidelines. Because some of us believe she is recurring, others of us believe she is guest and sources clearly DO NOT distinguish (some of them say recurring others say guest). And  where is your view on this? Earlier it sounded like you were calling her recurring but here in your most recent message it sounded like you were calling her a guest.

<user_id=TheDoctorWho>
Well this is exactly where that ""flexibility"" needs to come in. I know is completely unrelated but what if a season had more or less than the general 23-25 episodes per season. If a season had 30 episodes how many episodes would be needed than? 7-8? Or if a season had 12-15 episodes what would be recurring then 3-4? That's exactly why there should never be a set number on how many episodes they require to be recurring (and clearly there is not because of that ""flexibility"").

<user_id=TheDoctorWho>
I also don't understand why we're completely ignoring RELIABLE SOURCES? I know I keep saying this but there was a portion of WP:TVCAST that was set up EXACTLY for this type of situation.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Understanding of Guidelines**: All participants demonstrate a basic understanding of the Wikipedia guidelines, particularly WP:TVCAST, which is relevant to the discussion. They are debating the interpretation of these guidelines, which shows engagement with the rules of the platform.

2. **Use of Evidence**: Participants are using evidence to support their claims, such as referencing past discussions, the number of episodes an actor appears in, and the definitions of ""guest"" and ""recurring"" roles. However, there is a disagreement on how to interpret this evidence, which is a normal part of a healthy debate.

3. **Consensus Building**: There is an attempt to build consensus, with participants referencing the need for a consensus and the process for determining it. However, the discussion has not yet reached a consensus, which is not necessarily a reflection of poor argument quality but rather an ongoing debate.

4. **Respect for Other Opinions**: The participants are generally respectful of each other's opinions, even when they disagree. They are engaging with each other's arguments rather than dismissing them outright.

5. **Clarity and Coherence**: The arguments are mostly clear and coherent. Each participant is articulating their point of view and responding to others' points. There is some confusion about the interpretation of guidelines and past discussions, but this is part of the process of clarifying complex issues.

6. **Relevance**: The arguments are relevant to the issue at hand, which is the classification of Tracy Spiridakos' role in a particular season of a TV show. The participants are focused on this issue and not bringing in irrelevant information.

7. **Factual Accuracy**: The participants are discussing the facts of the case, such as the number of episodes the actress appeared in and the context of her appearances. There is some disagreement over how to interpret these facts, but the facts themselves are not in dispute.

8. **Rhetorical Strategies**: The participants are using various rhetorical strategies, such as appealing to past discussions, guidelines, and the importance of reliable sources. These strategies are appropriate for the discussion and contribute to the argument quality.

Overall, the discussion is robust, with participants engaging with the guidelines and each other's arguments. There is a clear effort to understand and apply the rules of Wikipedia to a specific case, and while there is disagreement, this is a natural part of the consensus-building process on the platform.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Overemphasis on Gaffes

<user_id=William JJ>
I can agree that the ""potatoe"" gaffe belongs in the article.  But going beyond that is overdoing it.  Obama has also made a fair number of gaffes, and they are not mentioned in his article at all.  In light of that precedent, I think including the ""potatoe"" gaffe goes far enough.

<user_id=William JJ>
Hellooooooo; Earth to anyone interested  if no one posts here, I will assume that my recent edit removing references to gaffes should be included, undo the revert, and insist that my version has been approved on the talk page.

<user_id=Doug Weller>
Quayle is probably best known today for his gaffes. Your version has not been approved on the talk page, and silence is not consent. Please don't remove the material again. Thanks.

<user_id=William JJ>
Well, according to BRD, the third step is ""discuss"".  How can you discuss an issue if one side is silent?  This still seems undue.  For example, Obama has had quite a few gaffes, and there have been jokes about TOTUS, but neither appears in his article.

<user_id=Nomoskedasticity>
I agree with the judgment that gaffes are what Quayle is best know for.  If you feel that the same is true for Obama, then perhaps raise it on that talk page.

<user_id=Canoe1967>
Just a thought. Is there a 'political gaffes' article yet? We could just lump them all there for anyone that wants to see how many others there are and compare on their own?

<user_id=William JJ>
I'm not aware of one.  I like the idea, though.

<user_id=Canoe1967>
I started the article. We need to make it acceptable before it gets deleted though.

<user_id=Nomoskedasticity>
It won't mean deleting material from this article.

<user_id=William JJ>
That's a separate issue.

<user_id=Arzel>
That he is known for some gaffes does not mean that he is defined by them.  As such the VP section is largely a BLP violation presenting undue weight on his misstatements.

<user_id=Arzel>
Ha, you are funny.  You know there is no way in hell that the protectorate of Obama will allow this kind of crap on the Obama article, why even make the statement.

<user_id=Nomoskedasticity>
Perhaps you could tell us what else he is known for  and present the sources that substantiate any assertions along those lines.

<user_id=Tarc>
I'd think in this case I'd have to say that Dan Quayle is indeed primarily defined by his clumsy speech and word choices of the past.  We're going on 25 years now from when it all happened and it is still a frequent citation, not anything he did in COngress or as a VP.

<user_id=BlueMoonlet>
Hi.  I was just stopping by, saw the tag, and thought I would offer an evaluation.  In the Vice Presidency section, I count three paragraphs detailing Quayle's gaffes, two more on the Murphy Brown speech (which was not a gaffe and is not presented as one; note the supporting quote from Bergen herself), and three short paragraphs at the beginning describing other aspects of his Vice Presidency.  The article overall has something like 20 paragraphs (that's an estimate, not a count).
My judgment is that the three paragraphs on gaffes are appropriate.  All of the items listed are well-known, and an article on Quayle would be incomplete without them.  If you are concerned about WP:UNDUE weight, then I would suggest you add more material about other things he did as Vice President.   /

<user_id=William JJ>
Not a bad idea, actually.

<user_id=Ranskip>
I agree that the section of this article describing gaffes is accurate and appropriate as written, and may even understate the issue.  The events cited are well known facts, and many additional incidents took place that are not cited.  Removal of any part of the present article would be distorting truth.  Dan Quayle’s intelligence and competence to serve were serious issues to many Americans in the 1992 election, including many in his own party.  This was among the primary factors attributed to the Bush administration’s failure to win re-election. [Ranskip - 22 October 2012]  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

1. **Argument about Precedent and Fairness**: <user_id=William JJ> argues that since Obama's gaffes are not mentioned in his article, it would be fair to treat Quayle's article similarly. This argument appeals to consistency across articles, which is a reasonable point in terms of editorial fairness.

2. **Argument about Notability of Gaffes**: <user_id=Doug Weller> and <user_id=Nomoskedasticity> argue that Quayle is best known for his gaffes, suggesting that this is a significant aspect of his public perception and therefore merits inclusion. This is a strong argument because it is based on the notability and relevance of the information to the subject's public image.

3. **Silence is Not Consent**: <user_id=Doug Weller> points out that silence on the talk page does not equate to agreement with the edit. This is a valid point in the context of Wikipedia's consensus-building process.

4. **BRD (Bold, Revert, Discuss) Cycle**: <user_id=William JJ> references the BRD cycle, which is a common Wikipedia process for handling disputes. However, the user seems to misunderstand that the discussion phase requires active participation and not just an absence of response.

5. **Creation of a Separate Article**: <user_id=Canoe1967> suggests creating a 'political gaffes' article to house all such information. This is a constructive suggestion that could help balance the presentation of gaffes across different political figures.

6. **Undue Weight and BLP Concerns**: <user_id=Arzel> raises the issue of undue weight and potential violation of the Biography of Living Persons (BLP) policy. This is an important consideration, as Wikipedia has strict guidelines about presenting information fairly and without undue emphasis, especially for living individuals.

7. **Request for Additional Notable Aspects**: <user_id=Nomoskedasticity> asks for other notable aspects of Quayle's career to be presented with sources, which is a reasonable request to balance the article's content.

8. **Historical Perspective**: <user_id=Tarc> and <user_id=Ranskip> provide a historical perspective, noting that Quayle's gaffes are still frequently cited and were a significant factor in public perception, which supports the inclusion of the gaffes in the article.

9. **Suggestion to Expand Other Content**: <user_id=BlueMoonlet> suggests expanding the article with more information about Quayle's vice presidency to address concerns about undue weight. This is a constructive approach that would improve the article's balance.

Overall, the arguments presented show a mix of concerns about fairness, notability, Wikipedia's editorial processes, and the balance of content. Most participants provide reasoned arguments, and there is a constructive suggestion to improve the article's balance. The discussion is generally coherent and relevant, with participants citing Wikipedia policies and guidelines to support their points.

Haunted

<user_id=Yutsi>
Can we remove the pseudoscience and extensive coverage of ""haunted"" areas in the subsections of Alcatraz_Cellhouse#Prison_life_and_the_cells? You can't verify that stuff, and the most that I think would be appropriate would be briefly stating that the penitentiary has a reputation for allegedly being haunted. ❤   / ( 偉特 )

<user_id=Dr. Blofeld>
If you read it is says reported. I think its very relevant, the info is verifiable in multiple reliable sources, that's good enough for me.♦

<user_id=99.137.48.242>
There is nothing ""reliable"" about a Web site full of ""ghost stories."" Mythical, nonsensical tosh has no place in an encyclopedia, and anything beyond what Yutsi said goes ridiculously into the direction of WP:UNDUE.

<user_id=Dr. Blofeld>
No, you can't verify that something is haunted but you can verify something which is reputedly haunted; there are even whole books on the ghosts of Alcatraz. It is cited by numerous reliable sources as ""reputedly haunted"". We don't claim it to be haunted but are merely reporting what has been reported in multiple places elsewhere. To not mention anything of it is wrong given the coverage on it. Blocks A-C could use information about the time as a prison though.♦

<user_id=140.182.57.175>
I don't think you understand what a ""personal attack"" prohibited by WP:NPA is. Making comments about the veracity of claims is not a prohibited ""personal attack"" and I have not made comments about any contributors. ('''Comment on the content, not the contributor.''') I repeat, you have no right to repeatedly remove comments from a talk page. This article gives significant undue weight to nonsensical ""paranormal"" baloney that has zero serious scientific credibility. One brief mention is perhaps warranted of these pseudoscientific claims, but not endless repetition of ghost stories. Now let's stop the edit-warring and hash out what a (small) section on these claims should look like.

<user_id=140.182.57.175>
For example, I am quite sure someone, somewhere has made claims about the White House having ghosts. There is not a ''single'' mention of ""ghosts"" or ""haunting"" on the White House Wikipedia page - for good reason, and that's because those claims have no place in an encyclopedia entry.

<user_id=Dr. Blofeld>
UNDUE? It barely mentions it. Always makes me laugh to see a newbie citing UNDUE and wiki guidelines, sock  puppet from Bloomington, Indiana!! Given the wealth of coverage with whole books dedicated to it I think this is perfectly acceptable to mention, although one could argue the alleged hauntings would be better but in a single paragraph at the bottom. Read Reportedly haunted locations in Washington, D.C..♦

<user_id=Polarscribe (usurped)>
That's an entirely separate article. The main White House article has no mentions of them. I would agree to splitting off all mentions in regards to this site into a separate article. Reportedly haunted locations in San Francisco has significant coverage already, and at best this subject deserves a single link in the main article.

<user_id=Polarscribe (usurped)>
Interesting, now who's making personal attacks, referring to the contributor and not the content? I am not a sock puppet, but I am plenty knowledgeable about Wikipedia, and under a former account, a retired administrator. But that has nothing to do with this particular dispute, and neither does my current location.

<user_id=Dr. Blofeld>
Reportedly haunted locations in San Francisco was written long after this was written. Retired administrator? Or banned administrator? I spent at least 10 hours of my time writing this article, heavily researching it and trying to write a good article which is valuable for wikipedia. I do not have time for arrogant professors who make snarky edit summaries belittling it. There are entire books existing on the ghosts of Alcatraz not to mention substantial coverage in multiple book sources. In fact I could probably write Reported hauntings of Alcatraz as a full article, in fact I think I'll do that tomorrow. The only point I can see is to put all mention of ""psuedo science"" into a bottom paragraph.♦

<user_id=Polarscribe (usurped)>
Wow. Seriously? You accuse me of personal attacks, and call me a ""banned administrator"" and an ""arrogant professor""? More false, ridiculous personal attacks. I respect your efforts, but you do not own this article and I disagree with your focus.

<user_id=Dr. Blofeld>
The only point I can see is to put all mention of ""pseudo science"" into a bottom paragraph. As an encyclopedia it is not our duty to be scientists and make judge judgements, we are here to report existing information which is very well documented in books and newspapers. It might be rubbish but multiple RS write about its hauntings so its good enough for me.♦

<user_id=Polarscribe (usurped)>
Wrong. We do not treat fringe viewpoints as equally worthy. The idea that any place can be ""haunted"" by ""ghosts"" is fringe. Again, see White House - not a single mention in that article.

<user_id=Polarscribe (usurped)>
If you don't want to work through consensus, I'll just have to GAR this thing. If you want to write 10 pages on ludicrous ghost story nonsense, be my guest, but it has virtually no place in the primary encyclopedia article about a federal penitentiary-turned-museum.

<user_id=Polarscribe (usurped)>
Furthermore, I demand that you retract your false personal attacks. Do you realize how ridiculous you sound, criticizing me for alleged personal attacks and then turning around and going ''ad hominem''? Seriously, it's hilarious.

<user_id=Polarscribe (usurped)>
I have created a separate section entitled ""Paranormal claims"" and linked it to the current article on reportedly-haunted locations in San Francisco, which contains all significant information on the matter. If you wish to create a separate article on the phenomenon, then that would be an appropriate link as well.

<user_id=Polarscribe (usurped)>
I also added significantly to the ""Reportedly haunted"" article, from information that was removed from this article.

<user_id=Polarscribe (usurped)>
Specifically, the issue here in WP:FRINGE is this: ''2. Generally considered pseudoscience: Theories which have a following, such as astrology, but which are generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community may properly contain that information and may be categorized as pseudoscience.'' Reports of ""ghosts"" or ""hauntings"" are generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community, and as per the Fringe theories guideline, should '''not''' be given significant prominence in an article.

<user_id=SchroCat>
I have reverted the deleted entries. Perhaps you could discuss this here before you start edit warring over a few very minor points? Once you have a consensus to remove, that is the time to remove it, not before. -   •

<user_id=Polarscribe (usurped)>
That's quite simply wrong. You're reinserting fringe lunacy into an article where it has absolutely no place. There is not a single shred of scientific evidence that ghosts exist. Any claims to the contrary are fringe theories deserving of nothing more than a brief mention. Now I remember why I quit the first time.

<user_id=Polarscribe (usurped)>
Also, if you'd spend three minutes looking at something before you revert it, you'd realize that the citations you reverted go to the exact same document - the link I put in simply goes to an OFFICIAL copy of that document hosted on a U.S. Government Web site rather than a terrible white-on-black ad-filled version. The document in question is the [www.nps.gov/alca/photosmultimedia/upload/TheRock-web.pdf National Park Service Historical Resource Study] conducted by the NPS about Alcatraz Island. It is a highly reliable source and we should connect to the official version.

<user_id=Polarscribe (usurped)>
You reinserted a link to a Web site entitled ""Psychic Phone Readings"" - http://www.pastlifetimes.net/psychic_phone_readings_ghost_story_alcatraz_ghosts.htm - that is, almost by definition, '''not''' a reliable source.

<user_id=SchroCat>
You are allowing your own POV to cloud an issue. There are valid sources cited in this article and removing them based on your own POV and without getting a consensus is simply the wrong approach on Wiki. Furthermore, please do not edit war, try and remeber WP:BRD. The D is for ""discuss"", not ""ignore what the sources tell me and hammer home my own POV regardless of others"". -   •

<user_id=Polarscribe (usurped)>
An article written by psychics is not a reliable source for any factual claim. That you don't understand that is mind-boggling.

<user_id=SchroCat>
I have not said that particular source is reliable, so you can knock off the ''ad hominem'' comments. I reverted the deletions as a whole because you were edit warring over something that needs to be discussed '''first''', not fought over. -   •

<user_id=Shearonink>
Really?  there's no mentions of the ghost that Churchill saw or any of the other published sightings in the main article?  I'm  surprised that all the sightings by prominent people that have appeared in reliable sources aren't in the article or at the very least that there isn't ""See also"" linkage to Lincoln's Ghost and Reportedly haunted locations in Washington, D.C.#White House.  Thanks for mentioning it.

<user_id=Dr. Blofeld>
@ Bloomington professor, you removed the content without at least trying to verify it in more reliable sources. We'd show you a lot more respect if you returned it and stopped your snotty nosed comments like "" That you don't understand that is mind-boggling."" We are both intelligent individuals and have contributed many FA quality articles to wikipedia, so why not start showing us a little respect eh? If you weren't so aggressive and presumptuous with your approach on this, treating us like dullards, you'd find you'd be more likely to get somewhere. Your tone of voice on this comes across as highly condescending, as if we know nothing and you know it all. Yes, it comes across as pure arrogance. If you don't want to be perceived in this way, I recommend you start treating others in the way you'd expect yourself to be treated. ♦

<user_id=Dr. Blofeld>
The idea that ghosts exist is fringe nonsense and 80 dozen references to it as if they are real do not belong in a historical article. Your views on ghosts itself is  gross POV. You dismiss it as nonsense, yet the purpose of life and indeed the idea that people are spiritual beings we can't possibly know. There are an awful lot of unexplained mysteries surrounding life and so many people have reported phenomena which they can't explain that one cannot arrogantly dismiss them as complete nonsense. I can't prove that people are not spiritual beings which may manifest after they've left their body anymore than I can't prove the existence of God and heaven and hell. Alcatraz, folklore, legend, maybe, its what ''thousands'' of people have reported and which hundreds of writers have written about so whether there are actually ghosts in Alcatraz or not it is not up to us to judge, but to report what has clearly been reported in masses of sources. No kidding, it would be like me editing the Islam article and removing any mention of Allah or the Christianity article removing any mention of God because I can't literally prove he exists; science doesn't recognize him so therefore its automatically nonsense? I doubt quite a few things in regards to religions but that's my opinion and my opinion only, I can't dispute the fact that multiple reliable sources document it and many people are convinced its true. It is not up to us as an encyclopedia to judge if the reports are fabricated or not, but to look at what reliable sources choose to write about which makes a topic noteworthy. It is a ''fact'' that Alcatraz is widely documented and claimed to be haunted. And you say my focus is on nonsense, when the amount mentioning paranormal activity amounted to just a few sentences and a relatively small section at the end of the article which seems appropriate. ♦

How about you stop calling me ""Bloomington professor?""

",0,"The discussion revolves around the inclusion of ""haunted"" content in the Alcatraz_Cellhouse#Prison_life_and_the_cells Wikipedia article. The main points of contention are the relevance and verifiability of paranormal claims, the application of Wikipedia's guidelines on due weight (WP:UNDUE) and fringe theories (WP:FRINGE), and the appropriate representation of such content in the article.

Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Relevance of Paranormal Claims**: User Yutsi suggests that the extensive coverage of haunted areas is not verifiable and should be reduced to a brief mention. This is a reasonable argument, as encyclopedic content should be verifiable and based on reliable sources.

2. **Verifiability and Reliable Sources**: Dr. Blofeld argues that the haunted reputation is verifiable through multiple reliable sources, including books dedicated to the subject. This is a valid point, as Wikipedia allows for the inclusion of content that is well-documented in reliable sources, even if the content itself is about fringe or pseudoscientific topics.

3. **Application of WP:UNDUE and WP:FRINGE**: User 99.137.48.242 and Polarscribe (usurped) argue that giving extensive coverage to paranormal claims gives undue weight to fringe theories, which is against Wikipedia's guidelines. This is a strong argument, as Wikipedia's guidelines caution against giving fringe theories prominence comparable to mainstream information.

4. **Comparison with Other Articles**: Polarscribe (usurped) compares the situation to the White House article, which does not mention ghosts despite similar claims existing. This comparison is used to argue that such content should not be given significant prominence. This is a relevant point, as it highlights the need for consistency in how Wikipedia articles treat similar content.

5. **Personal Attacks and Ownership of Content**: The discussion devolves into accusations of personal attacks and ownership of content, which detracts from the quality of the argumentation. Dr. Blofeld's reference to the time spent researching and writing the article suggests an emotional investment that may be clouding objective judgment.

6. **Consensus and Edit Warring**: SchroCat and Shearonink remind participants to seek consensus and avoid edit warring, which is a procedural point in line with Wikipedia's collaborative editing model.

7. **Factual Accuracy and Scientific Consensus**: Polarscribe (usurped) emphasizes the lack of scientific evidence for ghosts and the classification of such claims as pseudoscience. This is a compelling argument for limiting the coverage of paranormal claims in the article.

Overall, the discussion includes valid points on both sides regarding the inclusion of content based on reliable sources and the application of Wikipedia's guidelines on due weight and fringe theories. However, the quality of the discussion is diminished by instances of personal attacks, failure to maintain a neutral point of view, and a lack of focus on achieving consensus. The arguments that emphasize adherence to Wikipedia's guidelines and the importance of scientific consensus are particularly strong and coherent.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Time crystals

<user_id=Dirac66>
Last week's edits on time crystals misstate the connection to the article topic. The sources cited (or at least Cowen, Powell, and Gibney which I can access) confirm that time crystals violate time translation symmetry. They also add that time crystals are a type of perpetual motion. But they do not add that time crystals violate the conservation of energy. In fact Cowen states that ""This type of perpetual motion machine would not violate any known physical law because no energy could be extracted from the system without first adding energy."", and Gibney says ""Time crystals are hypothetical structures that pulse without requiring any energy"". The Time crystal article provides a more correct statement in its Thermodynamics section. I will attempt to revise the sentence in this article.

<user_id=Sparkyscience>
Sorry but this is not correct: time translation symmetry defines conservation of energy, thus if a system violates time translation symmetry it violates conservation of energy by definition. When we talk about ""laws of physics"" what we really mean is the symmetries of equations. As wilzciek states coyly in his original paper "" Fields or particles in the presence of a time crystal background will be subject to energy-changing processes, analogous to crystalline Umklapp processes. In either case the apparent non-conservation is in reality a transfer to the background.""  . While the experiments performed thus far are driven by lasers, in principle a time crystal can be driven by the quantum vacuum at absolute zero i.e. empty space. In fact it is this is the same type of perpetual motion / broken symmetry as say that of the spin of an electron. The concept of energy doesn't really apply to these nonlinear systems for the same reason it doesn't really apply in general relativity.

<user_id=Weburbia>
,  is right and the wilzciek quote makes this clear. The word ""apparent"" before ""non-conservation"" is to indicate that there is not really any non-conservation. The equations for the time crystal may not have time translation symmetry but this is only because the crystal is being treated as a fixed background. If the dynamics of the background are also included then the underlying equations have time-symmetry and energy conservation holds with energy being transferred to and from the background. Actually the situation in general relativity is exactly the same and energy is conserved there too. I don't think time-crystals should be discussed here at all and certainly not in the opening section. It would be better to clarify the status of energy conservation for time-crystals on their own page

<user_id=Dirac66>
, I agree that the non-conservation is only apparent as per Wilczek's paper. But that is not what this Wikipedia article now says. The statement in the intro that ""new states of matter violate ... the conservation of energy"" can be taken by a naïve reader to mean that scientists have recently discovered how to ""violate"" the conservation of energy. So some change to the article is needed please, in order to explain that the effect is only apparent and is driven by the quantum vacuum. If my version is unsatisfactory, could one of you two please insert a better one?
I also agree that this topic should not be in the intro where it may confuse beginning readers just starting to learn about conservation of energy. But I do think it should have a section further down for more advanced readers who have heard the news about time crystals and want to see what this article says about them. As I said above, the Time crystal article already provides a more correct statement in its Thermodynamics section.

<user_id=Geroniminor>
What's this about 'time crystals'?  They may be a real concept, but not relevant here.   Looks like a neologism trying to draw attention... just one of countless concepts that, in the end, obey energy conservation.

<user_id=Weburbia>
I have removed the section about time crystals because it is clearly not a violation of energy conservation as pointed out by . I tend to agree with  that this is a neolgism and too specific to be included here. This seems to be the result of a misleading headline mentioning perpetual motion. If someone thinks this merits a mention on this page I suggest they draft a short section for discussion here before including it in the main article.

<user_id=Sparkyscience>
I wrote the majority of the time crystal article in its current form, including the thermodynamics section in this edit here . The thermodynamics section is not ideal as it was written some time ago and treats the time crystal system as an equilibrium system (which have been proven to be impossible), the time crystals discovered most definitely partake in energy processes, but the current thermodynamics section is unfortuately one of the few sources in the literature that directly address the issue (ie. laws of thermodynamics) head on at this current time. In any normal sense, time crystals, as discovered, violate conservation of energy, and they are the first state of matter known to do so. They are therefore, obviously, an important discovery (possible Nobel prize next year? Things have been handed out for less...). Yes if you take the background into account symmetry is restored as in GR, but I agree with Sean Carrol here in his article titled ""Energy is not conserved""  ""I personally think it’s better to forget about the so-called “energy of the gravitational field” and just admit that energy is not conserved, for two reasons..."" No average person includes empty space when considering conservation laws, nor will they understand the key point if we do include it. All nonconservations can be viewed as a transfer to the vacuum but we don't usually claim that ""spontaneous symmetry breaking"" isn't really symmetry breaking at all!...Time crystals ""bend the cast-iron laws of thermodynamics"" .

<user_id=Sparkyscience>
I don't know how you can treat research published by multiple groups in ''Nature''  and reported in every major scientific outlet a negolism.      I can understand editors caution over systems that claim to break the laws of physics (by which we mean a symmetry), but this is the real deal.

<user_id=Sparkyscience>
What is most key is that readers of ""conservation of energy"" understand the domain of where this law of physics applies - namely closed linear systems that have time translational symmetry. Where this is not the case, in open nonlinear systems, like high energy plasmas , gravitating systems  and time crystals the conservation of energy does not apply. I would argue time crystals are probably the best example here, because in others there is the temptation to think energy is ""borrowed"" from somewhere else, which is not the case. The universe is not a zero-sum game.

<user_id=Weburbia>
You seem to be claiming that energy conservation is only for linear static systems. Energy conservation works for all systems, linear or non-linear, where the dynamical equations are time-translation invariant, including time crystals and general relativity. Anything that changes breaks translation symmetry dynamically. What is special about the time crystal is that it changes while in its ground state, i.e. time-translation is broken spontaneously. This does not mean that energy conservation is violated. It is the equations that need to be invariant, not the solution. Ordinary crystals spontaneously break translation symmetry but they don't violate momentum conservation. You can't use crystals to generate a reactionless engine and you can't use time crystals to generate energy, nor is energy conservation violated in any other way. To be able to say something in wikipedia you need a reliable source. None of the sources cited (reliable and otherwise) say that energy is not conserved.

<user_id=Sparkyscience>
crystalline systems are not invariant under arbitrary translations, therefore, strictly speaking, momentum is not conserved.""
Crystals do not conserve momentum. This is basic textbook physics stuff. Thats why rather then talk about momentum in crystals we talk about Quasimomentum. And Umklapp scattering demonstrates quite clearly what momentum violations looks like. Without momentum violations key properties of crystals would not be present.
With time crystals the same principle applies (we use the term ""quasienergy"" instead of energy because technically energy is not conserved). When i talk about linear i mean the ""linear equations"", sorry for not making that clear, where you can separate variables, i'm not referring to the value of the equations. i.e. per what i wrote here:""Symmetries apply to the equations that govern the physical laws rather than the initial conditions, values or magnitudes of the equations themselves and state that the laws remain unchanged under a transformation. . With nonlinear i am referring to equations where you cannot separate variables.

<user_id=Weburbia>
If you treat a crystal as a fundamental structure without continuous translation symmetry then the system will have only quasimomentum, but in the real world the crystal is made of atoms that are bound by forces governed by equations with continuous translational invariance, so when all processes are taken into account momentum must be conserved. Noether's Theorems are completely general and work for all physical systems derived from a Lagrangian principle. There are no extra assumptions such as that variables need to be separable.

",1,"The discussion revolves around the concept of time crystals and their relation to the conservation of energy. The participants are debating whether time crystals violate the conservation of energy and if they should be mentioned in the context of an article on energy conservation.

1. **Dirac66** starts by pointing out inaccuracies in the article, emphasizing that time crystals do not violate the conservation of energy according to the sources cited. Dirac66 suggests revising the article to reflect this.

2. **Sparkyscience** counters by stating that time translation symmetry is directly related to the conservation of energy, and thus, time crystals, by violating this symmetry, also violate energy conservation. Sparkyscience refers to Wilczek's paper and the concept of energy in nonlinear systems and general relativity.

3. **Weburbia** agrees with Dirac66 that the non-conservation is only apparent and that when the dynamics of the background are included, energy conservation holds. Weburbia also suggests that the topic of time crystals might not be relevant to the article's introduction and should be clarified on the time crystals' own page.

4. **Geroniminor** expresses skepticism about the relevance of time crystals to the article, suggesting that it might be a neologism and not a violation of energy conservation.

5. **Sparkyscience** defends the significance of time crystals, citing their coverage in scientific literature and media. Sparkyscience argues that time crystals are an important discovery and that they do partake in energy processes, which might be seen as a violation of energy conservation in a non-traditional sense.

6. **Weburbia** reiterates that energy conservation applies to all systems with time-translation invariant equations, including time crystals and general relativity. Weburbia also points out that reliable sources do not state that energy is not conserved.

7. **Sparkyscience** explains the concept of quasimomentum in crystals and quasienergy in time crystals, arguing that in certain contexts, strict conservation laws do not apply.

8. **Weburbia** concludes by stating that in the real world, where crystals are made of atoms governed by equations with continuous translational invariance, momentum—and by extension, energy—must be conserved according to Noether's Theorems.

The quality of the arguments presented varies. Some participants, like Dirac66 and Weburbia, provide clear and concise arguments supported by references to physical laws and theorems, such as Noether's Theorems. They also emphasize the importance of context and the overall framework of physical laws. Sparkyscience provides a more speculative viewpoint, suggesting that time crystals represent a fundamental shift in our understanding of energy conservation, but the arguments are less grounded in established physics and lack consensus in the scientific community.

Overall, the discussion is robust, with participants providing detailed explanations and references to scientific literature. The debate is focused on the interpretation of physical laws and the implications of new scientific discoveries, which is a complex and nuanced topic. The participants are engaged and provide thoughtful counterarguments, which contributes to the quality of the discussion.

Teen Vogue article fails to prove its claim so is a bad source

<user_id=DeadEyeSmile>
http://www.teenvogue.com/story/trump-susan-rice-whataboutism-thigh-high-politics

<user_id=DeadEyeSmile>
I have removed the Teen Vogue article because it does not show an example of Whataboutism. It claims it does but it does not support those claims.

<user_id=DeadEyeSmile>
Here is the premise:
Trump is working hard to sensationalize the implications of Rice’s unmasking, specifically amping up its connection to his unfounded claim that the Obama administration had his “wires tapped.”
The author goes on to state:
Trump is quoted in Politico saying that the probe of Rice’s intent means his notorious wiretapping tweet “is turning out to be true,”""
This is a non-sequitur. His claim that this is more evidence for his earlier claim is NOT whataboutism.
The author also states:
The same tactic is clear in his repeated attempts to stir suspicion around Hillary Clinton, as if her moral missteps might absolve him of the possibility of wrongdoing. There is no specific example here, just a general claim.
and
Trump’s tactic of shifting focus to left-wing figures like Rice and Clinton can be best understood through a Soviet Union propaganda technique known as “whataboutism.” In short, it’s Trump saying, “Oh yeah? My administration is riddled with conflicts of interests, potential collusion with Russia, and my belligerent refusal to release my tax returns? What about [bad thing a Democrat did]?”
This is a straw man argument. Nothing specific, simply claims made by the author and not something Trump himself said.

<user_id=Binksternet>
It looks like you intended to belittle the source, but instead you have shown the cited source to be relevant and applicable. I have restored the text and cite.

<user_id=DeadEyeSmile>
You have provided no explanation how the unsourced claims in the linked article are ""relevant and applicable"". Please point to any part of the article that shows an example of whataboutism.

<user_id=DeadEyeSmile>
I made no attempt to belittle the source. I have simply attempted to show that the source does not prove the claim that it makes and is therefore not a good source.

<user_id=Binksternet>
I don't have to ""point to any part of the article that shows an example of whataboutism"" because the author does so explicitly. She's not hiding the examples or making the reader ferret them out. The source starts with the title ""Trump’s Treatment of the Susan Rice Story Is Classic 'Whataboutism'"" making it relevant and on topic. The story by Lauren Duca continues by describing how Trump uses the techniques of whataboutism to evade scrutiny, shift focus and deflect blame. I don't know what you're looking at, but I'm seeing a professional journalist writing an accurate and relevant article about the topic, published in a respected source. Your argument is empty; you don't have a leg to stand on.

<user_id=Binksternet>
It's a professional work by a veteran journalist, not an opinion piece.

<user_id=Binksternet>
I'm curious: Do you think that Trump, when under fire, does not frequently shift the topic to Obama or Clinton? Because he's famous for that. If you don't think he does that then we're done here.

<user_id=DeadEyeSmile>
The source article is an opinion piece. I quote from the article:
Thigh-High Politics is an op-ed column by Teen Vogue writer Lauren Duca

You have revealed that you are biased against Trump and therefore have a vested interest that this article not be changed. You cannot argue honestly due to your biases so I ask you to recuse yourself.

<user_id=DeadEyeSmile>
This is a statement of fact made in the article: ""When asked to defend his behavior or accused of wrongdoing, Trump has frequently shifted the topic to Democratic figures, such as Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and even U.S. Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice.""

<user_id=DeadEyeSmile>
The source article is an opinion piece so please explain how someone's opinion can be used as a source for a statement of fact.

<user_id=Binksternet>
So this is the issue you want to spend your energy fighting on? The question of whether Trump evades questions of his guilt or complicity by shifting the focus in the manner of whataboutism? You know he does this, of course. It's common knowledge. Even people who support him will admit that he has been known to change the subject to Clinton or Obama when he's given a question he doesn't want to answer. I find it pretty strange that anybody would choose to fight against this obvious truth.

<user_id=159.246.20.2>
The question shouldn't about whether Trump engages in Whataboutism. It should be about why there is blatant bias here. Wikipedia's standards are being maligned by this. The section title should be ""Examples of Whataboutism in American Politics"" and should include various examples, including ones by Trump. If this section is allowed, why not have 300 additional sections titled ""Hillary Clinton and Whataboutism"" or ""Barack Obama and Whataboutism"". Its obviously partisan, and whoever keeps editing the article has indeed shown their bias.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=Jack Upland>
This article is blatantly biased from conception. It suggests that the USSR and Russia are unique in committing the tu quoque fallacy, whereas the fallacy is common and has been recognised for centuries, and it suggests the term ""Whataboutism"" relates to the Cold War, even though there is no documentation that it was used in that period. Then this about Trump. Obviously the alleged Trump-Russia connection prompted this, because otherwise the critique of Trump could be located (if at all) at the tu quoque article. Now, it's suggesting that Trump is the only politician that does this, whereas, obviously, this is routine. So overlaid on the anti-Communist bias, the anti-Russian bias, we have this anti-Trump bias in a witches' brew of unexamined prejudice. Wikipedia completely jumped the shark when Trump was elected and has started creating an article for every blooper, such as Bowling Green massacre and covfefe. Now this article has stopped being a Russian-bashing exercise, and now Trump is the pinata. There is no reason for this article to exist apart for a few editors to vent their frustrations at the rest of the world.

<user_id=DeadEyeSmile>
You continue to try to deflect from my point. I couldn't care less what Trump's behavior is. This is not a political debate, despite the way that you keep trying to make it about politics. The sentence I quoted above  is an attempt to support a statement of fact with an opinion piece, pure and simple. It weakens the article and violates a fundamental principle of Wikipedia.

<user_id=Binksternet>
'Tu quoque'' and whataboutism are not the same thing. ''Tu quoque'' aims to undermine the opponent's argument by pointing out that the opponent's past actions are inconsistent with his current argument. Whataboutism differs by introducing a red herring argument involving irrelevant, widely tangential or patently false claims, and possibly by introducing a balance fallacy equating the irrelevant/tangential/false argument with the opponent's argument. Whataboutism aims to derail the argument entirely, whereas tu quoque assumes that the debate will continue.

<user_id=Binksternet>
You quoted the policy page WP:NPOV which encourages us to represent ""fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic."" The connection between Trump and Whataboutism has been published by reliable sources, so we include a paragraph or two about it. Editor bias is a separate question from whether we include this stuff or not. We include it because it's been publshed. The ""bias"" part is a matter of how we summarize it and how much weight we give to it. Your aim to get rid of the Trump stuff altogether, so that in itself is a contrary to the policy you quoted above.

<user_id=DeadEyeSmile>
Again you misrepresent my point in an attempt to win the argument when you have already shown that you are biased against Trump and therefore are not able to participate in this discussion neutrally. Your statement that '(I) ""aim to get rid of the Trump stuff altogether""' is a lie. Since you continue to misrepresent what I have said, I will repeat my point here:

<user_id=DeadEyeSmile>
This is my argument:
The article makes this statement of fact: ""When asked to defend his behavior or accused of wrongdoing, Trump has frequently shifted the topic to Democratic figures, such as Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and even U.S. Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice."" It then links to the Teen Vogue article, an opinion piece, as a source for this statement. A statement of fact must be supported by facts, not opinions.

<user_id=DeadEyeSmile>
You have attempted to debate that my claim is incorrect and you have attempted to redirect the discussion to other things but your arguments have failed:

<user_id=DeadEyeSmile>
First you tried to claim that the article is ""professional work by a veteran journalist, not an opinion piece.""I have proven that to be wrong using the article itself.
Second you claim that I am wrong because of your political opinion. ""Do you think that Trump, when under fire, does not frequently shift the topic to Obama or Clinton? Because he's famous for that. If you don't think he does that then we're done here."" I have pointed out that this has nothing to do with politics, and that you are demonstrating bias against the subject. This is an attempt to redirect away from my point.
Third you put forth a straw man version of my argument, saying that I ""aim to get rid of the Trump stuff altogether"". I have not challenged any of the statements in the article about Trump which are supported by their sources, so your claim is false.
You have had three tries to refute my argument and all have failed. I have shown that the sentence quoted above is a statement of fact, which is not supported by the opinion stated in the source. I ask you once more to address my argument above without attempting to dismiss it, deflect from it, misrepresent it, or insert your opinions about the subject.

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
DeadEyeSmile - look, it's not your job to start an argument with the source. Please see original research. The source is either reliable or not. If you want to discuss it's reliability ask at WP:RSN. In the meantime, quit it with the edit warring.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. <user_id=DeadEyeSmile> argues that the Teen Vogue article is not a good source because it is an opinion piece and does not provide specific examples of whataboutism as claimed. They assert that the article does not support its claims with evidence and therefore should not be used as a source for a statement of fact on Wikipedia.

2. <user_id=Binksternet> counters by stating that the author of the Teen Vogue article explicitly provides examples of whataboutism and that the article is relevant and on-topic. They argue that the professional status of the journalist and the publication's reputation lend credibility to the source.

3. <user_id=DeadEyeSmile> responds by pointing out that the article is self-described as an op-ed, which is typically an opinion piece, and cites Wikipedia's policy on Neutral Point of View to argue that the source should not be used to support a statement of fact.

4. <user_id=Binksternet> shifts the argument to discuss the nature of whataboutism and tu quoque, and asserts that the connection between Trump and whataboutism has been published by reliable sources, which justifies its inclusion in the Wikipedia article.

5. <user_id=DeadEyeSmile> accuses <user_id=Binksternet> of bias and misrepresentation, reiterating that their concern is with the use of an opinion piece as a source for a statement of fact, not with the political content itself.

6. <user_id=Volunteer Marek> intervenes to suggest that the reliability of the source should be discussed at Wikipedia's Reliable Sources Noticeboard and advises against original research and edit warring.

Evaluation:
- <user_id=DeadEyeSmile> presents a consistent argument focused on Wikipedia's guidelines for source reliability and neutrality.
- <user_id=Binksternet> defends the source's relevance but does not directly address the concern about using an opinion piece to support a statement of fact.
- The discussion includes some elements of personal bias and misrepresentation, which detract from the overall quality.
- The intervention by <user_id=Volunteer Marek> is a constructive attempt to redirect the discussion to an appropriate forum for resolving disputes about source reliability.

Overall, the discussion shows an engagement with Wikipedia's policies and an attempt to apply them to a specific case. However, the quality of the discussion is affected by the participants' focus on political bias and the failure to reach a consensus on the use of opinion pieces as sources for factual statements.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Runtime columns

<user_id=Supermann>
Hello. I would like to call on the following 2017 active members:, , , , ,  and  of the WP:WikiProject Film/Chinese cinema task force to generally comment on whether the runtime columns should be kept. What they look like could only be found by going into the page history since , ,  and  are all for their removal. Exhausting discussions have been conducted among us and they still could not convince me.

<user_id=Supermann>
Again, one column for theatrical runs in major film markets and another for runtime approved by SAPPRFT, sourced to either Douban.com or Maoyan.com in Chinese for consistency, because non-Chinese readers could still command/ctrl+f to look up the runtime for verification. WP:Verifiability#Non-English sources says citations to non-English reliable sources are allowed on the English Wikipedia. Based on the latest June 30, 2017 guidelines from the China Netcasting Services Association, an organization subject to SAPPRFT, we could now see more clearly what content is on the radar of SAPPRFT. I do think the runtime columns are helpful from a mathematical/quantifiable standpoint to understand how much of a film is censored. With reasoning now given for most of the censored films, I do believe it's time to add back the runtime columns. I have already compromised on the arguments that runtime alone doesn't suffice and release year don't have to include exact dates for better tracking, but I reject the arguments that having these two columns are WP:OR, or still INDISCRIMINATE that do not have any encyclopedic values. No single website on the Internet has come up with such an exhaustive list. Let's make it great again by adhering to the last of the Wikipedia:Five pillars! And the truth on the censorship of The Mummy will eventually come out when the bluray is released.

<user_id=CWH>
Thanks for pinging me. I strongly support restoring the run-time columns. I teach China film courses and do research on Chinese films. Run-times can almost always be sourced reliably enough, and are useful for recent films in telling which version you are getting.
What raises questions and is NOT possible to reliably source is the reason for ""editing."" Somtimes it's censorship, sometimes even a film shown in a theater is a version shortened to show on TV, sometimes because the theaters want to sell more popcorn, or studio executives think they know better than the director, or because... well, who knows? All we should do, and we ''should'' do it, is give readers the running times in each country and let readers draw any conclusions. That is, no need for a column doing the subtracting (or addition, in some cases).
As I mentioned above, the ""reasoning"" is often unclear, disputed, or alleged, so I favor the ""Notes"" column.

<user_id=TenTonParasol>
I think the issue is that runtime doesn't necessarily mean that the film is ''censored''. Like, if the film is edited for reasons ''other'' than censorship—as CWH points out for marketing, or shortened for TV, etc—and like, those shouldn't be included on this article. ""Let readers draw any conclusions"" is basically akin to WP:OR. The article shouldn't ''do'' that. ~Cheers,

<user_id=Supermann>
Because runtime is always approved by SAPPRFT, the state censor has the final say, regardless of what producers intend to do. Those Chinese websites supporting the Chinese runtime do also explicitly list the runtime in other major film markets as a free service to let readers know what is going on, so we are not ""implying a conclusion not clearly stated by the sources themselves."" So it's not OR nor SYNTH. If you don't believe me, go to a Chinese runtime in the page history, and ctrl/command+f on the source site to look for the prevailing western runtime.

<user_id=CWH>
Sorry, , for adding ""reasons other than censorship,"" which were a distraction. You are right that these should not be part of this article. My basic point is still that runtime is useful, and the films on the list must be referenced as censorship.

<user_id=TenTonParasol>
I think that change in runtime is useful to note when content is added or the runtime is significantly reduced. And such can be noted in the notes column. I'm just wary of using runtime alone to put forward the idea that a film has been censored. And, like, I know there's been prior dispute about what exactly the criteria of inclusion is, and whether or not a producer voluntarily editing a film down for marketing reasons falls within inclusion. My understand from recent consensus is that it doesn't. ~Cheers,

<user_id=Supermann>
Only fewer than 1/4 on the list doesn't currently have a reasoning note thanks to lousy writers from the China Film Insiders, but still it's a source of some sort. The consensus as I understood it is no consensus, but I just don't want to engage in further editing wars.

<user_id=TenTonParasol>
There's four people who are in support of removing runtimes, one person unopposed but with no strong feelings. The consensus has been in favor of removing runtimes. There's at least three persons stating that inclusion criteria excludes those altered voluntarily without demand from the government. ~Cheers,

<user_id=Supermann>
Now that I pointed out the Chinese runtime sources from Douban/Maoyan also do list western runtime, I think whoever supports removing them should rethink if it is still OR. The sources distinguish the runtime for a reason. Censorship. Period. The evidence is now mounting.

<user_id=TenTonParasol>
Until the source explicitly says ""It was cut five minutes due to censorship"" it's OR because you're determining an implicit intention that isn't stated on the source itself. The sourcing on runtimes isn't the issue the issue is ""a different runtime automatically means that the film was censored, i.e the SAPPRFT demanded the film be edited"". A source listing two runtimes is not that. ~Cheers,

<user_id=Supermann>
There is still naivete on your part regarding censorship. It's like you just don't get it. Time to IAR.

<user_id=Erik>
TenTonParasol is correct that the consensus is against including runtime columns, and there is no new argument to include it. The root problem of including them stays the same. She is also correct in saying that a source needs to clearly state that a film has been censored.   |  (ping me)

<user_id=TenTonParasol>
And you're still not understanding how things work. IAR isn't leave to do whatever you want. Not even the no firm rules pillar allows one to do whatever they want. There needs to be some sort of defined scope for the article, we can't just list every single film that's ever been edited for release in China for every single reason. That's indiscriminate, see WP:INDISCRIMINATE. Every film listed on it needs a strong rationale for inclusion. IAR doesn't give you leave to go against consensus. This has been stated by a handful of editors other than myself, and you're just being dismissive and condescending. I understand what your point is regarding censorship in China, but the article needs a defined definition of it. Is that definition going to be ""this film was edited in any way by anyone, voluntarily or not, for any reason""? Is that definition going to be ""this film was changed under direction or pressure by a government body"" (which is generally the more traditional definition of censorship)? If anything, I'd say for a film to be included, you'd literally need a source that literally has the word ""censored"" in it. Otherwise, we're speculating on reasons. And we cannot do that. It has been stated by other editors (including myself, to be transparent) that you're attempting to soapbox and advocacy edit and generally be tendentious on this topic to push a particular point of view, so your constant misconstruing of IAR to dismiss consensus and condescension just feels a part of that. ~Cheers,

<user_id=Kmhkmh>
I agree with TenTonParasol here. There needs to be a proper definition of censorship and/or it is be assumed the common use of the word applies (""this film was changed under direction or pressure by a government body""). Any film added here needs to have a source stating censorship explicitly.

<user_id=Hoverfish>
Indeed the source has to literally mention the film was ""censored"" and IF it mentions the duration of the ""censored"" part, then this timing can be mentioned. We are not going to decide here that a film was censored because of any indication that we are convinced must have been censorship. This is one issue. The other is that when there is a clear consensus against including runtimes and one editor keeps bringing back the issue and insisting we don't get it and he does, it tends to be disruptive.

<user_id=Supermann>
I am not doing soapboxing, but I want all the editors,  in particular, to know that today is the day that Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo died.

<user_id=TenTonParasol>
And how is that relevant to this article or this discussion? This is not a forum. ~Cheers,

<user_id=Supermann>
People die from censorship in China. Cheers as you put it.

<user_id=TenTonParasol>
Still not actually relevant to this page nor the runtime columns. And let's leave my signature, which is as it is literally every single time I sign a page and has no bearing about my attitude toward any discussion at hand, out of it. ~Cheers,

<user_id=Supermann>
All what I have been trying to say is we need to use more primary sources here, because secondary sources may not write about these stuff all the time due to manpower/budgetary constraints, etc. For example, today I have 200% confirmation from Universal Pictures that The Mummy (2017 film) is 110 minutes, not 107 minutes. This means the Chinese release of 106 minutes is definitely censored. Yet China Film Insider has been still unwilling to write about it, thinking the time difference is only due to the trailer of American Made attached to the end credits of The Mummy. When I invoked IAR, I meant not carte blanche. I mean let's not make Wikipedia too tertiary source! How many Liu Xiaobo have to die before you realize the censorship problem in China. Look at how Dr. Liu is censored post death at https://www.ft.com/content/b6d56066-6847-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614 I beg you. No more stubbornness in not using the runtime columns.

<user_id=TenTonParasol>
The usage of primary sources, rather the avoiding of making interpretations of primary sources, isn't something that's limited to this article. The policy on primary sources, WP:PRIMARY, states:  Stating that ""shorter runtime = censorship"" is an interpretation of the primary source. Wikipedia, by definition, ''is'' a tertiary source. We're not saying there ISN'T a censorship problem in China, we're just saying that the way we write about it must be done in a certain way. ~Cheers,

<user_id=Supermann>
We are not writing the whole page on primary sources. We are just using the runtime column to make descriptive statements of facts that the runtime is shortened. Given the fact that PRC does have a censor, this is where I am invoking IAR, no more so-called MUST. We could make further qualitative interpretation if secondary sources are willing to do it, but the runtime column is a quantitative description of censorship.

<user_id=TenTonParasol>
It's been explained before, over and over. It is an interpretative statement to say ""shorter runtime = state censorship"". That has not changed. It is genuinely unfortunate that it is difficult for secondary sources to write about the topic, but we are restricted. We cannot make the interpretation ourselves. A shorter runtime is quantitative of nothing other than a shorter runtime. As has been discussed all over the page, runtime differences can occur for reasons ''other'' than state censorship. State censorship sometimes doesn't alter the runtime at all. None of this has changed. ~Cheers,

<user_id=Supermann>
Then you kept forgetting the June 2017 notice from SAPPRFT which requires non-release of other versions. For The Mummy, 106 min is the only version allowed to be seen in China. Not the 110 min. If that's not censorship as well, then what is?

<user_id=TenTonParasol>
Frankly, whether or not films altered for reasons other than state censorship being affected by the June notice should be discussed as under the scope of this article. But that's not the topic at hand here. As stated before, we cannot speculate on ''why'' something is. We need a reliable secondary source, or a statement from the filmmakers themselves, saying that it is state censorship. You are stubbornly refusing to understand what the policies on sourcing and original research is. Personally, I agree with you that ''The Mummy'' is probably censored. Does my opinion matter a damn whit? No. If there is no secondary source containing the word ""censored"" in it, we cannot say that it was censored. ~Cheers,

<user_id=Supermann>
Personally, I agree with you that ''The Mummy'' is probably censored. So hard to elicit this out of you, but I do think your personal opinion matters. And this is where IAR should work. And you are still not getting it.

<user_id=TenTonParasol>
No, it actually doesn't. My opinion that a film is censored is not at all grounds for inclusion on the article or what is said about the article. The only thing that matters is what is stated by reliable secondary sources or, in this case, the filmmakers themselves. I can go on all day about how this film or that film is censorship, but it means absolutely ''shit all'' until a secondary reliable source backs the statement. You are misunderstanding how to construct articles, the general purpose of Wikipedia, how the verifiability policy (WP:VERIFY) works. You're insistence on shaping the article to be something that goes out to shed light on an issue is the definition of soapboxing (WP:SOAPBOX) and violates the neutral point of view policy (WP:NPOV). You cannot IAR the verifiability policy, you cannot IAR the NPOV policy. Our opinions and individual, original ''interpretative'' assessments of primary sources have no place in the article. It is tedious and frankly frustrating that no matter how many times this is explained to you, ''you'' don't seem to get it. If you cannot understand it is absolutely out of line to write an article specifically to support one's point of views, to ignore basic and foundational policy because it doesn't allow an article to be written to support your point of view, or you continue to refuse to understand the basic sourcing and writing policies, then writing Wikipedia articles is probably not the place for you. ~Cheers,

<user_id=Supermann>
I still believe your stubbornness is in violation of the IAR spirit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Understanding_IAR This page in a nutshell: If a rule prevents you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia, ignore it. Pls tell me how you have performed IAR at all in this article.

<user_id=TenTonParasol>
Tell me how ignoring the NPOV and verification policies at all helps the article? Ignore all rules does not: ""does not prevent the enforcement of certain policies"", ""mean that every action is justifiable"", ""does not mean there is necessarily an exception to every rule"". ~Cheers,

<user_id=Supermann>
You are quoting another essay against my essay. There are five essays on IAR. How come a little bit of exception on the Runtime columns and The Mummy violate the improvement to Wikipedia at all? We have given a full accounting of the Communist argument here in terms of why they think the censorship is necessary. Isn't that NPOV enough?

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Argument for Inclusion of Runtime Columns**: User Supermann argues that the runtime columns are a quantitative measure of censorship, as the state censor (SAPPRFT) has the final say on the runtime of films in China. They suggest that the difference in runtime between the Chinese version and the international version is indicative of censorship. They also argue that primary sources should be used more frequently, especially when secondary sources may not cover certain topics due to various constraints.

2. **Argument against Inclusion of Runtime Columns**: Users TenTonParasol, CWH, Kmhkmh, Hoverfish, and Erik argue that the inclusion of runtime columns based on the assumption that a shorter runtime equals censorship is a form of original research (OR) and synthesis, which is against Wikipedia's policies. They emphasize the need for secondary sources that explicitly state that a film has been censored. They also point out that runtime differences can occur for various reasons other than state censorship, and that Wikipedia is a tertiary source that should not make interpretative statements based on primary sources.

3. **Understanding of Wikipedia Policies**: User TenTonParasol demonstrates a strong understanding of Wikipedia's policies on verifiability, neutral point of view, and no original research. They consistently argue that without explicit statements from reliable secondary sources, the assumption of censorship cannot be made.

4. **Relevance of Arguments**: The arguments against the inclusion of runtime columns are more relevant to Wikipedia's guidelines and policies. They focus on the need for verifiable and neutral content, which is the foundation of Wikipedia's content guidelines.

5. **Coherence and Civility**: The discussion is mostly coherent, with each user presenting their points in a logical manner. However, there are instances where User Supermann's arguments become less focused on the topic at hand and more on the broader issue of censorship in China, which, while important, is not directly relevant to the specific discussion about runtime columns. Additionally, User Supermann's reference to Liu Xiaobo's death, while emotionally charged, does not contribute to the argument about the inclusion of runtime columns.

6. **Use of Rhetorical Strategies**: User Supermann attempts to use emotional appeals and the invocation of IAR (Ignore All Rules) to support their position. However, these strategies are not effectively used as they do not align with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Overall, the arguments against the inclusion of runtime columns are more aligned with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, are more relevant to the specific discussion, and are presented in a coherent and civil manner. The arguments for inclusion rely more on emotional appeals and a misunderstanding or misapplication of Wikipedia's IAR policy.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5

The score reflects the strong understanding and application of Wikipedia policies by most users involved in the discussion, but it is brought down by the less relevant and policy-aligned arguments presented by User Supermann.",6.5

Hello. I am not a single purpose account. I am an IP user which are just as legit as any one with a registered user on wikipedia. IP users make up the major contributors of wikipedia and as IPs change their contributions get lost into previous IPs, so just because I edited this article does not mean that your personal experiences should take precedence over mine.

Back to topic, I said I would be bringing in more references as I am not in favour of trimming valid facts from wikipedia though I support writing the articles in neutral way and not advertising any specific party. I gave some references before and there are more references I found from the library and I am sending scanned copies of the same for your review. That settles my support of including the claim that he was in fact the founder (or pioneer) of British e-commerce. The article from Marketing in 1988 states 'MAID has built a unique technology platform that allows articles to be purchased using computers. Mr Wagner has pioneered the technology to take payment in this way....' (obviously in 1988 ecommerce wasn't even a term that had been invented but the quote is clear) and the second article is from the UK national newspaper the Guardian dated May 1995 which says ''...(he) sees where the information highway is headed before anyone else has dreamed up the phrase' and '...ten years later, widely regarded as having invented electronic commerce, he launches his pioneering company.....'. I have done enough for my burden of proof as far as WP:V goes by giving reliable sources. Now if any one wants to read more on the topic, it is up to them to go to a library - but from my end, for some verification of the facts, I am giving the historical references for your reading as a courtesy and not just their citation details. You can see the scanned copies on the following links: Marketing Mag - May 1988 https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8CxFjCGp3NEWlE2eGphSEtaajA and The Guardian Newspaper - May 1995 https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8CxFjCGp3NEWlU0ZVlfTGMwd0U

You are synthesizing your own opinion from the ecommerce wikipedia article and other references. None of them state or argue that Dan Wagner was not the founder of British ecommerce. They might mention other similar services but saying that Dan (Marketing Mag - May 1988 https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8CxFjCGp3NEWlE2eGphSEtaajA and The Guardian Newspaper - May 1995 https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8CxFjCGp3NEWlU0ZVlfTGMwd0U) called (or credited) Dan Wagner the founder of British ecommerce will be an indisputable statement. Because I did provide references that did call him that. Now, this can be said in a more neutral way as I stated. Such technologies evolve and may be pioneered in multiple ways. That does not negate my argument in any way.

<user_id=Yak shaving>
Nothing you provided states 'founder of British ecommerce'. I've presented you and other editors with information showing that the subject was not the first to do 'ecommerce' in Britain. Also according to this https://www.brightstation.com/maid, the product wasn't launched until 1985, the business was formed in 1984. Given all of this the current intro 'He created MAID, '''one of the first''' internet online information platforms in 1984' is fair although the date is debatable.
I've revert another WP:NONCON change by IP 95.210.221.6. Please discuss suggested changes on this page for all editors to review and agree.

<user_id=Melcous>
I've been asked to comment again - for now I'll just say that I do not think it has been demonstrated that ""the founder of British ecommerce"" is a verifiable and valid claim and do not support it being re-inserted in the article.

<user_id=95.210.221.6>
Yak, your comments are original research. Wikipedia rules require us to say what reliable resources state. We are not allowed to do our own research on who is infact the founder or who started such a business first. That would be WP:TRUTH of your understanding and should not be a part of the discussion here. If a reliable resource mentions or implies or calls Dan Wagner the founder, then we should write it as such. If editors have problem it being neutral, it can be modified to attribution like ""[source here] called [or credited] Dan Wagner as the founder of British E-Commerce."" Your calculations and dates have no value here just like mine. Neither can you combine and research different sources. We will article what a references ''says'' properly.

<user_id=95.210.221.6>
Melcous, If you disagree, I can collect all resources and start an RFC to get a better consensus. I can do that in the next days unless you people are willing to discuss the attributed suggestion I gave.

<user_id=Yak shaving>
Ok, setting aside the contributions you claim to be WP:OR, the fact remains that the articles you've presented have not stated that the subject is 'the founder of the British e-commerce' (the actual quote). Implication is not adequate for WP:BLP. WP:BLPREMOVE clearly states '''Remove immediately any contentious material about a living person that...is a conjectural interpretation of a source (see No original research)'''. Your supposition is, and to quote WP:OR, a 'synthesis of published material that serves to reach or '''imply''' a conclusion not stated by the sources'. By all means, provide more evidence so I and other editors can reconsider the proposal. Also, you may wish to consider WP:BLPSELF and make a post to WP:BLPN and request that other 'uninvolved editors evaluate the article to make sure it is fairly written and properly sourced.'

<user_id=Ol king col>
About a page up I was asked for my opinion, for what it's worth here it is.  has presented a couple of solid sources that do associate one of  the subjects previous companies with e-commerce in its earliest days (side note / question -  has stated they're in France, so  I am curious which library in France had copies of English newspapers from over 20 years ago, and English Marketing magazines from 30 years ago? Just curious for my future reference). However  and wikipedias own pages E-commerce clearly show that e-commerce was happening before the subjects business began. As such and in accordance with what https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability,_not_truth#.22If_it.27s_written_in_a_book.2C_it_must_be_true.21.22 I  believe that the following is extremely relevant to this claim '''In some cases, publication in a reliable source is not sufficient to establish that a view is significant. Reliable sources may be outdated or disputed by other sources.''' with the two provided sources being 20 and 30 years old they are hardly the most up to date, and therefore it has not been demonstrated that the claim that the subject is ""the founder of British ecommerce"" is verifiable and / or a valid claim and so I do not support it being re-inserted in the article.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The initial argument by the IP user (85.255.233.221) is about the legitimacy of IP users on Wikipedia and their contributions. The user defends their position by stating that they have provided a reference for their edit, which is a valid point in Wikipedia's editing policy that emphasizes verifiability and sourcing.

2. Scope creep responds by clarifying that their previous comment was not directed at the IP user but at a single-purpose account (SPA) that was warned by an admin. This shows an understanding of the difference between constructive IP contributions and potential disruptive editing by SPAs.

3. The IP user (82.163.113.33) raises concerns about potential sock puppetry, which is a valid concern on Wikipedia, especially in the context of contentious edits. However, the accused IP user (95.210.221.6) defends themselves by explaining the nature of dynamic IP addresses and requests to focus on the topic.

4. The IP user (95.210.221.6) provides references to support their claim that Dan Wagner was a pioneer of British e-commerce. This is a strong argument as it adheres to Wikipedia's requirement for reliable sources.

5. Another IP user (82.163.113.33) counters by providing evidence of earlier e-commerce activities in the UK, which challenges the claim that Dan Wagner was the founder of British e-commerce. This is also a strong argument as it provides additional context and sources.

6. Yak shaving enters the discussion with a newly registered account, previously having contributed as an IP user. They provide a link to a cache of newspaper clippings, which could be useful for verifying information.

7. The IP user (95.210.221.6) argues that the provided references do call Dan Wagner a founder of British e-commerce, but Yak shaving points out that implication is not sufficient for a biography of a living person on Wikipedia, which requires clear and direct statements from sources.

8. Melcous, another user, agrees that the claim has not been demonstrated to be verifiable or valid, which aligns with Wikipedia's policies on biographies of living persons and verifiability.

9. Ol king col provides a balanced view, acknowledging the sources provided by the IP user but also recognizing that other sources and Wikipedia's own articles contradict the claim, which is an important consideration in Wikipedia's policy on verifiability and the weight of sources.

Overall, the discussion shows a good understanding of Wikipedia's policies on verifiability, sourcing, and the importance of consensus. The participants engage in a back-and-forth dialogue, presenting evidence and counter-evidence, and addressing concerns about potential policy violations such as original research and sock puppetry. The discussion remains focused on the content and the application of Wikipedia's guidelines, which is indicative of a high-quality debate.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.",8.0

Previous political affiliations)

<user_id=Laurel Lodged>
Who says that her membership of the Socialist Party is a ""previous political affiliation""? Is there anything to say that is is not a continuing membership? Membership of one organisation does not preclude membership of others. IMHO, it can be reasonably asserted that she is currently a member of the Socialist Party, Solidarity (previously AAA) and Solidarity-PBP. It is, after all, a well -known tactic of Troyskyists to decant themselves into organisations with less frightening names in order to subvert them to the true aims of Trotskyism. Ms Coppinger seems to be a good practitioner of the art. It would require a high degree of naivety to say otherwise.

<user_id=This is Paul>
I think this is probably the most neutral way of wording the article, which after all is a biography of a living person. We would need a very reliable source to verify her membership of the party before we could add it here. Most of the sources I've found have referred to her as a socialist rather than as a member of the Socialist Party – there is a difference. But if you believe she is still a member of the Socialist Party and want her article to say as much, then you need to find evidence of that.

<user_id=Spleodrach>
I agree with Laurel Lodged. Coppinger is a member of the Socialist Party, she has also joined the AAA, now Solidarity, and also Solidarity-PBP. As Laurel Lodged said, she can be a member of more than one organisation. There is no evidence that she left the Socialist Party. If she did leave it, it's up to you to provide a reliable reference stating this fact. Looking at her twitter profile: ""Solidarity TD for Dublin West, Socialist Party member, Member of Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government & Committee on the 8th Amendment"". Not a third party ref, I know but from the horses mouth....!

<user_id=This is Paul>
Unfortunately her twitter post can't be used as a reliable source, and the statement on there is ambiguous anyway. There is no doubt she was a member of the Socialist Party, but is she stating that she still is a member of that party, or is she merely acknowledging that she was in the past. The nature of political parties tends to be that there's an assumption with ""membership"" that, unless specified by inter-party agreement, a person cannot be a member of two parties that operate in the same area. If you believe that's different in Ruth Coppinger's case, then I'm afraid the onus is on either yourself or Laurel Lodged to prove she is still a member of the Socialist Party, at least if you wish to add that information anyway. It's not for me to prove why it shouldn't be included, and if you don't supply reliable sources to back up the statement then the information will just be removed again, either by me or someone else. Sorry if you don't like that, but this is an encyclopedia, and any statements added here need to be supported with reliable sources.

<user_id=Spleodrach>
No, the onus is on you. You are asserting that she has left the Socialist Party, therefore it is up to you to prove this is so. Please provide a reliable reference for your assertions. For example, Clare Daly was previously a member of the Socialist Party but left in 2012. There are plenty of reliable references for this. If, as you also claim, that Coppinger has left the SP, then it shouldn't be too hard to find references for this assertion.

<user_id=This is Paul>
Let's see if I can explain this clearly. People don't usually belong to more than one political party. Joining a new party usually means that the person concerned will have left their previous party (see Crossing the floor and Party switching for example). There are some exceptions to that status quo, and if that is the case here and you wish to say as much then you need to provide evidence. That means finding sources, which you can post here. That doesn't mean making sweeping statements like ""There are plenty of reliable references for this"". That being the case then it shouldn't be too difficult for you to find them then, should it? And it is your responsibility to do that. It's not mine. I'm not the one who wants to add the information. If you're unhappy with my thoughts on this you're welcome to seek a third opinion, or take it to WP:DRN. In fact, I highly recommend you do that, because if you continue with this silly argument, then I will seek the opinion of others.

<user_id=Laurel Lodged>
Paul, it would be worth your while having a wee read of Entryism. The pertinent bit is ""is a political strategy in which an organisation or state encourages its members or supporters to join another, usually larger, organisation in an attempt to expand influence and expand their ideas and program. In situations where the organization being ""entered"" is hostile to entrism, the entrists may engage in a degree of subterfuge and subversion to hide the fact that they are an organisation in their own right."". As  and I have been patiently trying to explain to you, this is what extreme socialists engage in. As you might expect, they of course deny that they engage in it. Ms Coppinger is an entrist. You will find no confession from her stating that this is her cunning strategy. As people close to the political situation here in Ireland, you can take it that Spleodrach & I know what we're talking about. So that puts the onus back on you to find a source saying that she has resigned from her multiple party organisations. Trust us - you won't find any.

<user_id=This is Paul>
Aah, nothing like the old I'm an expert argument when all else fails. Oh, and thanks for the quick lesson in Irish politics (now deleted I see). Now to the matter in hand. If you really won't find any sources discussing Ruth Coppinger's apparent subterfuge, then you can't add any allegations of it here. It's a violation of WP:BLP (which you might both want to read incidentally), and as someone with over 100,000 edits, I would have expected better from , but there you have it. BTW, I am of Irish descent, and have relatives living in Ireland, so I do know a little bit about Irish politics. Obviously I'm not an expert like yourselves. So that leaves me with a bit of a dilemma really, whether to; a) bow to your much greater knowledge, or b) adhere to Wikipedia policy. Alas I fear a WP:DRN request is not far away.

<user_id=Laurel Lodged>
This is a talk page, not the article itself. Where have we violated WP:BLP? Where in the article have we put forward the opinion that Ms Coppinger is an entrist with a cunning strategy? We have asserted that she was, and remains, a member of multiple parties. You have not find any sources to contradict this.

<user_id=Spleodrach>
Well, I live in Dublin, and I do know people who are members of these organisations, but I don't claim that makes me an expert. User:This is Paul is the one claiming that Coppinger left the Socialist Party when she joined AAA or Solidarity. Joining another 'front' organisation, does not necessarily preclude one from staying a member of the original organisation. There is no evidence exists that Coppinger left the SP, so User:This is Paul is engaged in Original Research, and would do well to read WP:OR. If she did leave the SP, please provide a reliable reference for it, otherwise it's OR on your part. Also, I have no objection at all to WP:DRN.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The core of the argument revolves around whether Ruth Coppinger is still a member of the Socialist Party while also being a member of other political organizations. User Laurel Lodged and User Spleodrach assert that she is, based on the practice of entryism and her own Twitter profile. They argue that unless there is evidence to the contrary, it should be assumed she is still a member.

2. User This is Paul counters by stating that Wikipedia requires reliable sources for such claims, especially in a biography of a living person. He points out that membership in multiple political parties is generally exclusive, and without clear evidence of concurrent memberships, the default assumption should be that a person does not belong to multiple parties.

3. User Laurel Lodged introduces the concept of entryism to explain why there might not be explicit evidence of Coppinger's multiple memberships, suggesting that it is a common practice among Trotskyists to infiltrate other organizations without openly declaring their affiliations.

4. User This is Paul emphasizes adherence to Wikipedia's policies, particularly WP:BLP (Biographies of Living Persons), which requires verifiable and reliable sources for information about living individuals. He also suggests that the burden of proof lies with those who want to add or maintain the information.

5. User Spleodrach insists that the lack of evidence of Coppinger leaving the Socialist Party should be taken as an indication that she is still a member, while User This is Paul maintains that such an assumption constitutes original research, which is against Wikipedia's guidelines.

6. Both sides suggest taking the dispute to Wikipedia's Dispute Resolution Noticeboard (WP:DRN) for further discussion and resolution.

Evaluation of Argument Quality:

- User Laurel Lodged and User Spleodrach present an argument based on their understanding of political practices in Ireland and a Twitter profile, which is not considered a reliable source according to Wikipedia standards.
- User This is Paul consistently refers to Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, emphasizing the need for reliable sources and cautioning against original research and potential violations of the biography of a living person policy.
- The discussion involves some understanding of political strategy (entryism) but fails to provide the necessary reliable sources to substantiate the claims made about Coppinger's political affiliations.
- The dialogue shows an attempt to resolve the issue through Wikipedia's established dispute resolution processes, which is a positive aspect of the discussion.

Overall, the discussion demonstrates a mix of informed speculation, adherence to Wikipedia policies, and a willingness to seek resolution through appropriate channels. However, the lack of reliable sources to support the claims made by User Laurel Lodged and User Spleodrach weakens their argument. User This is Paul's insistence on following Wikipedia's guidelines strengthens the quality of the discussion by maintaining the integrity of the encyclopedia's content standards.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Mathematics section

<user_id=Jasper Deng>
However obvious these results might be, I do not believe this section falls under WP:CALC, and therefore should not be included. It takes more than a few direct arithmetic calculations to arrive at them, and readers have to be able to verify the results themselves, which is nontrivial here.

<user_id=Unscintillating>
Why shouldn't this fall under WP:CALC?  I didn't even use a calculator.  My recollection from WT:V is that this is not pushing the limits of verifiability under WP:CALC.  I'd support removing the claimed win rate until we have a decent source. 

<user_id=Unscintillating>
I see that I responded here without knowing that you've created your own version of the article.  Your edit comment complains that the win rate, a statement with a ""citation needed"" tag, doesn't fall within WP:CALC.  Of course not, that is a straw man argument. 

<user_id=Lynton1>
@ Jasper Deng: As things stand, you have deleted the entire section. You imply the results are obvious (I agree) but then you imply they are difficult to verify (I disagree). All the results are verifiable and I have supporting screenshots which I will add to the section when it is reinstated. I also have a screenshot to support my original claim that a win rate of 56%+ is achievable over a run of 100 games. A lot of community effort has been invested in this concise and well-written section. It is a beautiful, and rigorous, piece that adds significantly to the understanding of Microsoft Hearts. I disagree with your action to remove it.

<user_id=Lynton1>
@Unscintillating: Thank you for entering into this discussion. Please note: Jasper has deleted the entire Mathematics section. I trust our good reason will prevail in having the section re-instated.

<user_id=Unscintillating>
Please use four tildes (~~~~) at the end of each post you make on a talk page for attribution.  That is how we sign our posts.  Thank you,

<user_id=Unscintillating>
I gave Jaspar a chance to respond, but he has disengaged for the moment.  One point he clearly wanted was to not use the win rate, something I can support.  However, for the record here on the talk page, Linton1 has told me on my talk page that he collected data over 7000 games and that the win rate was 56%.  While not a WP:RS, is still a source of information for editors to consider (see WP:Inaccuracy).If I thought Jaspar would object to a reasonable next edit restoring most of the section, I'd go back to the consensus version of the article first.  But he has disengaged and I kinda prefer the latest revision that mentions two of the shortest games.  So I will try restoring that version, but without the win rate. 

<user_id=Lynton1>
@Unscintillating, @ Jasper Deng:  I have now figured out how to post images. Please refer to my screenshot as verification of an achievable win rate of 56%. I also have other screenshots illustrating other claims made in the section.
thumb|56% verified win rate

<user_id=Jasper Deng>
I strongly oppose the inclusion of any mathematical analysis of the game unless and until reliable sources are found that perform the analysis. There has never been a consensus that game theory falls under WP:CALC, and as I keep emphasizing, nor can the derivation be of the form ""3 times 5 equals 15"". Similarly, we cannot include the win rate because for all we know, that image could have been doctored (just being the devil's advocate, not saying you did), which is why user-uploaded images are not considered reliable sources. Another thing to consider is WP:DUE. If no reliable sources have reported on it, then we should not give it any weight.

<user_id=Unscintillating>
You've got some policy words, but don't seem to know how they apply.  ""3 times 5 equals 15"" requires nothing above high school math.  Going to the library is not original research.  Reading for meaning is not original research.  Yes, I don't support using the screenshot on the Article page, but I've already directed editor's attention to WP:Inaccuracy.  Due weight is a matter of editorial judgment.  I'm not really sure what your issue is. 

<user_id=Jasper Deng>
No, I certainly do know how to apply them. If you read my comment carefully, my point is that the conclusions presented in the section are ''not'' of the form ""3 times 5 equals 15"". ""Reading for meaning"" is not a meaningful phrase, and it's besides the point that due weight is a matter of editorial judgement: my judgement as an editor is that the section is undue weight.

<user_id=Jasper Deng>
Once again, I am not. Please do not make presumptions about what I am or what I am not, this is the second time such a supposition has been incorrect. Things like win rate, longest possible game, shortest possible game, best play, and what not are pretty much game theory. And please refrain from labelling my removal ""molestation"" (as implied by your use of the term ""unmolested""). The facts are ''not'' verifiable by those who do not know sufficient math. It doesn't matter how long it was in the article. Wikipedia policy is what matters. Wikipedia used to be about ""verifiability, not truth"".

<user_id=Jasper Deng>
You have also edited this section, please chime in.

<user_id=Lynton1>
@Jasper I have removed my reference to molestation -). I understood Game Theory to mean ""the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers"" (Wikipedia). As such this discussion may possibly come under Game Theory, but not the original section being discussed - which only introduces probability theory.

<user_id=Lynton1>
@Jasper: You are confused in your analysis. The section has nothing to do with Game theory. So far, the mathematical ideas are very basic (although I would personally love to see more). There is nothing controversial here. There is no slander. The facts are verifiable. The section is a serious attempt to extend knowledge in an otherwise esoteric domain. It adds a lot to the article and detracts nothing.

<user_id=Renamed user 2560613081>
Hello, Jasper. It's been a long time. I feel I am losing touch with the old guard. (Well, except FleetCommand, with whom I might not mind losing touch!)

<user_id=Renamed user 2560613081>
Yes, I reverted the section once: revision 800729830. I usually revert when I see contributions that amount to patent nonsense. I cannot possibly fix these myself and a reversion is usually educational. An editor, be it , myself or anyone else, must always preview – or at least review – his own edit. Lynton1 did not realize that his contribution is broken and is not rendered as he intended. I did.
You see, I (and nobody else) care to what extent WP:CALC is stretched as long as the explanation is clear, conscise and well-worded. (Believe me, you wouldn't.) This contribution was the opposite: I read the first paragraph, understood nothing, and run into ""does provide a beautiful symmetry"", which is subjective, contains peacock terms and forbidden in Wikipedia. On the top of it, I ran into a broken image. (Wikipedia does not display an image from an external source. We take the use of non-free images very seriously.) And when I load it in another tab manually, I don't see symmetry (beautiful or otherwise) but congruity. Traversing the subsequent sentences is like crossing a minefield. I run into:
probability unknown (then how do you know it?)
citation to be provided (in plain text)
 (broken template)
this is a truly beautiful scenario with an incalculable probability? Are there any super quants out there to calculate this?! (what iritates and confuses me the most is the question mark! While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, in the case, the beholder's eye isn't certain and the beholder himself sees fit to write this incertainty multiply incertainty.)
In practice, a good player can achieve a win-rate of 57%+ (player vs computer over 100 games). A win rate of 56% has been verified by an addict with a continuous recorded game history exceeding 7000 games. This sentence has done a superb job of doing exactly what must '''NOT''' be done in Wikipedia, as mandated by WP:5P.
And then,  goes ahead and counter-reverts my reversion, without an edit summary, as if I am a vandal!
has put up a valiant effort to restore the low quality contents but unfortunately, the quality of the result is so poor, that I am sure if Unscintillating had reviewed, he'd have rejected it.
Best regards,

<user_id=Jasper Deng>
Whatever you call it, it's not sufficiently trivial to fall under WP:CALC (and probability theory firmly doesn't, in my opinion).  I think both of us should work on toning down our comments, we shouldn't WP:BITE Lynton1.

<user_id=Renamed user 2560613081>
Hello again. )

<user_id=Renamed user 2560613081>
FleetCommand warned me you might say something like that! Being gracious to newcomer becomes the most difficult when they commit a huge mistake, e.g. spend hours writing a section that runs afoul of Wikipedia's fundamental policies. When you try to tell them euphemistically, they mistake it for an attack, because they think they are (to a very good degree) right. In such cases, treating the situation is best done like ripping a band aid: Do it quick! In other words, be consice, frank, and to the point, but not obnoxious.
When Lython1 reverted me without an edit summary, I neither engaged in edit war, nor complained, nor reported him for rudeness. I wouldn't have written the complaint above if you hadn't asked me to chime in. I would have waited more and then would have broken it to him after a while.
Best regards,

Jaspar Deng has not been able to provide any definition of WP:CALC, so he is currently arguing from personal opinion. 

<user_id=Jasper Deng>
Because I don't need to recite a definition that I'm using and linking to.  Please stop misspelling my username (there is only one ""a"" in it). And I am not arguing from personal opinion: the simple fact is that as this does not fall under ""basic arithmetic"", per WP:V, the burden is on you (as one of those who wants to keep the content), not me, to illustrate that this is a ""routine"" calculation and to obtain consensus that it is an appropriate reflection of sources, which you have not. I shouldn't need to be this precise anyways. This isn't a legal argument.

<user_id=Unscintillating>
So your position is that it is correct because I am wikilawyering?  That is your position's summation?  That's not arguing with the force of reason, that is evidence that you think that your position cannot stand without adding an ''ad hominem''. 

<user_id=Unscintillating>
Once again your post uses policy words such as ""burden"" without a sense that these are anything other than superficial arguments.  WP:Arguments to avoid discusses the problem with ""just pointing at a policy"".  ""While merely citing a policy or guideline may give other editors a clue as to what the reasoning is, it does not explain specifically how the policy applies to the discussion at hand."" 

",1,"The discussion revolves around the inclusion of a Mathematics section in a Wikipedia article, specifically dealing with the game Microsoft Hearts. The main points of contention are whether the mathematical analysis falls under the Wikipedia policy WP:CALC (which allows for the inclusion of basic calculations without citation), the verifiability of the claims made in the section, and the appropriateness of including user-generated content as a reliable source.

Chain-of-Thought Analysis:

1. Jasper Deng argues against the inclusion of the Mathematics section, stating that the analysis does not fall under WP:CALC because it is not basic arithmetic and that the claims are not verifiable by readers without sufficient mathematical knowledge. Jasper also raises concerns about the reliability of user-generated content and the application of WP:DUE, suggesting that without reliable sources, the section should not be given weight.

2. Unscintillating seems to be in favor of including some form of the Mathematics section but agrees with Jasper that the win rate should not be included without a reliable source. Unscintillating also mentions an editor's personal data collection over 7000 games as a source of information, although acknowledging it is not a WP:RS (Wikipedia Reliable Source).

3. Lynton1 defends the inclusion of the Mathematics section, arguing that the results are obvious and verifiable, and offers to provide screenshots as evidence. Lynton1 also attempts to clarify that the section is about probability theory, not game theory, and believes the section adds value to the article.

4. Renamed user 2560613081 provides a critique of the section's quality, pointing out issues with clarity, subjective language, and policy violations. This user emphasizes the importance of clear and policy-compliant contributions.

5. The discussion includes references to various Wikipedia policies and guidelines, such as WP:CALC, WP:V (Verifiability), WP:DUE (Due Weight), and WP:5P (Five Pillars). However, there is a lack of consensus on how these policies apply to the situation at hand.

6. The dialogue includes some instances of personal remarks and a focus on the behavior of the editors rather than solely on the content of the edit, which detracts from the overall quality of the argumentation.

7. The discussion shows a mix of well-reasoned arguments concerning Wikipedia policies and the nature of the content in question, alongside less constructive elements such as personal disagreements and a lack of clear consensus.

Considering the above points, the discussion demonstrates a range of argument quality. Some participants provide clear and policy-driven reasoning, while others engage in less productive exchanges. The discussion also reflects a lack of agreement on the interpretation of Wikipedia policies, which is a common challenge in collaborative editing environments.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Peacemaker67>
We should fix the article from this point. I agree there is some undue weight, lack of balance, POV etc, but some of your above comments also suggest POV and un-wiki language. I propose to continue the process I have already started, adding properly sourced material and challenging all POV and unbalanced material. BTW, Cohen is a WP:RS, his work is supported by Hoare , and your comment on him is completely unjustified, his work is part of a series by a highly respected team. He is used as a source by many other authorities on the period.

<user_id=Juraj Budak>
To my best knowledge, P. Cohen is not historian. He is a dentist, therefore an amateur. At its best, it's a tertiary source.

That old chestnut again! The work is reliable, published and scholarly. Tomasevich was an economist by training, but he is one of the most authoritative sources on Yugoslavia in WW2. Give me a break.

<user_id=Peacemaker67>
Also, I cannot understand your English composition in a number of places. Please carefully check your comments so that others can understand what you are saying. For example, you meant 'weak' not 'week' when you mentioned Matkovic. Also, why is Matkovic 'weak'?

I am very concerned that you think that the description of Pavelic as a politician is somehow inappropriate. He was a member of a political party, represented it in the Yugoslav legislature and subsequently became the head of a Croatian government. He also practised law, which makes him a lawyer. He was also a terrorist. You don't get to choose which of his occupations are listed in the article, that is the opposite of NPOV.

<user_id=Peacemaker67>
I withdraw my comments about Cohen, and have struck them through on that basis. At WP:RSN, User:Fifelfoo produced a review from an appropriate scholarly journal which definitely questioned its reliability, however, Marko Attila Hoare indicates on his blog his good opinion of Cohen and his book, and that's good enough for me. I believe it is reliable for some specific facts, but only if used very carefully, and only if taken to WP:RSN first.

<user_id=Thewanderer>
'Genocide in Satellite Croatia'' by Edmond Paris is in no way, shape, or form a reliable source. There are multiple reasons for this:
The publisher, American Institute for Balkan Affairs, was a Serbian nationalist printing house based in Cleveland. Other authors printed by this group within a year of Paris' work include Lazo M Kostić (member of the Commissary Government under the Nazis) and Sergije M. Živanović (Chetnik colonel).
Edmond Paris was not a historian. Period. He was a ""journalist"" singularly known for his virulent anti-Catholic writing and his ""history"" of the NDH.
The work contains no primary references.

<user_id=Juraj Budak>
Yes, that book (Genocide in Satellite Croatia) is a reliable source for being widely accepted by scholars as a reliable source. Just simple Google Book search gives a good insight about the book acceptance as a scholar source. This book has ample of primary resources: German and Yugoslav WWI archives documents, the war survivors' testimonies, H. Neubacher's Sonderauftrag Suedost 1940-1945, etc. The great German historian M. Broszat (Der Kroatische Ustascha Staat) quoted three times Paris. Make assessment of your statement as  did.

<user_id=Juraj Budak>
As per your assessment of the book, I removed Cohen from the bibliography list.

<user_id=Peacemaker67>
What about Matkovic? Why is Matkovic weak?

<user_id=Juraj Budak>
Matkovic is a provincial scholar which started his academic career at the age of 50. His book about Independent State of Croatia (ISC) is almost unknown to international academia and scholars. He is referenced in the article 23 (!!) times compared to world-renown scholar Martin Broszat (referenced only once!)  whose Der Kroatische Ustascha Staat is referenced in almost any serious work about the WWII and the Independent State of Croatia. Matkovic plays with ""International recognition of the ISC"" and ""Establishment of the ISC borders"". First of all, the ISC never had any sovereignity over the claimed territory for a) their bureaucracy never ever entered some of the claimed by ISC territories for being controlled by the Serbian Chetniks of Yugoslav Partisans b) being fully occupied by Germans and Italians who were above the ISC ""laws"" and c) the ISC was forced to fully pay the occupation cost to Italy and Germany. Broszat, as a serious scholar, did not pay any attention to the ""sovereignity"" of the ISC nor her ""international recognitions"". The maps of Balkans provided by this scholar show that the ISC was split 40%:60% between Italy and Germany. At the beginning of 1943 more than 40% of the ISC was firmly in the hands of the Yugoslav Partisans. All of this is not visible in that Matkovic's book.

<user_id=Juraj Budak>
My Croatia is dignity, honesty, justice, and pride, which is not Pavelic's ISC nor his HOP which gets 0.1% of the current Croatian population support. You cannot be neutral and honest, neutral and just. You can be only honest and just, then neutral within the limits of honesty and justice. This is an encyclopaedia (amateuristic and naive, but still encyclopaedia), not an Ustashe blog.

''Comment by User:Peacemaker67'''

<user_id=Peacemaker67>
''Opposed'''. The proposal to return to a version of this article from two years ago is not appropriate because the 2010 version is itself full of grammatical and factual errors, is inconsistent with multiple WP policies such as WP:LEAD, WP:NPOV and WP:LABEL and needs lot of work itself. For example, the 2010 version has citations from the 'pavelic papers' and a self-published web book, uses the discredited '750,000 killed at Jasenovac' figure, is all over the place chronology-wise, and is generally pretty bad. This appears to be an attempt to remove, in one fell swoop, all material that this editor considers is contrary to some personal sense of justice and honesty that they believe should be reflected in this article (see comment immediately above). This attitude is not appropriate for WP, which this editor states is 'amateuristic and naive'. I have commenced working to get this article up to WP standard, potentially to get it to FAC, and have already taken sources to WP:RSN, discussed usage of WP:LABELs with other editors and have made properly sourced edits. I welcome others who also wish improve the article, but this 'back to the future' approach to revising the article is a retrograde step in my view.

<user_id=Juraj Budak>
''Comment'''. Not a single problem related to the 2010 article version was ever addressed or discussed. One user started changing that version without justifying his/her changes. Pavelic Papers are not 'a self-published web book', rather a collection of the WWII time American Counterintelligence Corps reports about Pavelic which are accepted by scholars as valuable sources. ''... uses the discredited '750,000 killed at Jasenovac'', it's the Yugoslav government estimate referenced by many historians, among them by Martin Broszat. Other disqualifications are arbitrary for having all the 2010 version strictly covered by credible and scholarly accepted references. No one complained about the grammar or the factual accuracy.

<user_id=Peacemaker67>
I wasn't on WP in 2010 or I would have been on here doing just that. I didn't say the 'pavelic papers' were a self-published web book, they are primary source material. The web book is separate. The 100,000 figure for Jasenovac is not definitive, but it is the best approximation based on current evidence.

<user_id=Thewanderer>
Matkovic is one of the preeminent historians of 20th century Croatian history, and your criticisms of his work seem to speak to your own POV rather than the unreliability of him as a source.

<user_id=Thewanderer>
-International recognition and establishment of the NDH borders: The NDH was internationally recognized by fellow Axis members, de facto recognized by several neutral states, and had low-level relations with others. The NDH had legal settled borders with all of its neighbours, recognized internationally by those states with which the NDH maintained recognition. How is writing about any of this POV? Matkovic and other contemporary historians have studied this because the Cold War/communist period historiography summarily ignored these topics. They are obviously important.

<user_id=Thewanderer>
Polemics about some inconsequential political party have absolutely nothing to with this article and should be avoided in the future if you'd like to be taken seriously.

<user_id=Thewanderer>
The 750,000 figure relates to all casualties in Yugoslavia as a result of the Axis forces. The same list contains 59,188 people killed at Jasenovac. Of course Martin Broszat wouldn't know this, because he '''never even saw the list''' as it was only published in 1989. Any historians who are reporting this now must be pretty awful at their job, as this is common contemporary knowledge.

<user_id=68.98.165.98>
''Go back to the 2010 version'''. Fix the broken links, improve grammar where necessary, remove the 'statesman' (statesman my foot!) from the info box. The Encyclopedia of the holocaust accepts 600,000 deaths in the Jasenovac konzlager. Croatian Ustashi did not left any bookkeeping of the Jasenovac inmates deaths. They destroyed any evidence they could destroy, for being vicious and true criminals. All we have are various estimates and all the estimates must be regarded equal and with respect. The victimized people there have the full right to estimate the number of those who died there.

<user_id=Peacemaker67>
Please. What POV rot. The 'statesman' reference was one of the first things I removed. The 600,000 deaths at Jasenovac isn't even in the mainstream scholarly historiography these days, give me a break. The academic consensus is around 300,000 Serbs in the whole NDH. This stuff is as bad as glorifying Pavelic. I've already started getting rid of unreliable sources and material and adding properly sourced material, this RfC is pointless and POV.

<user_id=Potočnik>
Ramet said it best: ""The figure of more than a million dead is already horrific. Subsequent claims that 700,000 Serbs died at Jasenovac alone make a mockery of the sufferings of all of Yugoslavia's peoples and reduce the tabulation of the dead to absurdity."" ◅

<user_id=Peacemaker67>
I have now restored it per the above amendments to my position.

<user_id=Peacemaker67>
Since this proposal was made, there have been over 150 edits of this article by 10 different users, almost all of which have made improvements. The article is already significantly improved from its state on 29 August. There is still much to do. As a result, I consider it would be an even bigger waste of time and resources to revert to a version from 2010.

<user_id=Peacemaker67>
Juraj, with your permission I would like to deal with your listed concerns on a line by line basis underneath each one to ensure each one is considered as we improve the article. Are you comfortable with me doing that?

<user_id=Peacemaker67>
Due to lack of response, I have done just that.

<user_id=Peacemaker67>
Juraj Budak, if you do not want your shopping list of complaints about this article addressed, you are going about it the right way. I asked for your permission to deal with your comments in the way I did (line by line), and after over two weeks with no response from you, I reasonably assumed that I could go ahead. You have now removed all of my comments and restored the tagging of the article. This makes it appear no-one has attempted to address your concerns. Not only is it poor wikibehaviour, but it is counterproductive in terms of improving the article. There is no consensus to return this article to its state in 2010, so drop the stick and try improving it yourself instead of whingeing about it.

<user_id=Joy>
This could have been tagged with , but because it's also in Croatian, I used the more generic  instead.

<user_id=Peacemaker67>
Given what Timbouctou has said, I think we should be pretty circumspect about using this source for anything important, particularly opinion-type material, that isn't corroborated elsewhere. It really is a less-than gold-plated source, despite the involvement of Jareb (who is clearly a reliable source in my view, he contributes chapters to books edited by Sabrina Ramet for example).

",0,"Chain-of-Thoughts reasoning:

1. **Use of Sources**: The discussion revolves around the reliability of various sources. User Peacemaker67 argues for the use of scholarly sources and challenges POV (Point of View) material. They also acknowledge the need to use certain sources carefully and suggest taking them to WP:RSN (Wikipedia: Reliable Sources Noticeboard) for verification. This indicates an understanding of Wikipedia's standards for reliable sourcing and a commitment to maintaining the integrity of the article.

2. **Expertise and Background of Authors**: There is a debate about the qualifications of certain authors, such as P. Cohen and Matkovic. User Juraj Budak questions Cohen's reliability due to his background as a dentist, while Peacemaker67 defends Cohen's work based on its scholarly publication and support from other authorities. The discussion about Matkovic's qualifications and the weight given to his work compared to other scholars like Martin Broszat shows a critical examination of sources based on the authors' expertise and recognition in the field.

3. **Factual Accuracy and Estimates**: The participants discuss the accuracy of historical figures, such as the number of deaths at Jasenovac. User Thewanderer corrects misconceptions about the figures and cites contemporary knowledge, showing an effort to ensure factual accuracy in the article.

4. **Language and Composition**: Peacemaker67 points out language and composition errors, emphasizing the importance of clarity and precision in contributions, which is crucial for the quality of the discussion and the article.

5. **POV and Neutrality**: There is a strong emphasis on maintaining a Neutral Point of View (NPOV), with Peacemaker67 particularly highlighting the importance of representing all aspects of a historical figure's life without bias. This aligns with Wikipedia's core content policies.

6. **Collaboration and Improvement**: Peacemaker67 shows a willingness to collaborate and improve the article line by line, addressing concerns raised by Juraj Budak. This collaborative approach is essential for the quality of Wikipedia articles.

7. **Historical Context and Interpretation**: The discussion includes arguments about the historical context, such as the sovereignty and international recognition of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). User Thewanderer provides context about international relations and recognition, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the topic.

8. **Emotional Language and Bias**: User Juraj Budak's comment about Croatian dignity and pride introduces an emotional and potentially biased perspective, which is less conducive to a neutral and scholarly discussion.

Overall, the discussion demonstrates a high level of engagement with the subject matter, a commitment to Wikipedia's standards for sourcing and neutrality, and a willingness to collaborate for the improvement of the article. However, there are instances of emotional language and bias that detract from the overall quality.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

I would observe that the revert in the case of the McCain has left the article in an unsatisfactory state since it has removed the context for the action having occurred such that the reason for including the mention of the event appears meaningless.  In the case of the USS William P. Lawrence, the reverts have left the article in a better condition.  If I have this right, the consequences of the actions in each case have been stated in a single sentence. As I understand it, coat-racking is a matter of ""undue weight"". To quote from WP:COAT: ""A coatrack article is a Wikipedia article that ostensibly discusses its nominal subject, but instead focuses on another subject entirely."" I have suggested that the consequences of the act are of some significance to the article and, a single sentence of relevance to the subject article does not unduly shift the focus of the article. IMHO Regards

<user_id=Kendall-K1>
I agree that this should go back in.

<user_id=Davemck>
I also agree.

<user_id=Cinderella157>
Hi, @ and @, this is a centralised discussion that also relates to a near identical issue wrt USS William P. Lawrence. It would be useful to make your views clear and explicit in this broader context.  Do you also agree that the material there should go back too? Regards

<user_id=Kendall-K1>
I see there has already been a partial removal of material and a source citation. I have reverted this. I suggest we leave the material as-is until we arrive at consensus on the wording.

<user_id=Cinderella157>
To say something is ""not as bad"" is not the same as saying it is good.

<user_id=Davemck>
s reasoning that this article is solely about the ship, not China's reaction, seems to me rather absurd (his ""it's just too obvious that I'm in the right"" is an alarm bell). Warships' ''raison d'être'' is as instruments of foreign policy, and that would reasonably include both their activities and foreign governments' reactions to them. Certainly the issues could be treated at greater length elsewhere, but a sentence or two here with a wikilink to the fuller article is entirely appropriate. In any case, the consensus for including mention of China's reaction seems pretty clear by now: numerous editors vs. one. And if Wingwraith persists in edit warring, WP has well-developed procedures to deal with that.

<user_id=Wingwraith>
To be clear, I never said or implied that, what I said and was in fact trying to say was that my edits are better than the edits that  came up with.

<user_id=Wingwraith>
That's not my reasoning which, as you unwittingly intimate, is just besides the point. The question is the inclusion of state reactions to the ships' operational activities that have been documented in this article - which for good reasons (e.g. WP:COAT) has never been done before and for which neither you nor anybody else in this discussion has provided any good reason to justify this exception to the practice. As I implied in the preceding sub-category, since the state reaction pertain to the FONOPS, it belongs there and not to this article. You say that ""Certainly the issues could be treated at greater length elsewhere, but a sentence or two here with a wikilink to the fuller article is entirely appropriate""; in that case, what would you have to object to this edit? Your final point about the consensus is misleading: it was about ""the context for the action"" not the inclusion of state reactions to the ships' operational activities.

<user_id=Wingwraith>
They're evidently good enough to you because you haven't reverted them.

<user_id=Cinderella157>
I have not done so because I believe it would be inappropriate to replicate such behavior at this juncture.

<user_id=Wingwraith>
Why the wait? Why don't we just debate whatever it is that we need to debate ""at this juncture"" and get it over with already?

<user_id=Cinderella157>
The post which starts this section (and also mentioned in the previous section) indicates both a lack of context and the appropriateness of mentioning the consequences. @, you acknowledge a consensus wrt context but not consequences yet there is nothing in the consensus that would support your view wrt one but not both - pls see WP:NOTGETTINGIT. Being the case, what do you think would be a reasonable and appropriate response from the community at this juncture in regard to actioning this consensus?

<user_id=Wingwraith>
I revised this article in the same way that I revised the Lawrence article which lead you to say that ""In the case of the USS William P. Lawrence, the reverts have left the article in a better condition"" so unless there's something specific about that which you object to it would just be a waste of time for me (and you) to continue this discussion.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Context and Consequences: User Cinderella157 raises a concern about the removal of context and consequences from the article, arguing that it leaves the article in an unsatisfactory state. This is a valid point, as context is crucial for understanding the significance of events in an encyclopedic entry.

2. Coatracking and Undue Weight: The discussion involves the concept of coatracking, which is about focusing on a subject different from the nominal subject of the article. Cinderella157 argues that a single sentence does not shift the focus unduly, which is a reasonable assertion if the sentence is indeed relevant and concise.

3. Foreign Policy Relevance: User Davemck brings up the point that warships are instruments of foreign policy and that reactions to their activities are relevant to their purpose. This is a strong argument for including such information in the article, as long as it is done with appropriate weight.

4. Consensus and Edit Warring: There is a mention of consensus among several users versus one, and the procedures to deal with edit warring are referenced. This indicates an awareness of Wikipedia's guidelines and a willingness to adhere to them.

5. Specific Objections and Revisions: User Wingwraith defends their edits and asks for specific objections to be debated. This is a constructive approach, as it invites direct feedback and the opportunity to resolve the issue through discussion.

6. Community Response and Actioning Consensus: Cinderella157 asks about a reasonable and appropriate response from the community regarding the consensus. This shows a desire to move forward constructively based on the consensus reached.

Overall, the discussion shows a good understanding of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, a willingness to engage in constructive debate, and an effort to reach a consensus. The arguments presented are generally coherent, relevant, and show a concern for maintaining the quality and integrity of the article.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.",8.0

Tagging for primary soruces

<user_id=Aprock>
The new section '''Ethnic heterogenity''', appears to be based on primary sources.  Please help improve the section by locating independent secondary sources which establish the weight of views expressed in the primary sources.

<user_id=Acadēmica Orientālis>
The source is a literature review and not a primary source.

<user_id=Aprock>
The content you added just cites primary sources through the review.  In fact, the actual synthesis of the review is ignored in the content you added: ''However, our main conclusion from this survey is that most studies do not point to a quantitatively important role for ethnic diversity in shaping natives’ preferences for redistribution. In most studies, the association is much weaker than for other factors such as own income (current or expected) or beliefs about the role of effort versus luck in determining this income.  Moreover, it seems that the sizeable negative association between ethnic diversity and support for redistribution that is sometimes found in U.S. studies does not generalize to Canada or Europe. However, the evidence for countries other than the U.S. is scarce so far, and there is certainly need for further research.''.  Based on this, it appears that the section has significant POV issues.

<user_id=Acadēmica Orientālis>
All reviews cites primary sources so that is not a reason for exclusion. I have mentioned that the effect is weak.

<user_id=Aprock>
Picking and choosing which of the reviewed primary sources to highlight is WP:SYNTHESIS.  Ignoring the actual conclusion (most studies do not point to a quantitatively important role for ethnic diversity) to instead promote your own interpretation (statistically significant but relatively weak negative relationship) is a perfect example of POV editing.

<user_id=Acadēmica Orientālis>
The introductory statement also states that the effect is sometimes quite strong in the US which I have not mentioned.

<user_id=Acadēmica Orientālis>
Do you have an alternative formulation? We could quote the actual text if you prefer.

<user_id=Aprock>
Probably the best way to approach a technical review would be to use the '''Non-technical summary''' on page three as a basis for the content:

<user_id=Acadēmica Orientālis>
Sure, as a basis, but it is not particularly clear in places like how individual attitudes and behavior are affected.

<user_id=Aprock>
If those details are not mentioned in the lay summary, they don't need to be in wikipedia.

<user_id=Acadēmica Orientālis>
No such rule. If something is unclear it should be clarified.

<user_id=Aprock>
When you pick and choose what parts of a source to include, and what parts to exclude, that is synthesis.  Using generally accepted summary sections of a source as a basis for content is the straightforward way to approach the issue.  Comparing the content that you inserted with the lay summary above, there is a clear disconnect indicating POV issues with what you added.  Instead of advocating for highlighting whatever portions of the review that you are most interested in promoting, I suggest you start from scratch with the lay summary.

<user_id=Acadēmica Orientālis>
Using your argumentation everything except a complete quote of the whole paper or the whole summary is a synthesis. There is no policy that states that only certain portions of a study are allowed. A summary should be a basis but if it is unclear this should be fixed.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. <user_id=Aprock> raises a concern about the use of primary sources in the new section ""Ethnic heterogeneity"" and suggests improving the section by adding independent secondary sources to establish the weight of the views expressed in the primary sources. This is a valid point, as Wikipedia guidelines prefer secondary sources for interpretive claims to ensure neutrality and verifiability.

2. <user_id=Acadēmica Orientālis> counters by stating that the source in question is a literature review, which is not a primary source. This is also a valid point, as literature reviews are considered secondary sources since they synthesize information from multiple primary studies.

3. <user_id=Aprock> then argues that the content added from the review selectively cites primary sources and ignores the main conclusion of the review, which could lead to a biased representation of the information (POV issues). This is a strong argument because it emphasizes the importance of representing the source's overall conclusions rather than cherry-picking data that may support a particular viewpoint.

4. <user_id=Acadēmica Orientālis> acknowledges the mention of the weak effect but does not address the concern about the potential misrepresentation of the review's overall conclusion. This response is weaker because it does not fully engage with the criticism raised by <user_id=Aprock>.

5. <user_id=Aprock> suggests using the non-technical summary of the review as a basis for the Wikipedia content to avoid POV issues. This is a constructive suggestion as it aims to simplify the technical content for Wikipedia readers and ensure that the representation of the source is balanced and accurate.

6. <user_id=Acadēmica Orientālis> argues that if something in the summary is unclear, it should be clarified, which is a reasonable point. However, the insistence on potentially adding more detail than what is presented in the non-technical summary could lead to the same issue of selective representation that <user_id=Aprock> initially raised.

7. <user_id=Aprock> emphasizes the importance of avoiding synthesis by sticking closely to the source's summary, which is a strong argument in favor of maintaining Wikipedia's standards for neutrality and verifiability.

8. <user_id=Acadēmica Orientālis> argues that not all content must be a direct quote from the paper or summary, which is true. However, the concern about synthesis and POV is not fully addressed in this response.

Overall, the discussion shows an engagement with Wikipedia's content policies and guidelines, with both parties presenting arguments related to the use of sources, representation of information, and neutrality. <user_id=Aprock> consistently emphasizes the importance of adhering to Wikipedia's standards for neutrality and avoiding synthesis, while <user_id=Acadēmica Orientālis> focuses on the legitimacy of using a literature review as a source but does not fully address the concerns about potential bias.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.0",7.0

The '''rank being second''' is a fringe theory because, as I said, is based on estimate figures. The last census was in 2010. All other figures are estimates. If the estimates only differ by 300 out of 2.7 million, Taichung being second is for sure a fringe theory, as the sources I cited suggests otherwise.

<user_id=Multivariable>
So now you're saying figures that Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior put out aren't reliable enough? You don't get to pick and choose which sources you want to acknowledge: up-to-date government figures & announcements  vs. unrelated news articles citing conventional (and perhaps outdated) wisdom (see WP:CHERRYPICK). And you certainly don't get to decide whether something is a fringe theory (WP:OR). The MOI announcement dated 4 August 2017 states:

<user_id=Multivariable>
Also, you've been changing your own argument. Initially, you posted that you didn't want any mention of Taichung's population in the lede (due to MOS:INTRO). Then you said the ranking couldn't be mentioned because there wasn't a reliable source. But now, it's alright to mention as long as Taichung is ranked 3rd instead of 2nd? ;

<user_id=Szqecs>
Yes I am saying that. If, say, in the past month 300 people in Taichung went hiking and died, and they have no relatives so their deaths are unknown, they would still be included in these estimate figures. The only way to know for sure which has a higher population is to do a census. I haven't changed my argument, but maybe named this section inaccurately. The population number is fine but not the rank, because the difference is 0.01%. They are effectively the same.

<user_id=Szqecs>
Let me remind you that I am not arguing about which city is actually bigger. I am arguing what should be written and in what manner. If ""outdated"" wisdom is still prevalent, articles still need to reflect it.

<user_id=Szqecs>
And I already cited 3 sources saying Kaohsiung is second. Who are you to say those are invalid?

<user_id=Multivariable>
The most recent, up-to-date government statistics say Taichung's population has exceeded that of Kaohsiung. The articles you cited make '''no''' mention of Taichung at all. I already explained above why government figures/announcements are more verifiable than unrelated news articles about typhoons. And why do you consider Taiwanese government figures invalid? The burden is on you to show that the articles you cited are referencing a more appropriate or up-to-date source (WP:PROVEIT). Also, why keep removing ''any'' mention of population in the lead? You already agreed that the issue was stating Taichung's rank, not about mentioning population in general.

<user_id=Szqecs>
WP:VERIFY doesn't even mention government announcements. I don't know where you got that idea. Also you clearly ignored my previous reply. Per WP:UNDUE, ""Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources"". If you absolutely must mention rank, you must write it in a way that reflects the fact that it is not a widespread view.

<user_id=Multivariable>
Exactly! All I've asked is: If you have a better source than a MOI government announcement, please provide it. You keep bringing up articles about typhoons that don't mention Taichung (or its population or rank) at all. How you consider these articles to be ""significant viewpoints"" is unclear.

<user_id=Szqecs>
What do you mean by ""better""? Per Neutrality below WP:YTCOPYRIGHT ""All articles must adhere to NPOV, fairly representing all majority and significant-minority viewpoints published by reliable sources, in rough proportion to the prominence of each view."" I don't know how else to explain this to you. Kaohsiung being second is a significant-minority view, if not majority, and it contradicts with the proposed statement that Taichung is second. If you must write about it, you must reflect that.

<user_id=Multivariable>
Continue reading: ""If there is disagreement between sources, use in-text attribution: 'John Smith argues that X, while Paul Jones maintains that Y,' followed by an inline citation."" Ok, ''who'' maintains that Kaohsiung still has the 2nd largest population in Taiwan and ''why'' is it significant? Where are they getting this view from, and (in light of the recent announcement) why are they maintaining that it's ''not'' Taichung?

<user_id=Szqecs>
Or just not mention it and avoid all the trouble. As I said, it is already in the infobox.

<user_id=Multivariable>
Oh, it's OK to state that Taichung is ranked 2nd in the infobox, but if it's mentioned elsewhere, all of the sudden it's WP:NPOV, WP:UNDUE, WP:FRINGE, etc.? I'm fine with all the ""trouble""; I've already provided the sources to state it. Like I said, the burden is on you to state otherwise.

<user_id=Szqecs>
Yes. Putting it in the infobox is giving it little weight so as to not be undue. Simply stating it is second would be giving it undue weight, unless it is written with balanced views per WP:BALANCE.

<user_id=Multivariable>
I think we might need a third opinion here (WP:3O). If you don't mind, I'm going to go ahead and request one.

<user_id=Multivariable>
At the very least, I think the population should be mentioned in the lead. And I think the statement that it's the second largest city in Taiwan is fine, based on the MOI reference cited by Multivariable.

<user_id=Phlar>
subject."" You're trying to argue ''against'' a government source that says Taichung's population is now ranked 2nd in Taiwan. To counter, you need a source that says, ""Yes, the MOI released new figures that show that Taichung's population is now larger than Kaohsiung's, but (I disagree/the figures are wrong) because X."" Otherwise, this is just you being unhappy about what a source states, saying that it needs to be ""balanced"", while ''still'' refusing to provide a relevant source to support your opinion. Unless you do so, there's really no point in continuing to argue about NPOV, undue weight, fringe theories, etc. when you continually refuse to provide a reliable source to begin with.

Or, you could just quote your super reliable government announcement and write: ""As of July 2017, Taichung city's population reached 2,778,182 people, its first time passing Kaohsiung city's 2,777,873 people. Of the 6 special municipalities (and all counties/cities), its population is second only to New Taipei's."" If you are so attached to this source why not just quote it directly?

<user_id=Multivariable>
Sounds good, I'll just cite it!

<user_id=Multivariable>
This  is extraneous wording. There's no need to mention Kaohsiung, its population, how many municipalities there are in Taiwan, or New Taipei. Like you mentioned previously, this info isn't notable enough to be in the lead section per MOS:INTRO. However, I am glad we were able to come to a consensus that Taichung's population rank is OK to be included in the lead section.

<user_id=Szqecs>
Yes there is. The rank isn't notable at all but since you insist on writing about it you must write it accurately.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Source Reliability and Relevance**: User Multivariable argues for the inclusion of Taichung's population rank based on the most recent government statistics, which is a strong argument because government sources are generally considered reliable for demographic data. User Szqecs challenges the reliability of these figures, suggesting that they are estimates and could be inaccurate due to unforeseen events like deaths. However, Szqecs does not provide a stronger source to counter the government statistics, which weakens their argument.

2. **Consistency of Argument**: User Szqecs initially argues against mentioning Taichung's population in the lead due to the Manual of Style guidelines, then shifts to questioning the reliability of sources, and finally to the argument that the rank is not notable enough. This inconsistency weakens Szqecs's position, as it appears they are searching for reasons to exclude the information rather than having a solid, consistent rationale.

3. **Adherence to Wikipedia Policies**: Both users reference various Wikipedia policies such as WP:VERIFY, WP:UNDUE, WP:OR, WP:NPOV, and WP:BALANCE. User Multivariable's use of these policies is more aligned with the intent of the policies, advocating for the inclusion of up-to-date and verifiable information from a government source. User Szqecs's interpretation of these policies to exclude the information seems less aligned with the spirit of providing accurate and current information.

4. **Compromise and Resolution**: Towards the end of the discussion, User Szqecs suggests a compromise by quoting the government source directly, which is a constructive move. However, User Multivariable points out that the proposed wording by Szqecs is extraneous and not in line with the Manual of Style guidelines, which is a valid point for maintaining the quality and conciseness of the article.

5. **Request for Third Opinion**: User Multivariable suggests getting a third opinion, which is a good strategy for resolving disputes on Wikipedia. It shows a willingness to seek additional input and adhere to community consensus.

Overall, User Multivariable presents a stronger argument by consistently advocating for the inclusion of verifiable and current information from a reliable government source, while also showing flexibility and a willingness to seek consensus. User Szqecs, while raising some valid points about the potential for estimates to be inaccurate, does not provide a stronger source to support their position and shifts arguments throughout the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Factual inaccuracy

<user_id=Miradre>
Slrubenstein, why are you restoring factually incorrect claims? You can read the original source yourself here and see tht the claim is incorrect. That the claim is the first is not mentioned, or that the author was unaware of modern genetics, or that the observation was based on animal husbandry. '' Miradre''  E-mail)

<user_id=Miradre>
In fact, if you look at the previous page (227) one can see that the author states that others had the idea before him! '' Miradre''  E-mail)

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
I have no idea what you are talking about. The claim is mentiond, it is the earliest published example, and your suggestion that the author was aware of modern genetics is so laughable I suggest you wait until you finish high school before trying to write encyclopedia articles.    |

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
Moreover, if you think the sentence is inaccurate, the solution is not to put up an inaccuracy dispute tag.    |

<user_id=Maunus>
Miradre is right that you cannot source a claim about a book being the first to mention something to the book itself. The question of whether he was aware of modern genetics also needs to be sourced to a reliable source. All in all the article is in a dire need of good secondary sources. The claim about the theory having achived wider support is for example also cited only to partisan primary sources - how about someone actually looked for some secondary or tertiary sources to back up their claims here?·

<user_id=Maunus>
Here are some ideas: .·

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
It won't be hard to add a secondary source that he was the first scholar to propose this, or at least the first contemporary scholar.  That he was not aware of modern genetics is something we just need to add I would argue in order to have a readible encyclopedia article; given his argument that inbreeding produces congenital defects, the imaginary average 21st century reader might well think that he believed this because of genetic research; it only makes sense to clarify that this was not the case.  I do not see this as original research or synth, I see it as proper contextualization.

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
But Maunus, if you want to add these additional sources, by all means - I agree you would be improving the article.    |

<user_id=Maunus>
I don't see how someone writing 150 years ago is more contemporary than those writing immediately before him (e.g. Morgan and McLennan and E. B. Tylor who coined the phrase ""Marry out or die out"")... Adding the bit about genetics is begging the question and tacit WP:SYNTH if it is not supported by a source.  I am not going to add those sources - but I suggest both you and Miradre look them over instead of edit warring and namecalling.·

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
Where did I claim that Maine was more contemporary than Morgan or McLennan?    |

<user_id=Miradre>
The text you are restoring is claiming that Maine was the first despite that he himself states otherwise in the source. '' Miradre''  E-mail)

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
Maine does not claim that Morgan or Mclellan were explaining exogamy based on the deleterious biological consequences of inbreeding.  What specifically are you referring to?  I've read it, I do not see any place where he is attributing this explanation to Morgan or McLennan.

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
If you have any source that claims that Morgan or Mclennan or anyone else made this claim before Maine, by all means add that view and provide a citation, but Maine himself did not say this.  Maunus provided links to recent secondary sources - if any of them attributes this claim to someone other than Maine, I would be all for adding it into the article.    |

<user_id=Miradre>
Page 226, ""On the other hand, Morgan... ...He supposes that primitive man very early discovered the evils of close inbreeding and that all the early transformations of human society were the result of a constant struggle to prevent these evils"". '' Miradre''  E-mail)

<user_id=Miradre>
Furthermore, the text still makes the claim that Maine developed this based on observing ""animal husbandry"" which is not in the source. Also, more generally, primary sources are of course not suited for statements like ""first instance of a theory"". Claiming that is OR.'' Miradre''  E-mail)

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
I appreciate your providing a specific quote, maybe this can help us clear things up.  But the evils of inbreeding are not the same thing as congenital birth defects.  Lewis Henry Morgan no doubt viewed incest as a sin, and argued that there was a drive within culture to evolve to higher forms.  Evil is a moral claim and if Maine or Morgan meant something more, you will need to provide a quote that says so.  maunus provided links to several secondary sources, can you find a quote in any of them?  In the quote you provide, Maine is not saying that Morgan's explanation for the incest taboo was congenital birth defects.  Maine is not saying that this was Morgan's explanation.
Also, Maine does talk about animal husbandry and on the very page cited.    |

<user_id=Miradre>
Congential birth defects are of course never explicitly mentioned by Maine either. ""Selected the wild forms of certain animals for domestication"" is of course not the same as making observations of congenital birth defects in ""animal husbandry"". Finally, again, primary sources are not suited for discovering who was the first since this is OR based on them. '' Miradre''  E-mail)

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
Selected the wild forms of certain animals for domestication is of course precisely what ""animal husbandry"" means. ""I cannot see why the men who selected the wild forms of certain animals for domestication should not find out that children of unsound constitution were born of nearly related parents ... "" — it is precisely providing this explanation for exogamy that Maine says is his contribution. But I promise you I will add a secondary surce tomorrow.  In the mantime by all means do add your secondary sources on Maine, Morgan etc.    |

<user_id=Miradre>
You restored the material, you have the burden of evidence. See WP:BURDEN. Also, you made an incorrect citation. A correct one is ""I cannot see why men who discovered the use of fire and selected the wild forms of certain animals for domestication and of vegetables for cultivation..."" Thus, he is talking about general human cleverness. Not observation of congenital birth defects in ""animal husbandry"". '' Miradre''  E-mail)

<user_id=Maunus>
When motivating the prohibition of incest 'biologically', one generally thinks of the danger connected with the increased probability of homozygosity in incest, namely the manifestation of harmful recessive characters. The main supporters of this argument were Morgan (1877), Maine (1883), and Westermarck (1889). (Bischof 1975 Comparrative Ethnology of Incest Avoidance in Robert Fox (ed.)Biosocial Anthropology )·

<user_id=Maunus>
Another theory, championed generations ago by Lewis H. Morgan and others, and not without defenders today, is that incest was defined and prohibited because inbreeding causes biological degeneration.4 This theory is so plausible as to seem self-evident, but it is wrong for all that. In the first place, inbreeding as such does not cause degeneration; the testimony of biologists is conclusive on this point. To be sure, inbreeding intensifies the inheritance of traits, good or bad. (The Definition and Prohibition of Incest. Leslie A. White. American Anthropologist , New Series, Vol. 50, No. 3, Part 1 (Jul. - Sep., 1948), pp. 416-435 )·

<user_id=Miradre>
Just a comment regarding the last claim. Sure, it is possible to construct a theoretical population where inbreeding causing increased frequency of homozygosity is not a harmful like a population without recessive genetic diseases. In the real world recessive diseases exist and inbreeding increases mortality in humans. There are also other dangers beside increased pure homozygosity like that a small gene pool of Major histocompatibility complex variants in a population increases the risk of resistant diseases. These are important argument that Slrubenstein constantly have deleted, apparently because they do not fit his the-incest-taboo-is-just-a-social construction view. '' Miradre''  E-mail)

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
Yes, I have already addressed this.  Are you ignoring what I wrote?  Or do you prefer to fight rather than collaborate?    |

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
Well, let us add these properly contextualized to the article.    |

<user_id=Slrubenstein>
No, I never deleteed this from the article, I have simply put it in its place,  This is not an articles about inbreeding and its consequences, which is all Mirardre seems to obess on.  This is not even an article on incest, which can involve inbreeding but often times does not, but anyway is the objct of another article,  This is an article on ""the incest taboo"" which is social fact found in many societies but not all.  The United States and the UK arguably od not have an incest taboo.  Instead, it is regulated by the state through laws, which are not the same things as taboos.  You seem to be demanding to turn the article into what it is not.    |

<user_id=Miradre>
Since the secondary sources Maunus have kindly presented have established that if anyone should be mentioned it is Morgan, I hope we can remove the material about Maine from the article. Sure, how wide the incest taboo applies varies culturally but there is a view that there is hard biological core that is not only due to culture but is genetically programmed. This view should be presented fairly including the evidence supporting this. Besides what I have already mentioned it also includes the presence of incest avoidance in many animals including our closest primate relatives. '' Miradre''  E-mail)

<user_id=Maunus>
I now have a copy of Wolf and Durham's ""Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo the state of knowledge at the turn of the century"". This book basically presents the bio-centric viewpoint and presents rather strong arguments in favor of seeing the Westermarck effect as a real and evolved mechanism for incest avoidance. Its main doubt however is still the question of whether this means that the Incest Taboo has a biological underpinning - one author (Durham, the odd one out in this context, but probably more representative of the cultural anthropological viewpoint) argues that the reality of the Westermarck effect in fact undermines the argument that the taboo is biological, because in the cases where the effect have been shown (kibbutz children, taiwanese and lebanese adopted brides) there has actually been a rule dictating marriage between children that have grown up together - i.e. the effect did not result in any cultural tendency to condemn such unions. That is, there is no evidence from the jump from biological mechanism to cultural rule.·

<user_id=Miradre>
That is an interesting view that should be presented in the article. '' Miradre''  E-mail)

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Factual Accuracy: The discussion revolves around the accuracy of claims made in an article, specifically regarding who first proposed a theory and whether the claim is supported by the primary source or requires secondary sources. Both parties, Miradre and Slrubenstein, provide quotes and references to support their positions. Miradre points out that primary sources are not suitable for establishing who was the first to propose a theory, which is a valid point in academic writing and Wikipedia's guidelines.

2. Relevance: The arguments presented are relevant to the topic at hand. The discussion is focused on the historical context of the incest taboo and the biological explanations for it. Both parties are trying to ensure that the article reflects accurate historical information.

3. Coherence: The discussion is coherent, with each participant responding to the points raised by the others. There is a clear thread of conversation, with references to specific pages and quotes from the sources in question.

4. Use of Sources: Both participants discuss the use of primary and secondary sources. Maunus intervenes with additional secondary sources, which adds depth to the discussion. The use of secondary sources is crucial for verifying claims about historical precedence and the context of scientific theories.

5. Civility: While there is a hint of frustration in the tone of some messages, especially from Slrubenstein, the overall discussion remains civil and focused on the content rather than personal attacks.

6. Willingness to Improve the Article: Both parties express a willingness to improve the article, with Slrubenstein promising to add a secondary source and Miradre agreeing that interesting views should be presented in the article.

Overall, the discussion shows a commitment to factual accuracy, proper sourcing, and improving the quality of the article. The participants are engaged in a substantive debate about the content, which is a positive aspect of the discussion quality.

"<user_id=WarKosign>
Out of the 3 sources, one says ""settlers were imbued with the idea of returning to the old-new land, to a specific national territorial goal"" and the second says ""that Jews had a deep and vital historical connection to the land was essential to asserting the right to resettle in it"" - nothing about Jews originating in the land, only about returning (presumably after being expelled). Do you have a source that supports your new statement about Jews originating in the Land of Israel ?

<user_id=No More Mr Nice Guy>
That sentence is describing what Zionists think, so it doesn't matter if it's a myth or not (and it's much less of a myth than you'd like it to be, but that's neither here nor there). You don't get to push your POV on other people's thoughts.

<user_id=Benjil>
I am very happy that ""you know"" that the expulsion of Jews from Judea was a myth, but your personal opinion, unrelated to the facts, is of no interest to us.

<user_id=WarKosign>
Please don't tell me what I know. Or maybe it was a royal we ? Your personal opinions are irrelevant. Here we go by sources, and while you may not like it, the sources say that the Zionists were motivated by the Jewish diaspora.

<user_id=Benjil>
I don't even understand the logic of your question. This is a false dichotomy. There is no contradiction between the fact that the jews originated from there and wanted to return to it after having been expelled/exterminated/ and forced to leave by the Romans.

<user_id=Dailycare>
I'm also OK with saying ""motivated by the diaspora"", although that seems less faithful to the cited sources than ""originating"" or ""left"". Concerning the myth of exile, it is not my personal opinion but the consensus opinion of serious historical scholarship in the matter: ♥No Return, No Refuge (Howard Adelman, Elazar Barkan, p. 159): ""in the popular imagination of Jewish history, in contrast to the accounts of historians or official agencies, there is a widespread notion that the Jews from Judea were expelled in antiquity after the destruction of the temple and the ""Great Rebellion"" (70 and 135 CE, respectively). Even more misleading, there is the widespread, popular belief that this expulsion created the diaspora."" ♥Although the myth of an exile from the Jewish homeland (Palestine) does exist in popular Israeli culture, it is negligible in serious Jewish historical discussions.(Israel Bartal, dean of humanities at the Hebrew University)

<user_id=WarKosign>
In the popular imagination of Jewish history ... there is a widespread notion that the Jews from Judea were expelled in antiquity. This source supports the current statement in the lead perfectly, regardless of correctness of this notion.

<user_id=Benjil>
If you are speaking about the idea that the Diaspora started at the time of the destruction of the Temple, of course this is a myth, and a Christian one, not a Jewish one (Jews were perfectly aware of this fact). Many Jews, probably the majority, already lived in Diaspora at the time. Regarding the Jews that did live in Judea at the time, many were slaughtered during the wars with Rome, in fact, most of them as Cassius Dio wrote after the Bar Kokhva revolt and as shown by archeology and other testimonies. Many were taken as slaves (around 100,000 according to Josephus) during the first war; Many of the remaining Jews left after, because of the ongoing persecutions, special taxes, land grabbing etc...

<user_id=Dailycare>
WarKosign, that source doesn't discuss ""advocates of Zionism"" or ""national liberation movement"" at all, so no, the source doesn't support the statement.

<user_id=Dailycare>
We know that the expulsion of Jews from Palestine is a myth.

<user_id=No More Mr Nice Guy>
You can put as much filler as you like in there, UNDUE is not about size.

<user_id=Makeandtoss>
Now you are referring to fringe theories. As I said for the '''millionth''' time, we are '''not''' saying that this was/is Zionism, we are saying that this was a PART of Zionism in its '''earliest''' stages.

<user_id=No More Mr Nice Guy>
Yesterday you said that ""Zionism once strove towards the establishment of a Jewish state outside of Palestine"", but today you're ''not'' saying that ""this was/is Zionism""? Cool. Anyhow, I didn't say anything about fringe theories, just noted that UNDUE is not about size. By the way, I don't have access to ""Schreiber, Mordecai. ''The Shengold Jewish Encyclopedia'', 2003. Page 291"". Could you please post some of the text there so we can see there's no COPYVIO?

<user_id=Makeandtoss>
Yes I did say that, I wanted to say part of Zionism. WP:UNDUE says ""Giving due weight and avoiding giving undue weight mean that articles should not give minority views or aspects as much of or as detailed a description as more widely held views or widely supported aspects"" Does the 295 to 177 votes in the Uganda Scheme look like a minority view to you?!? I copied that text from a Wikipedia article, I just tried to paraphrase it, just in case...

<user_id=No More Mr Nice Guy>
So you've never actually laid eyes on the source you put in the article, and are paraphrasing ""just in case""? That's awesome. Please read WP:SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT. You also obviously don't understand what ""minority views"" means.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The discussion revolves around the historical interpretation of the Jewish diaspora and the origins of Zionism. The participants are debating the validity of the claim that Jews were expelled from Judea and whether this expulsion is a myth or historical fact.

2. User WarKosign and User Dailycare present sources to support their claims that the notion of Jews being expelled from Judea and creating the diaspora is a myth, at least in the context of popular belief versus historical scholarship.

3. User Benjil counters by discussing the historical context of Jews living in the diaspora before the destruction of the Temple and the subsequent events that led to the dispersal of Jews from Judea, such as wars, slavery, and persecution.

4. User No More Mr Nice Guy and User Makeandtoss are discussing the relevance and weight of certain views within the article, specifically the Uganda Scheme as part of early Zionism, and the proper use of sources.

5. The participants are using a mix of historical sources, interpretations, and Wikipedia policies to argue their points. There is a clear effort to adhere to Wikipedia's standards for verifiability and due weight, although there is some disagreement on the interpretation of these policies.

6. The discussion includes some elements of personal opinion and interpretation, which is natural in a debate about historical events. However, the participants are generally attempting to back up their claims with sources.

7. There is a concern raised about potential copyright violation (COPYVIO) and the proper attribution of sources, which is important for maintaining the integrity of the article.

Overall, the discussion shows a reasonable level of engagement with the subject matter and an attempt to reconcile different viewpoints with the available historical evidence and Wikipedia's content policies. The participants are actively debating and providing sources, which is a positive aspect of the discussion. However, there are moments where the discussion veers into personal opinion and interpretation without clear consensus, which can detract from the quality of the argumentation.

Date of Death not confirmed

<user_id=Rockypedia>
So far, there's only one place that lists the date of death as December 22 - the NY Daily News.  Two problems with this: the article says ""died December 22 in Bethlehem, Pa., Stern announced in a statement on Tuesday."" - when Stern did not, in fact, announce an exact date; there's no date on the Stern page that the NYDN article links to, either.  Second, that date may well have been pulled from this wikipedia page - it was added, unsourced, by an anon IP at 01:20, 6 January 2016

<user_id=Rockypedia>
Legacy.com appears to be just an aggregator that pulls dates of death from other news articles. It's not independent and likely pulled their info from the NY Daily News article, and the date in that article is suspect, as discussed above.

<user_id=Rusted AutoParts>
That's your own original research and just plain guesswork. Legacy is a site that takes in numerous obituaries and prides itself in providing accurate information. Is it not possible this IP that worries you added it upon seeing the Legacy or New York Daily News obit and simply didn't link the source? All that is at this point is assuming and guesswork. Unless you have any valid, sourced reasons to counter, I'm going to link the Legacy article to the page and correctly move Martin's back to the Deaths in December 2015 page.

<user_id=Rockypedia>
Legacy is a site that takes in numerous obituaries and prides itself in providing accurate information. - that sounds like your own original research and just plain guesswork. The anon IP that added the date to this page added it 21 hours before the Daily News article appeared, so no, it's not possible. The Legacy entry is not dated or time-stamped, but the first comments there appeared on Jan.6 as well, and since the Wikipedia edit was made on Jan. 5 (local US time), then no, that wasn't after seeing the Legacy entry either. The burden of proof is on you to provide proof that you know Dec. 22 was the date of death, not the other way around.

<user_id=Rusted AutoParts>
Nope, it's still on you. Your assuming that Legacy isn't reliable is YOUR own guesswork. We can keep slinging accusations of who's guessing on what, but burden of proof is on you to prove December 22 isn't correct. We can't go by ""IP added it this time, followed by NYDN 21 hours later"". That's assuming that paper read Wikipedia and saw the date. And thus you add onto the assumptions that Legacy read the Daily News after. So since we have a reliable source saying December 22, we can use that, with no strings of unreliability attached.

<user_id=Rockypedia>
You should check out Wikipedia:List_of_citogenesis_incidents. There's a good bit of evidence that that's exactly what happened here, because while many other news sources reported Martin's death, only one of them listed an actual date of death, and that reporting came long after the Wikipedia edit in question. I'm not saying he definitely didn't die on Dec. 22 - I'm saying that until it's confirmed, that should not be listed as the date of death.

<user_id=Rusted AutoParts>
...But it has been confirmed. By Legacy. Seriously, what proof do you have that Legacy or New York Daily News cited Wikipedia as being the place they found the December 22 date? We can't prove that in the 21 hours between addition and publication that NYDN looked here and grabbed the date from there. If you can prove thst, fine. If you can't then Martin should be moved to December 22, as we have a source for that.

<user_id=Rockypedia>
I don't think you can ignore the strong evidence that this is a case of circular referencing just by saying ""if you can prove that, fine"". Those other cases Wikipedia:List_of_citogenesis_incidents serve as a reminder that we should be cautious about getting it right. If the December 22 date is so definitive, why didn't more media outlets publish it? TMZ is a pretty accurate source, and they didn't publish a date. Neither did any traditional news sources, such as USA Today. This NY Daily News article says ""He passed away in early January"", and that's the same source that you claim is so reliable. I'm just saying that in this case, when Wikipedia may be used as a source for a subject that received minimal coverage, we should be very careful about perpetuating incorrect information. That's my main concern. What is your main concern?

<user_id=Rusted AutoParts>
My concern is you assuming it's a case of Wikipedia sourcing itself. My concern is you labelling sources like Legacy, a site which it's main function is publishing obituaries, unreliable. I'm asking you to give me a reason to believe it's a case like previous ones, you keep basically stating "" it's happened before"". Those we were able to prove, here we have not, except the assumption that they took their information from us. If they put ""per Wikipedia, he died December 22"", Id be in agreement, but since no cite to Wikipedia was made, we can't confirm or deny. NYDN is gossipy, so it's why I don't value it as much as I do Legacy. I again implore you to provide evidence to prove your point for this exact circumstance, rather than bring up prior cases, cases that do not offer any evidence towards this one.

<user_id=Rockypedia>
It's not an assumption; there's evidence to believe it may have happened, and in this particular case, I believe we should be cautious, as we run the risk of the circular reporting reinforcing itself, if that's what did happen. Legacy gets its info from newspapers, and the newspaper to originate that date of death was the NYDN. So if you don't trust the NYDN (I don't, especially given their other page that said Martin died in January) then you can't trust Legacy ''in this case''.

<user_id=Rusted AutoParts>
there's evidence to believe it '''may''' have happened - Rockypedia					False
2	2016-04-25 19:37:03	Rusted AutoParts	That's an assumption right there. So I ask again, please provide '''evidence''' that they read Wikipedia and got the date from there. 					False

1	2016-04-25 19:40:02	Rockypedia	Hang on now. Did you just switch from saying NYDN is gossipy, so it's why I don't value it"" to ""NYDN is my reliable source because I just realized Legacy got their info from them""? It's okay to admit you may have been slightly mistaken about Legacy.com, you know. No one is going to admonish you for that.

<user_id=Rockypedia>
Also, if you're going to use NYDN as your reliable source, which article are you going to use? The one that says he died on Dec 22, or the one that says he died in ""early january""?

<user_id=Rusted AutoParts>
Where's your evidence that I made that statement?

<user_id=Rusted AutoParts>
Where's your evidence Legacy took it's information from NYDN?

<user_id=Rusted AutoParts>
And finally, again, where's your evidence both those sites visited Wikipedia and got the date here? Answer a fucking question. Please.

<user_id=Rockypedia>
Please don't get abusive. Despite the profanity, I will answer your questions with information that I've already provided above.

<user_id=Rockypedia>
You said ""please provide '''evidence''' that they read Wikipedia and got the date from there."" - you didn't specify who ""they"" was, Legacy or NYDN. I took it to mean NYDN. Please be specific.

<user_id=Rockypedia>
Legacy takes its info from newspapers, as is evidenced in the link I provided. The only newspaper to publish a date of death was the NYDN.

<user_id=Rockypedia>
I'm not saying Legacy visited Wikipedia. I'm saying they got their info from NYDN. Their own website says they take info from newspapers, and NYDN is the only newspaper to publish a date of death. So please advise, are you now saying NYDN is a reliable source?

<user_id=Rusted AutoParts>
No, i'm not, and once again, you're assuming. So now you must provide evidence Legacy got their info from the NYDN. What if they weren't the only ones to publish a date? You can't skate by assuming everything. I'm feeling like you're just wasting my time now.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Rockypedia's Argument:
   - Rockypedia raises concerns about the accuracy of the date of death reported by the NY Daily News and questions the reliability of Legacy.com as a source, suggesting it may have aggregated its information from the NYDN article.
   - Rockypedia points out the possibility of circular referencing, where Wikipedia might have been used as a source by the NYDN, which in turn could have been used to update Wikipedia, leading to a feedback loop of unverified information.
   - Rockypedia references Wikipedia's list of citogenesis incidents to support the argument that such circular referencing has occurred before and should be guarded against.
   - Rockypedia's argument is cautious and seeks to avoid the propagation of potentially incorrect information without further confirmation.

2. Rusted AutoParts' Argument:
   - Rusted AutoParts defends the reliability of Legacy.com and insists that the burden of proof is on Rockypedia to disprove the December 22 date.
   - Rusted AutoParts dismisses Rockypedia's concerns about circular referencing as mere assumptions and demands direct evidence that the NYDN and Legacy.com sourced their information from Wikipedia.
   - Rusted AutoParts' argument is based on the assumption that Legacy.com is inherently reliable and that, in the absence of direct evidence of circular referencing, the date should be accepted as correct.

Evaluation of Argument Quality:
- Rockypedia's argument is based on a cautious approach to ensure the accuracy of information, recognizing the potential for circular referencing and the propagation of incorrect information. The argument is supported by references to similar past incidents and a logical analysis of the timeline of events.
- Rusted AutoParts' argument is more assertive in accepting the date of death as reported by Legacy.com and the NYDN, but it lacks a critical examination of the sources' reliability in this specific case. The argument dismisses concerns about circular referencing without adequately addressing the possibility that it could have occurred.

Overall, Rockypedia's argument is more cautious and thorough in its approach to verifying information, while Rusted AutoParts' argument is more assertive but less critical of the sources in question. Both parties could benefit from seeking additional independent verification of the date of death to resolve the dispute.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

About the revert of my 1 Feb 2016 correction

<user_id=209.179.86.123>
Hello, , could you please explain why you reverted my edit? You wrote, ""Let's not provide readers with bad translations,"" and I went back and double checked what I wrote, and I was correct as far as I can see. If I misunderstood something, could you please explain what it is? Thanks. __

<user_id=Rklawton>
You mistranslated the german ranks. Furthermore, with linked ranks, it's not necessary to provide a translation.

<user_id=209.179.86.123>
I'm sorry, but you're still being vague. Could you please be specific, with something like, ""When you translated 'xxxxxx' as 'yyyyyy' it was incorrect, because of 'zzzzzz'"". That would probably clear up the confusion. Thanks. __

<user_id=Rklawton>
Just check out the article's edit history and compare revisions. Level up!

<user_id=209.179.86.123>
Oh, for Pete's sake. Are you deliberately being obstinate? Can't you answer a simple question with a simple answer? And since this may be an extended round of 20 Questions, are you in fact competent to question another person's edit on this subject? I'm beginning to think you aren't. (By the way, what does ""Level Up!"" mean?) __

<user_id=Rklawton>
I realize I'm being less helpful than you would like. However, you are putting less effort into this than I would like, so it's a wash. Go see what changed via the article's edit history, read my comments and edit summaries, and figure it out. If you aren't willing to put that much effort into this, then you should probably find something else to do with your  time.

<user_id=209.179.86.123>
Well all right then. I guess a better use of my time will be to seek Dispute Resolution since you  clearly are not willing to cooperate in a meaningful way. Is that what you want?  By the way, this is not a wash, as YOU, as the person challenging the veracity of another person's edit, are responsible for justifying YOUR action by providing an explanation of YOUR actions. (It funny you didn't know that already. Maybe you just forgot?) I honestly don't understand your behavior on this matter. __

<user_id=Rklawton>
I did explain it, and my explanation was quite clear.

<user_id=209.179.86.123>
Your ""explanation"" was anything but. It's like a math teacher who gives back to a student a math problem and simply says, ""you didn't do it right,"" without an explanation as to how or why. The way we keep going around in circles reminds me of that movie Groundhog Day, where everything seems to keep happening again and again. Say, when is Groundhog Day?  Whatever.  __

My interpretation of the revert is that the German and American/English(?) ranks added are not exactly equivalent and it is better to have the reader click the link to the German rank to understand the subtleties.  But that's just me. John (/

<user_id=209.179.86.123>
Hello, , I thought I'd try one more time to get you to explain specifically what you believe was wrong about my corrections. Thanks in advance. __

Your ""explanation"" was anything but. It's like a teacher who gives an essay back to a student and simply says, ""you put a comma in the wrong place,"" without any explanation as to where.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User 209.179.86.123 is seeking clarification on why their edit was reverted. They are asking for specific feedback on what was incorrect about their translation of German ranks.

2. User Rklawton responds by stating that the translation was incorrect and that it's unnecessary to provide a translation when ranks are linked. However, Rklawton does not provide the specific details requested by User 209.179.86.123.

3. User 209.179.86.123 continues to request specific feedback, expressing frustration at the lack of clear communication and considering dispute resolution due to the perceived uncooperative behavior of Rklawton.

4. User Rklawton maintains that they have explained the issue, but still does not provide the specific details requested by User 209.179.86.123.

5. User Jwy offers an interpretation of the situation, suggesting that the ranks may not be exactly equivalent and that it might be better for readers to click through to the linked article to understand the nuances.

6. User 209.179.86.123 repeats their request for a specific explanation and compares the situation to receiving vague feedback on an essay.

Evaluation of Discussion Quality:

- The discussion lacks constructive feedback and specific details that would help User 209.179.86.123 understand the reason behind the revert of their edit.
- User Rklawton's responses are dismissive and do not engage with the request for clarification in a helpful manner.
- User Jwy's input provides a potential rationale for the revert but does not directly address the specific concerns of User 209.179.86.123.
- The overall tone of the discussion is unproductive, with User 209.179.86.123 expressing frustration and User Rklawton not providing the requested information.

Given these points, the discussion is not of high quality. It lacks the elements of effective communication, such as clarity, specificity, and a willingness to engage constructively. The discussion does not move towards a resolution or understanding but instead remains in a state of conflict and misunderstanding.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 3.",3.0
"<user_id=Alexikoua>
Its clear that the present title is the most popular in literature compared to 'persecutions', especialy if we take into account the Pontian Genocide which is part of this article.

<user_id=Takabeg>
The term ""Genocide"" is not used for all of these atrocities and massacres. Even some scholars use the term ""Genocide"" for all of only for all of them, it is not general trend. In short, Greek genocide is not common name of entire events. We'd better create the article Pontic Greek Genocide or Pontian Greek Genocide. I'm not sure but I felt Pontic Greek Genocide or Pontian Greek Genocide can be common name of events in Pontus. Otherwise, we cannot normalize and neutralize this article. UUnfortunately, at present, we must add {{NPOV}} to this article.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
Takabeg, the fact that we should also have an article about the Pontic Genocide which is part of the Greek Genocide, is irrelevant with tagging this article as pov. Since this is the most used term in bibliography, as you proved (persecutions etc are less used), I wonder what's your argument on this.

<user_id=Takabeg>
It's impossible. Maybe it's difficult for you to understand this problem with your {{systemic bias}}. But research on Google Books proved that this article cannot be kept under this title. As you know, the Greek ethnic cleansing in Chameria, massacre of Chams, Albanian massacres of the 1943-44 in Charmeria had taken place. If these persecutions, ethnic cleansing, massacres　was explained by combining with relatively smaller persecutions by Greece gov. and/or Greek people, under the title such as Albanian massacres by Greeks (instead of “massacres of Chams”), “Albanian genocide"" (instead of Albanian genocide in Chameria; somebody call “genocide” to these events), are these article neutral or not ? As you know, '''Pontic Genocide''' is not same as other massacres in Asia Minor. Apart from contents, this title abuses WP:COMMONNAME & WP:POVTITLE.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
Actually you claim that 'Genocide' isn't widely established in literature, but your search in gbooks makes it the most popular term copared to 'Persecution' etc.. If you suggest another name or a split, feel free to make or explain your proposal.

<user_id=Ali55te>
How come Pontus is a small place ? It is the whole BLACKSEA REGION. There were more then 350.000 Greeks were living there before the genocide. Apart from there most of the remaining ones were in Costantinopole and Smyrna. Your hypothesis about this small region is not valid here.

<user_id=GGT>
I cannot understand how it can be understood that ""genocide"" is widely estanlished in reliable literature from those results and analysis. Is it just me seeing that there are about ten reliable sources calling this event ""Greek genocide""? And is it just me who thinks that this is very few for the murder of a great number of people? Or is it me who does not know what a genocide is? I think an analysis of the ""persecution"" / ""massacres"" results would be helpful. And the NPOV tag should remain on the article until we settle this dispute with third party editors who has not yet commented on this issue, I think.

<user_id=Khirurg>
No, I think this is just a case of WP:IJUSTDONTLIKEIT by Turkish editors, as with the Armenian Genocide. Because the only ones that complain about POV are Turkish editors. I have yet to see a ""third party"" editor come here and complain about the name, POV, etc...

<user_id=Takabeg>
I'm not a Turkish editor. But I understand that this article is not neutral.

<user_id=Manocihr>
Athenean is right, whole discussion is ludicrous. And Takabeg, you may not be a citizen of the Republic of Turkey, but it's clear from your username and edit history than you are a pan-Turkic nationalist of some kind - Azeri or what not. Not that such agenda-driven accounts - or even articles - are anything unusual in Wikipedia it seems...

<user_id=Takabeg>
Unfortunately, POVs of  and Manochihr are not neutral. Their approach are very biased. I think it's difficult to solve this issue for Greek and Turkish peoples. Of course, we can find some educated persons without systematic bias among both Greek and Turkish, but the number of them is very small.
Oh? And how am I biased exactly? Anyone who disagrees with you is biased? I'm not Greek, Turkish, or from a country anywhere ''even close'' to Anatolia or Europe. I'm not even from the same continent! I'm not religious, or ethno-nationalist. So pray, tell me, how is it that I am biased?

<user_id=GGT>
That is right, and I believe Takabeg's approach to this issue is neutral, at least more neutral than Athenean, who is a Greek editor, at least his/her username is related to Athens. I should add that Takabeg is often accused of being anti-Turkish, pro-Greek and pro-Kurdish by some Turkish users, see Talk:Zilan massacre for instance.

<user_id=Manocihr>
So Greek editors are biased and Turks aren't? Look, I have a degree in History, and I'm not ethnically or politically related to either side - and it's quite clear to me where the denial-of-history is coming from.

<user_id=GGT>
No, I have not said that, I just said that Takabeg is not pro-Turkish, and according to some Turks he is pro-Greek. And I accept that I am ''naturally'' biased, I believe that a Turk or a Greek cannot be completely neutral when it comes to such issues. By the way, calling someone who disagrees with you as ""denialist"" is very annoying.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
By the way I feel that Tag. needs to explain why ""Pontic Genocide is not same as other massacres in Asia Minor"", since it was geographically (Pontus is part of Asia Minor) and chronologically in the same context.

<user_id=23x2>
Hi, just wanted to share this with all of you. Ill paste a sample below for all those who could be bored to scroll through:
It is believed that in Turkey between 1913 and 1922, under the successive regimes of the Young Turks and of Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk), more than 3.5 million Armenian, Assyrian and Greek Christians were massacred in a state-organized and state-sponsored campaign of destruction and genocide, aiming at wiping out from the emerging Turkish Republic its native Christian populations. This Christian Holocaust is viewed as the precursor to the Jewish Holocaust in WWII. To this day, the Turkish government ostensibly denies having committed this genocide. Prof. Israel Charney, President of the IAGS
Turks admit that the Armenian persecution is the first step in a plan to get rid of Christians, and that Greeks would come next. ... Turkey henceforth is to be for Turks alone. Peter Balakian, The Burning Tigris, quoting the New York Times, September 14, 1915.
While the death toll in the trenches of Western Europe were close to 2 million by the summer of 1915, the extermination of innocent civilians in Turkey (the Armenians, but also Syrian and Assyrian Christians and large portions of the Greek population, especially the Greeks of Pontos, or Black Sea region) was reaching 1 million. Peter Balakian, The Burning Tigris, p. 285-286.
In an article for the August 1, 1926 edition of the Los Angeles Examiner, Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk) also affirms the slaughters. Kemal writes:""those ... left-over from the former Young Turkish Party, ... should have been made to account for the lives of millions of our Christian subjects who were ruthlessly driven en masse, from their homes and massacred ...""
Mustafa Kemal — Emile Hildebrand, ""Kemal Promises More Hangings of Political Antagonists in Turkey,"" Los Angeles Examiner, August 1, 1926 (Sunday edition, Section VI).
If members of the United Nations pass appropriate legislation such incidents such as pogroms of Czarist Russian and the massacres of Armenians and Greeks by Turkey would be punishable as genocide. ""Genocide Under the Law of Nations,"" New York Times, January 5, 1947.
Les persécutions antihelléniques poursuivies en Turquie depuis le début de la guerre européenne ne sont que la continuation du plan d'extermination de l'Hellénisme mis, depuis 1913, en pratique par les Jeunes-Turcs. Translation: ""The anti-Greek persecutions carried out in Turkey since the beginning of the European War are but the continuation of the plan of extermination of Hellenism practiced by the Young Turks, since 1913."" From the reports of diplomatic and consular officials.
... the Greeks of Anatolia are suffering the same or worse fate than did the Armenians in the massacres of the Great War. The deportation of the Greeks is not limited to the Black Sea Coast but is being carried out throughout the whole of the country governed by the Nationalists. Greek villages are deported entire, the few Turkish or Armenian inhabitants are forced to leave, and the villages are burned. The purpose is unquestionably to destroy all Greeks in that territory and to leave Turkey for the Turks. These deportations are, of course, accompanied by cruelties of every form just as was true in the case of the Armenian deportations five and six years ago. Stanley Hopkins, American employee of the Near East Relief, 16/11/1921. Regards

<user_id=GGT>
Well, I cannot find that quote in the works of Israel Charny, and there is no use of the term ""Greek genocide"" in the works by him.

<user_id=23x2>
Well, if you can not find it in Google, it doesn't mean its not there. May i suggest looking into the actual Dr. Adam Jones book ""Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction"" as the reference was taken from there.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The discussion revolves around the naming and classification of historical events involving the Greek population in the early 20th century, specifically whether the term ""Greek Genocide"" is appropriate and neutral.

2. User Alexikoua argues that ""Genocide"" is the most used term in the bibliography, suggesting it is the common name for the events.

3. User Takabeg counters that the term ""Genocide"" is not universally accepted for these events and suggests that the article title may not be neutral, proposing a more specific title like ""Pontic Greek Genocide.""

4. User Ali55te emphasizes the scale of the events in the Pontus region, arguing against the minimization of the area's significance.

5. User GGT questions the prevalence of the term ""Greek Genocide"" in reliable literature and suggests that the neutrality of the article is in question.

6. User Khirurg accuses Turkish editors of bias, similar to the situation with the Armenian Genocide, implying that nationalistic bias is influencing the discussion.

7. User Manocihr claims to have a degree in History and states that they are not ethnically or politically related to either side, suggesting that their view is neutral and informed.

8. User 23x2 provides quotes from various sources, including prominent figures and newspapers, to support the use of the term ""Genocide"" in relation to the events.

9. User GGT points out that one of the quotes provided by 23x2 cannot be found in the cited work, questioning the accuracy of the provided evidence.

10. The discussion shows a mix of argumentative strategies, including appeals to authority (citing scholars and historical figures), appeals to common usage (the term ""Genocide"" being prevalent in literature), and personal credentials (claiming expertise in history). There is also an undercurrent of nationalistic bias accusations, which may affect the objectivity of the participants.

Overall, the discussion includes some well-referenced points and attempts to address the issue from a neutral standpoint. However, there are also instances of potential bias, ad hominem attacks, and questions about the accuracy of provided evidence. The quality of the arguments varies, with some participants providing more substantive contributions than others.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Restore deleted material

<user_id=Jvpwiki>
This research is controversial, and an account of the controversy is needed to fairly represent the status of the scholarship. The fact that the criticism is focused on one source (Reason.com) was noted. Lisak's research was fairly represented, at much greater length than the controversy. The criticism is not ""undue"" since it is a valid academic controversy. Much of what was deleted was included in the original article, so deleting it makes no sense unless the idea is to protect the article's subject from criticism that is happening beyond Wikipedia. JCvP

<user_id=Roscelese>
You don't have sourcing adequate for adding all this junk. If it's a ""valid academic controversy"", academic sources will pick up on it. The idea that this article needs to be represented at the same length as Lisak's peer-reviewed body of work, in Lisak's actual biographical article, is nonsensical. You must know better than this, surely. –  ⋅  `

<user_id=Jvpwiki>
Nearly half of the material in the ""Controversy"" section was in the article prior to my additions. The total words devoted to the ""Controversy"" section are less than one-third of the total devoted to presenting the research as if it were accepted fact, and part of those words actually summarize the essence of the research and its implications in a neutral way, thus introducing the rest of the article. The sourcing is clear and is the same sourcing used in the original article prior to my additions. Further, the source cited refers to peer-reviewed work concerning the controversy, The Controversy section as written is careful to make it clear whose opinions are represented, and does not disparage the subject of the article, only reports questions as to his methods and his efforts to promote an allegedly unjustified conclusion as if it were canon (most of which was in the article before my additions). This material is part of a very active controversy throughout institutionalized academia and is very germane to the biography of this important figure in that controversy. I don't get why it should be excised; may I respectfully inquire as to whether you have some personal or academic connection to this individual (which I do not one way or the other)? No axe is being ground here unless valid questions are suppressed. JCvP   — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

<user_id=Roscelese>
Lisak just is not a controversial figure. That's why it makes sense for the controversy section to be short compared to the section on his research, which reliable sources return to again and again. Once again, if Lisak's research is so controversial in academia, you should be able to provide sources that show this. I have no relationship to the guy whatsoever, I'm just a longstanding editor who knows how core Wikipedia policies work. –  ⋅

<user_id=Jvpwiki>
I took another look and found that the word ""allegedly"" used in the original article prior to my additions seems gratuitously negative. The original sentence was ""He allegedly conducted long interviews"". It now reads ""He reported having conducted long interviews"". Hopefully this helps avoid the appearance of disparaging the subject of the article. JCvP   — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

<user_id=Jvpwiki>
You did not remove only my edits, but significant segments of the original article that raised some questions about the subject's activities, with sources cited. There are no Wikipedia policies calling for articles to be entirely positive about a subject's work, and the article as just restored is not disparaging. I suggest we refer this to a third party as provided by Wikipedia procedures. Do you agree? JCvP

<user_id=Roscelese>
No, that's incorrect. Only your new additions were reverted. If you still believe you can make a case for the inclusion material despite how poorly cited and undue it is, you should seek broader consensus, eg. through WP:RFC, WP:BLPN, or WP:3O. –  ⋅

<user_id=Jvpwiki>
No, you did remove some significant material that was in the original article. I have moved the ""Controversy"" section to follow all of the research material, making it easy to see that there is twice as much of the latter than the former. It is not my responsibility to make a case for including significant information properly cited about the subject of an article. I have not seen your case for excising significant information. Have you reviewed the Talk page for this article? It seems clear that others knowledgeable about Wikipedia ways also see a purpose to including the controversy and not leaving the impression that the subject's research is canonical.

I've explained to you repeatedly what the problem with your new edit is and what you would have to do to get that text included, and you're not interested. I suggest you work on contributing to Wikipedia in positive rather than negative ways, eg. by correcting typos and broken links, so that you can observe experienced editors and learn about policy until you're competent enough to edit controversial articles yourself. –  ⋅

<user_id=Radicleman>

<user_id=Jvpwiki>
The comments by Roscelese have degenerated into insults. The quotation is actually from the policy.

<user_id=NoahB>
Since there's been a request for consensus and other folks to weigh in...to me it appears that Roscelese is clearly in the wrong. Jvpwiki's additions should absolutely be in the article, and a discussion of the controversy around the subject's conclusions needs to be in the article. Reason is a reliable source. Roscelese needs to stop edit warring, and let the material about the controversy stand.

<user_id=Roscelese>
Jvpwiki, if you don't follow the rules and provide a neutral account of the dispute at WP:3O, there's no way that any result can be valid. I suggest again that you step away from this article until you are able to edit competently and in good faith, without violating RS or DUE and without repeatedly claiming that quotations which are not from policy are from policy. I do not believe that you are competent to file an RFC on this issue given your inability to file a valid 3O request. Would you like me to file the RFC for you? –  ⋅

<user_id=Roscelese>
Reason is the magazine of a think tank that opposes anti-rape activism. They're not exactly well positioned for us to make an exception to our reliable source policy for them. I'm sorry you were misled by Jvp's invalid 3O request, but if you're interested in continuing to work with this article, maybe you could find some reliable sources that demonstrate that a controversy about Lisak's work exists outside the minds of anti-anti-rape blogs. –  ⋅

''About your Third Opinion request:''' The request has been removed due to having been fulfilled by the Third Opinion given by , above, and may not be refiled. If that opinion is not sufficient to settle the dispute, then consider Dispute Resolution Noticeboard, Formal Mediation, or Request for Comments. I would, however, point out that a non-neutral request at 3O or at another DR venue will not ordinarily result in an invalid result. Volunteers at those venues generally do not rely on the summaries except to get the most general idea of the nature of the dispute and they will either request responses from the other editors in the dispute or read the discussion before jumping in. I would also point out that 3O's are never binding, nor do they ""count"" towards consensus: they're take-it-or-leave it opinions, much like stopping a passerby on the street to ask, ""Is it true that such-and-such has happened?"" Regards,    (3O volunteer)

Fair point about 3O not being binding the way RFC is; while Jvp blatantly ignored the rules in a way that seems to have misled NoahB, it doesn't mean that the discussion is over.

Further, this essay states, ""A long-standing guideline on Wikipedia is the WP:YESPOV guideline, and this implies that content may not simply be removed because it represents a minority view.

Assertions that consensus is needed before contentious content may be added.
Assertions that contentious material may be removed without prior discussion.
These are common misconceptions, but misconceptions nonetheless. Being cited does not render content immune from restrictions such as undue weight, especially in controversial areas, however WP:YESPOV precludes simply deleting points of view entirely."" This seems quite clear to me. JCvP

<user_id=Jvpwiki>
I was the one who suggested that we involve a third party (WP:3O) so I will initiate that. At the archived page  the following is stated: ""The onus is on the editor(s) seeking to xclude disputed content, to achieve consensus for its exclusion. Anything else would be a POV-pusher's charter. If you want text excluded, it is up to you to gain consensus to remove it, and up to you to persuade others of its insignificance and irrelevance in context.""

Here is the account of the dispute I provided at WP:3O: ""Disagreement about whether content concerning controversy related to article subject's research on sexual assault should be included in the article."" How is this not sufficiently neutral? JCvP

",1,"The discussion revolves around the inclusion of controversial material in a Wikipedia article about an individual's research. The main points of contention are the reliability of sources, the due weight of the controversy compared to the subject's body of work, and adherence to Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

User Jvpwiki argues for the inclusion of the controversial material, emphasizing the importance of representing academic controversy and noting that some of the material was already present in the article before their additions. They assert that the criticism is part of an active controversy in academia and is relevant to the subject's biography. They also attempt to address concerns about the tone of the material by making edits to soften the language used.

User Roscelese, on the other hand, challenges the inclusion of the material on the grounds of inadequate sourcing and undue weight. They argue that the subject is not a controversial figure and that the controversy section should be proportionally smaller than the section on the subject's research. They also suggest that if the controversy is significant in academia, it should be possible to provide academic sources to support its inclusion.

Throughout the discussion, Roscelese repeatedly points to Wikipedia policies such as WP:ONUS (the burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material) and WP:BRD (Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), suggesting that Jvpwiki should seek broader consensus for the inclusion of the material through mechanisms like WP:RFC (Request for Comments), WP:BLPN (Biographies of Living Persons Noticeboard), or WP:3O (Third Opinion).

User NoahB and User Ricky81682 weigh in, with NoahB supporting the inclusion of the material and Ricky81682 discussing the reliability of the source in question (Reason Magazine) at the Reliable Sources Noticeboard.

User TransporterMan, a Third Opinion volunteer, clarifies the nature of Third Opinion requests and suggests that a trip to a noticeboard like RSN before going to Dispute Resolution can help focus the dispute.

Here we go. You and your assumptions. You are assuming that i am making ""excuses"" for this Chai Vang. Glad to know how you can remain ignorant. I am truthfully speaking for the greater good of this article to make it have a neutral tone without bias. Why don't you read Wikipedia's rule or neutrality. You would benefit from it since you dont seem to understand Wikipedia rules. You can see in the talk page of this article, there are a couple of editors who also feel that this article is biased. I already have pointed to specifics of details that should be included and that this article should be rewritten to maintain a neutral point of view. For example: for the aftermath, Vang's home was burned down as a sort of retaliation and result of the shooting and signs were made to Save a Deer, Shoot a Hmong. These are important details that need to be in this article because of it's significance and impact of this case. I am not excusing murder but I am not also excusing racism/bullying either. You seem to be acknowledging racism and bullying as long as it isn't murder which means you have an agenda of keeping this a misleading biased article. I suggest again, that you need to make the appropriate changes to this article. Your biased and racist colors are starting to show.  As for Peg Lautenschlager, since her name was mentioned and part of her tactic questions were briefly mentioned in this article that had no bearing on the subject in this article, a brief history on the Attorney General is pretty relevant in this article. I bet you an apology that the majority of the community would agree that this article is biased with a blend of racism.

<user_id=WilliamThweatt>
First of all, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia which is founded on Five pillars and articles are written by consensus based on information provided in reliable mainstream sources. Undue weight is not given to less reliable sources nor to a minority of sources which offer details differing from multiple mainstream sources. Wikipedia is not a forum nor is it a place for people with obvious agendas to try to right any perceived injustice. According to the multiple reliable sources and the consensus of editors active on this article, all relevant details have been included. Please take some time to read and understand the numerous links I have provided in this response and familiarize yourself with what Wikipedia is and how it operates. Opinions (yours, mine, anybody's) are irrelevant. High quality reliable sources are all we are allowed to base articles on.
You may also benefit from reading Wikipedia:Verifiability, not truth, and especially Wikipedia's policy regarding writing about living persons, the latter of which is taken very seriously and applies to all areas of Wikipedia, even talk pages.

<user_id=Lance616168>
Are you aware of the neutral point of view rule? This article is in violation of that rule by failing to not make this article as fairly as possible with a neutral tone by not including the details that are in violation of ""undue weight."" Let me state the rules from the neutral point of view. And i quote from Wikipedia's neutral point of view rule, "" Achieving what the Wikipedia community understands as neutrality means carefully and critically analyzing a variety of reliable sources and then attempting to convey to the reader the information contained in them fairly, proportionately, and as far as possible without bias."" This article is in violation of that rule. To your statement that "" all relevant details have been included', It would seem that not all ""relevant"" details have been included in this article. It is irrelevant if the status of the source is ""mainstream or a minority"" because a fact is a fact regardless of the status of the source as long as it's truthful and reliable.  I would have to disagree with the ruling of ""undue"" weight. Details are the facts of the case. It is wrong to just cite/base and write an article with the information from a ""mainstream"" source which would mislead readers to ignorance of the ""truth.""

<user_id=WilliamThweatt>
Please stop ranting. You keep complaining the article ""isn't fair"", but you haven't pointed to any specifics. That's not how this works.  You obviously have an agenda of making excuses for this convicted murderer. Nobody is going to read your rants or pay any attention to them. If you have specific changes you would like made to the article, this is the place to bring them up along with reliable sources that support the changes you would like made. Then a discussion will be had based on context, objectivity, reliability of sources, etc.  (not on your idea of ""fairness"" or your personal crusade). Keep in mind that claims which differ from the preponderance of mainstream reliable sources would need strong, peer reviewed, very reputable sources, to even be considered. (Youtube, blogs, comment sections, personal commentaries etc. aren't reliable sources).  Also things such as, for example a prosecutor's DUI or whether or not profanity was used, has no bearing on the subject of this article and is definitely neither an exculpatory excuse for murder nor evidence to support claims of an ""unfair"" trial. So don't expect such things to make it into the article.

<user_id=WilliamThweatt>
No matter how many times you say it, doesn't make it so. There is nothing misleading in the article. A man killed people in the forest. That man was convicted of murder. End of story. Race is irrelevant. Suggest a specific change with strong relevant supporting sources (not blogs or other nonsense) or move on. This is a biographical article about a convicted murderer, not an exposition of race relations in the US. If you want to discuss racism we have appropriate articles such as Racism in the United States. In fact the Racism in the United States#Asian American subsection needs to be expanded and updated to include the experiences of Southeast Asians refugees. But race didn't cause this man to commit murder, nor did it cause him to be convicted. The fact that ""racism"" or ""racist"" things may have occurred tangential to the case is irrelevant to the scope of this biographical article.

<user_id=Lance616168>
Also I quote from the neutral rules against undue weight, ""Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources, in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in the published, reliable sources."" ALL significant viewpoints need to be fairly represented in this article which it clearly is not by the lack of details in this article concerning how the shooter was treated by the victims and the aftermath.  These are very important details that wasn't written in the article which I suggest needs to be.

<user_id=Lance616168>
Speaking of which.. I was attacked with your assumption of claims of having an ""agenda"" or to make excuses for this Chai Vang person and now with names such as race racebaiter dreaming of excuses. I suggest you to listen to yourself and learn not to personally attack me because you will be reported. But here's a response for you calling me a race baiter, take a look at the case. Race IS an issue in the case of Chai Vang. The fact that significant details were neglected just makes it bias and misleading because the readers aren't getting the correct information and that the article doesn't have a tone as fair as possible without bias from a neutral standpoint. For your information, not sure if you are aware of this but I have reported this article to the Neutral POV Noticeboard. Some have agreed that the appropiate changes needs to be made to this article. There are retrospective views that need to be included in the article in compliance with the neutral POV rule.  The documentary should be considered for an external link per WP:ELMAYBE
The overall tone is biased, so a rewrite of the article with a neutral POV can surely fix that.

<user_id=Lance616168>
No matter how many times I say it. Well then, I'll keep saying it. ""Significant"" details of the shooting was left out making this a misleading biased article. Do you not understand that? You state that race is not relevant in this case however the fact is that Chai Vang was Hmong, the victims were White and that the victims called Vang slurs. Nothing you say can change those facts. The sources I referenced, most are from the news website itself. The facts are true so why don't you do some research on some of my suggestions to see if it is or not. Since it's true and the details are MAJOR, It cannot be left out of this case because it will make this article misleading and biased. Not only that, the article is in violation of the neutral POV which is one of the pillars of Wikipedia. By your logic, since Chai Vang is a convicted murderer who killed 6 people in the woods , that is all we need to write in this article because it's "" end of story "" as stated by you. Let's REWRITE the article and all we need to write is, "" Chai Vang, convicted murderer. Kills 6 Injured 2."" Leave out the rest of the information concerning the case except Vang's background. However since this article wasn't written in that fashion, it is up to us as editors to provide the CORRECT details about the investigation, trial ect. Especially the correct SIGNIFICANT details.

<user_id=WilliamThweatt>
So? The murderer and his victims were from different ethnic backgrounds, so what? I haven't denied that, in fact, it is mentioned in the very first sentence of the article already. Racial slurs may have been used in a tense situation. So what? Nothing really unique to this case about that. Sadly, it happens every day to people of every race and yet, the offended parties manage to not kill 6 people every time it does. Racial issues just aren't a ""significant"" detail in this murder case. Suggest a specific change with strong relevant supporting sources (not blogs or other nonsense) or move on.

<user_id=Drcrazy102>
, please propose '''''specific''''' changes to the article, not generic descriptions such as ""''change to describe the culture clash''"" as that doesn't provide specific changes (see Wikipedia:Edit requests for some general info on this type of proposal).

<user_id=Drcrazy102>
Also, please read Wikipedia:Indentation for using indentation to continue a discussion. I have edited the indent formatting for the above discussion to make it clearer to new readers that this is a prolonged discussion. Cheers,

<user_id=WilliamThweatt>
Again, please stop ranting. And read No personal attacks. I will ignore this one time and choose to believe you haven't read the policy and just don't know any better. Next time you will be reported and risk being blocked (losing editing privileges). Discuss the content, not editors. Only ""notable"" subjects get Wikipedia articles. (See Wikipedia:Notability for the definition of ""notability"" used in Wikipedia's context) The subject of the article is only notable because he killed people and was convicted of murder. He isn't notable because his house caught on fire, nor is he notable because a member of the prosecution team had a DUI. He isn't notable because of racism or bullying or whatever other excuse you can dream up. Those details are irrelevant to this article. Stop trying to race bait and bring race into everything. There is nothing misleading in this article. A man killed people in the forest. That man was convicted of murder. End of story. Suggest a specific change with strong supporting sources or move on.

<user_id=Drcrazy102>
Of course you haven't denied that the murderer and the victims had different ethnicity. What you are denying is that racial issues wasn't a ""significant"" factor in this case. What's unique about this case was that the victims decided to pursue the murderer with 8 people on ATV's to confront him again with hostility and who knows what other malicious intent, call him names also saying his race, threaten to beat him and then block the murderer from leaving when he tried to walk away. That is false imprisonment, assault, harassment, hate crime and attempt of assault to do great bodily harm. Don't you agree? If you think about it from Vang's point of view, you apologized for being on their land and just want to leave without any problems, then you have 8 people who just followed you on ATVs and confronted you again with hostility, they're angry and swearing at you calling you racial slurs, one of them just said that he was going to beat you up, and then you try to walk away but another person stepped in your way and blocked you from leaving. Also taking into account that you are smaller, surrounded in the woods and who knows how far from civilization. I'd bet that majority of the people would agree that the murderer was quite threatened. Seems that a case like this doesn't happen everyday contradicting your statement that this happens everyday to people of every race. Now, back to changes for the article.
For the reaction part of the article: I suggest to be added that there is a sort of culture clash between land owners and trespassors of different ethnic backgrounds. Such as Hmongs or ethnic minorities trespassing and hostile/malicious behaviors towards trespassers for example. Another thing to add is that many in the community doesn't believe that race wasn't a factor and the Attorney General downplayed the racial angle in court but the Hmong community still felt that racism was a factor in the shooting.  Another reaction to add is that bumper stickers were made and sold in shops saying Save a Deer, Shoot a Hmong and that  Vang's home was burned down in a suspicious fire and it is speculated that it was arson because of the profane graffiti defacing Vang's home.
For the investigation section: It should be explained in the beginning of the section that after Vang apologized for being on their land and was leaving, the 8 victims pursued Vang on ATV's and confronted him again with a very heated atmosphere unlike the first confrontation. The facts after the heated second confrontation is what was in dispute that led to the shootings. "" On the stand Hesebeck admitted Robert Crotteau had called Vang a 'Hmong ahole."" It should be added following that sentence that, Lauren Hesebeck shortly after the shooting told investigators that Robert Crotteau had threatened Vang that he was going to give Vang a beating, called Vang derogatory names tagged with Hmong, and Joey Crotteau stepped in Vang's way blocking Vang from trying to walk away.

<user_id=Lance616168>
I made some changes. Please review if appropriate

<user_id=WilliamThweatt>
None of the sources even come close to backing up what you're trying to claim happened. None of the sources you give say anything about ""a chase"". The supposed ""threat"" was ""I said, 'No, he said, you keep it up I'm going to kick your ass. '''Better yet, just get out of here''',"" Hesebeck testified. (emphasis added). In other words ""if you don't leave, I'm going to kick your ass...so just leave"", no implication of immediately impending physical violence at all. Also, directly from your own source: ""Joey '''may''' have stepped '''somewhat''' in the way when Vang was trying to leave, '''but that there was plenty of room in a clearing there for Vang to go around'''."" (emphasis added). That statement was all predicated on the word ""may"" and even if it were true, there was still plenty of room for him to leave. This is an opinion piece, not a reliable source, I won't even read that. this and this have nothing to do with the subject of this article or his crimes. Bumper stickers sold by one small store ''after the fact'' have no bearing on the case, which was shooting people in the back and getting convicted of murder for it. A house the convicted murderer used to own burned down, the source doesn't even say it was arson...again not relevant to the case at all. You need to do a much better job of reading and analyzing the entirety of each source before bringing them here. The very sources you provide make the case for the ''exact opposite'' of what you are saying.

<user_id=Lance616168>
The sources does ""back up"" what i claimed happened. You really are ignorant of the details in this case. Are you not aware that Chai Vang was chased by the victims to be confronted again? The first time was when Vang was confronted at the deer stand. Vang was showed the directions out and Vang walked away after apologizing for being on their land. The victims stated it themselves on the stand in court. The second confrontation happened when the victims pursed Vang on ATV's and caught up to him and surrounded him. If you think that me or the VICTIMS are lying now, please look it up or watch the documentary to see the recordings of the victims Lauren Hesebeck and Terry Willers saying it themselves.  But just in case if you don't look it up or watch the documentary, here's the proof for you.  I don't know why there's someone like you editing this article without knowledge of all the details of this case. You can even look at a small part of it in the article. This article made no mention of Vang being followed which it SHOULD have but it does say this in the shooting section. "" Upon receiving a response in the negative, he began to approach Vang and told him to leave the property. After asking for directions, Vang proceeded to walk away towards a trail through a forested area of the property. At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived on ATVs."" Seems like this article needs some serious editing to include all the information. This whole sentence should be rewritten to have a more detailed explanation that when the rest of the party arrived on ATV's, Robert Crotteau wanted to ""talk"" to Vang so they all decided to go intercept Vang. Now about Joey Crotteau blocking Vang from leaving, IT DID HAPPEN. Please look at the source above that i put for you in this paragraph.  I do agree with you that this source  is an opinion concerning the fact that it said "" There was plenty of more room for Vang to go around."" That's pretty biased. Now to your false ""claim"" that bumper stickers saying Save a Deer, Shoot a Hmong and Vang's house burning down was not relevant to the case. Sure it's not relevant that Vang shot people and is a murderer but it is RELEVANT to the reaction section in the article. By your logic since those reactions aren't relevant to Vang shooting people or him being a murderer, the rest of the article is irrelevant as well. All except for Vang shooting 8 people killing 6, injuring 2 and is a convicted murderer. It seems that you have failed to refute my ""claims"" which unfortunately for you was all TRUE. Anything else you would like to avert and refute William? } what is your opinion on this dispute? Everything i have stated was true and WilliamThweatt has just failed to refute the truth that i have stated here.

<user_id=Drcrazy102>
, I do not like to review previous edits as editors may have decided to abandon certain portions of their edits. However, I will assume you refer to the edits you made on the 6th/October at 13:27 and 13:51 (UTC)? If you edited while logged out as , I would ask that you clarify this below my comment so that the edits can also be reviewed if applicable.
Now, as for this edit on the 6th/October, the language syntax (grammar, spelling, formatting of sentences, etc.) is rather odd and poorly applied. Reviews of each change in the article: ('''''bold emphasis''' used on changes'')
First change: ""''The events after the confrontation are disputed.  A violent altercation broke out and four of the eight victims were shot in the back, and three of these four were hit by multiple rounds.''"" is changed to ""''The '''second confrontation events are open to speculation and was''' disputed. '''Opposite from the first,''' a violent altercation broke out and four of the eight victims were shot in the back, and three of these four were hit by multiple rounds.''"" This is a more confusing structure and poorly worded. I would highly recommend using a text-editor such as Microsoft Word, or similar applications, before saving your edits if you are unsure about the wording in any way.
Second change: ""''Hesebeck also admitted that he told law enforcement that Robert Crotteau had problems with trespassers in the past, specifically citing Hmong hunters, who often travel to Wisconsin from Minnesota to hunt. The term ""Mud Duck"" is often used in Western Wisconsin to refer to Minnesota residents, similar to ""Cheesehead"" being used to describe Wisconsin residents. Willers used this term to describe Chai Vang when he radioed back to the cabin. The term has no racial connotation, although the defense claimed it did. While it is unknown how Willers and the others knew that Vang was from Minnesota, the state is well known for having the largest population of Hmong in the United States.''"" is changed to ""''Hesebeck admitted that he told law enforcement that Robert Crotteau had problems with trespassers in the past, specifically citing Hmong hunters. '''{paragraph break} Days after the shooting, Hesebeck told investigators that Robert Crotteau had called Vang deragotary  names tagged with Hmong along with threats that he was going to administer Vang a beating. Hesebeck also told investigators that Robert Crotteau's son Joey stepped in Vang's way blocking Vang from leaving.'''''"" You have removed related and notable information (the line: ""''specifically citing Hmong hunters, '''who often travel to Wisconsin from Minnesota to hunt.'''''"") though the rest of the original paragraph is debatable for notability reasons. However, your ""new paragraph"" added unsourced (read: ""unverified"") information. Who said Heseback said these things? You should have provided sources for something controversial like this.
Third change: {added paragraph} ""''Peg Lautenschlager the prosecuting attorney found interest in Vang's case. Lautenschlager wanted to "" personally "" prosecute Vang. Prior to her involvement in the case, In February 2004, Lautenschlager pleaded guilty and was found guilty of drunk driving with a blood alcohol content over 50% over the limit.''"" Similar to the first review, this has poor syntax specifically grammar usage, as well as notability issues. ''Why'' is Lautenshlager's DUI relevant? ''Why'' is it relevant that she wanted to ""''personally prosecute''"" Vang? There are some ''minor'' grammar problems here but they are simply copy-edit changes and nothing substantial.
Fourth change: ""'''Did Mr. Crotteau deserve to die?' Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager asked.''"" → ""'''Did Mr. Crotteau deserve to die?' Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager asked '''rhetorically'''.''"" Do I even need to say why this is not a constructive edit? Well, I'll do it anyway: ''Editors of Wikipedia'' cannot make judgement calls on whether something was said rhetorically, sarcastically, dead-pan or humorously WITHOUT RELIABLE SOURCES CLAIMING IT AS SUCH. Otherwise such edits are considered either WP:OR or WP:POV-based and removed.
Fifth change: ""''Vang's lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were possibly due to the language barrier.''"" → ""'' Vang's lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were '''because of''' the language barrier.''"" This is the same as the above; use Reliable Sources, or it's considered POV/OR and removed.
Sixth change: ""''... and two charges of attempted homicide by a jury of eight women and four men.''"" → ""''and two charges of attempted homicide by an '''all white''' jury of eight women and four men.''"" Same as the Fourth and Fifth. If controversial, provide sources.
Seventh change: {added} ""'''''Othe'''''"": Simple case of ""WTH is this doing?""

<user_id=Drcrazy102>
I have reviewed your logged edits and find them baffling and poorly worded in some cases, and lacking sources in others. This is not an attack, this is my personal observation. Moving forward from here, I would suggest any changes you wish to make, should use the format of ""I want to change this sentence (currently xxxxx) to this version (proposed xx'''yyyyy'''). This is based on (reason) and source (cite source). Please discuss."" I would also ask that other users involved in this dispute do the same until things have calmed down again. This makes it so much easier to discuss changing content that is contentious, and results in far less edit-wars and reverted article changes. Cheers,

<user_id=Drcrazy102>
My take on this dispute is that both you and  need a refresher course on the '''Comment on content, not contributors''' idea. I will comment further after reading the sources. Cheers,

<user_id=Lance616168>
I do admit those previous edits were poorly done. I did it in a haste. However with a bit of time invested and effort put into it, the results would be appropriate for all readers. I'll make a new discussion on the changes i wish to make with the format you provided me. Please review the new post i'll make on the changes i would like to make

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Understanding of Wikipedia Policies**: Both parties demonstrate some understanding of Wikipedia's policies, such as the neutral point of view (NPOV), verifiability, and no original research. However, the application of these policies to the specific content dispute is uneven. Lance616168 emphasizes the importance of neutrality and the inclusion of all significant viewpoints, while WilliamThweatt focuses on the reliability of sources and the notability of the content.

2. **Use of Sources**: WilliamThweatt insists on the use of high-quality, reliable sources and argues that the proposed changes lack strong, reputable sources. Lance616168, on the other hand, believes that the details they want to include are supported by the sources they have provided. However, there is a disagreement on the interpretation of these sources and their relevance to the article.

3. **Relevance of Information**: The discussion revolves around whether certain details are relevant to the article's subject. Lance616168 argues that the racial context and aftermath of the event are significant and should be included. WilliamThweatt contends that these details are not directly relevant to the biographical nature of the article and that the focus should remain on the murder case itself.

4. **Tone and Civility**: The discussion becomes heated, with accusations of bias and ignorance. Personal attacks are mentioned, and there is a warning about adhering to Wikipedia's ""No personal attacks"" policy. This detracts from the overall quality of the discussion.

5. **Clarity and Constructiveness**: Drcrazy102 steps in to provide guidance on how to propose changes more effectively, emphasizing the need for clear, well-sourced, and specific suggestions. This contributes positively to the discussion by attempting to steer it back to a more constructive and focused dialogue.

6. **Consensus Building**: There is a lack of consensus-building in the discussion. The back-and-forth nature of the dialogue, with each party standing firm on their positions, does not lead to a resolution or a compromise.

Overall, the discussion shows some understanding of Wikipedia's policies and the importance of reliable sourcing. However, the argument quality is diminished by the confrontational tone, the lack of consensus-building, and the disagreement on the relevance of certain details to the article. The intervention by Drcrazy102 to provide structure and encourage a more constructive approach is a positive aspect of the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 4.5",4.5

Photo of gun

<user_id=Ianmacm>
Re this edit:  is currently engaged in a spree of adding photos of guns lifted from Commons to articles about mass shootings. This isn't necessary or desirable. The guns are wikilinked, and the photos are not the actual guns used in the shooting. This gives a misleading impression. ""File photo"" is OK for lazy journalists, but Wikipedia articles should be made of sterner stuff.''''' '''''

<user_id=Tapered>
If the photos in the Commons aren't there, in part at least, to illustrate articles, what ARE they there for? Most editors don't have the time to search out and secure available photos. If you're moralizing (""lazy"") wasn't an uncalled-for personal attack, it would be amusing. The suggestion that the '''only''' suitable illustration for the type of weapon used is the actual murder weapon is ''reductio ad absurdum'': absurd by definition.

<user_id=Ianmacm>
A photo of somebody else's Carcano rifle has no relevance to the assassination of President Kennedy. Here is what the actual gun looks like. WP:PERTINENCE says ""Images should have significance and direct relevance to the topic, and not be primarily decorative. Finding good replacements is encouraged when removing poor or inappropriate images, but in some articles images may not be necessary."" This is clearly the case here, as Bushmaster XM15-E2S is wikilinked and shows what a Bushmaster looks like. None of the images in this article pretends to be the gun used in the Sandy Hook shooting, and the article should be careful about not giving this impression. I wasn't trying to say that you are a lazy journalist, but when a lazy journalist cannot find an image of something, they often go to the library and find and image of something similar. Wikipedia articles should not do this. Here is a photo of Lanza's Bushmaster, taken from the documents released by investigators. This is what the actual gun looked like; note the considerable amount of wear on the barrel. I'm not sure that this image needs to be in the article as it is non free.''''' '''''

<user_id=Tapered>
I'm glad you're not calling me a lazy journalist...because...get ready...I'm not...'''a journalist'''! I'm an editor. How is a picture of the model or type (for AR-15) of gun used not relevant? It's the essential instrument of these murderers. Your statementthat a picture of the rifle type or brand or model is irrelevantisn't backed up by any reasoning yoked to Wikipedia guidelines. You state it as an article of faith.  A photo of the actual weapon may have emotional value, but not more 'educational' value than a generic picture. Does a picture of the assassin have to show his/her actual clothes on the day of the murder?  I assume that the reason for inclusion is to show readers what the weapon looks like. That's not ""decorative,"" as per the guidelines you cited.

<user_id=Ianmacm>
Basically all that the edit did was to repeat the lead image in Bushmaster M4-type Carbine. This shows a ""straight out of the box"" gun on somebody's floor, shiny and clean and not at all like the actual gun used in the shooting. It isn't needed in this article per WP:PERTINENCE and could wrongly give the impression that it was the gun used in the shooting, as it had been positioned in the ""Shooting"" section. San Ysidro McDonald's massacre doesn't have an image captioned ""Here is what a Uzi looks like."" Wikipedia articles about mass shootings list the guns in the infobox and give wikilinks, and this is enough. Comments and thoughts from other editors on this issue are welcome.''''' '''''

<user_id=Tapered>
Have chosen to wait a few days, will re-revert.

<user_id=Tapered>
First: your reversion has been reverted, with an explanation. Re: above You use words, but create strawmen (ex:""must be picture actual murder weapon, instead of useful photo for readers unfamiliar with firearms), and don't logically refute the arguments by tying them to Wikipedia guidelines. You mention pertinence, but don't explain why it isn't pertinent. Again, you write as if your assertion must be an article of faith. And thanks for the tip, I'll fix the San Ysidro article one of these days.

<user_id=Tapered>
Here's a pertinence explanantion, with some attempt at humor.
On the day of the massacre, his haircut was 3 weeks overdue, he hadn't shaved or showered for 2 days, and according to Mistuh Blackwell, his lime green shirt and khaki pants were horribly mismatched. This is grotesquely and obviously non-pertinent.
He had not taken his anti-psychosis meds for 3 days before the massacre. This is ''very'' pertinent, but a picture of the meds would be of minimal pertinence. They are not a direct part of the massacre.

<user_id=Tapered>
The firearm used is a ''direct'' part of the massacre, and as such an illustration/photo/image is useful. It does '''NOT''' have to be the actual weapon used to familiarize a reader with firearms, or help readers unfamiliar with firearms to distinguish between a Blunderbuss, a cap and ball revolver, or a modern semi-auto rifle or handgun. Or even between internal and external magazines, which I find isn't covered by Wikipedia's Rifle article. (More work to do.)

<user_id=Ianmacm>
Given the amount of nonsense that has been written on the Internet about Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theories, it is not a good idea to show a photo that is not the actual gun. The photo of the actual gun was released as part of an appendix to the November 2013 final report, and is presumably copyrighted. Even if it was possible to cobble together a fair use rationale for the actual gun photo, adding it to the article would not add significantly to a reader's understanding. Does Port Arthur massacre (Australia) have a generic photograph of the guns used? No. Does Hungerford massacre have a photograph of the guns used? No. And so on. Wikipedia articles about mass shootings do not include photographs which are captioned ""Here is a photo of the gun that I found on Commons. It isn't the actual gun, but it looks nice anyway."" This has no value for the reader, who is quite capable of following the wikilink to the article about the gun.''''' '''''

A better option is to give a link to the actual crime scene photos which are in the November 2013 appendix. This contains a wide range of documents and photographs from the investigation. The photographs start on page 168. The Glock, Bushmaster and Sig Sauer are on pages 174 - 176. The Saiga-12 shotgun is on page 178. The Savage .22 rifle used to kill Nancy Lanza is on pages 211 - 212. These images are of more value because they are the actual crime scene photos, not random images lifted from Commons. There are also photos of the school and 36 Yogananda Street.''''' '''''

<user_id=Masem>
Unless details specific to the guns used in the crime are noted (which it does not sound like there were any) it would be inappropriate to use non-free in place of free substitutes per WP:NFCC#1. That said, I also don't think that the free gun images are really that helpful here, potentially glorifying the weapons used. Linking the weapons to their wikipages is just fine, but the images of the weapons do not really help here to understand the crime at large.

<user_id=Ianmacm>
The notable thing about the photograph of the actual Bushmaster used in the shooting is the amount of white powdery material on the barrel. Lanza fired 154 shots from the Bushmaster in the space of around five minutes, and the barrel of the gun was anything but clean. This may be due to gunpowder residue, but I am not an expert. It is a fair point that Wikipedia articles should not be gun porn and be accused of glorifying guns. Any photo of a gun should comply strictly with WP:PERTINENCE and not be used for decorative purposes. Even if the appendix photos of the actual guns were free of copyright, I don't think that anything of great value would be obtained by adding them to the article. The appendix is useful because it gives the photos in the context of the crime scene.''''' '''''

<user_id=Tapered>
@Masem. An image makes a key component of the crime ""real"" to reader. Connecting an image to a horrific crime could only glamorize it in the mind of an already disturbed, unwell person.

<user_id=Ianmacm>
You are going out on a limb here. Columbine High School massacre does not show photographs of the guns either, but there is a CCTV image in the infobox. This is in line with WP:PERTINENCE, random images from Commons are not.''''' '''''

<user_id=Tapered>
The gun photo can be labelled to make clear it's not the actual murder weapon. I'll make no concessions to conspiracy theorist types @ Wikipedia. They're already way beyond the pale. About the other articles, my reply is...not yet.

<user_id=Tapered>
You have more straw men than Mr. Green Jeans. Just because one article doesn't utilize an image doesn't imply that other similar articles ought not. You still have explained how an illustration of a murder weapon isn't pertinent, or why it's 'random.' Random would be a plate of ravioli. I've explained my rationale clearly. Please try a logical explanation to counter it.

<user_id=Ianmacm>
This is not a straw man. You have decided pretty much single handedly that Wikipedia articles about mass shootings should show photographs of the guns, then gone into WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT mode when contrary arguments are produced. Please don't add ornamental photographs of guns to mass shooting articles.''''' '''''

<user_id=Tapered>
Since the crux of your ostensible argument purports to be the policy against strictly 'ornamental/decorative' images, citing only other comparable articles, I submit for all readers the article Robert E. Lee. I'd never read this article before, but I did pick it because I guessed that it would be 'image rich.' I hit a jackpot. I further submit that the images of 1) the window at the National Cathedral, 2) the Lee Corner properties, 3) the map of Fort Monroe, 4) Arlington House/Christchurch, 5) Lee astride Traveller, 6) Arlington House '#2', 7) Lee Chapel, and 8) the CSS Robert E. Lee are all of less importance to their article than an image of the murder weapon type is to this article. A murder weapon is a necessary/vital component of a shooting. None of those images are as important to the events that give Robert E. Lee notability as the murder weapon is the the events @ Sandy Hook. Aside from the numberous images of Lee (or his monuments), the map of Fort DesMoines is by his hand, and the Battle of Gettysburg is the defining event of his career. Please refute this with a few well-reasoned sentencesthat's what I've been requesting all along.
Alternatively, in the interest of consistency, I challenge you to remove the decorative images from Robert E. Lee. I'd do it, but that would be a flagrant violation of WP:POINT. FWIW, given your criteria, the stained glass window at the National Cathedral is most egregiously decorative of the 8 violations. It's beautiful.

<user_id=Masem>
There is a vast difference between free images of works and buildings that are based on representing an influential person's life, and the weapons used by a spree murderer. It is a matter of taste and discretion. Yes, we need to identify the types of weapons determined to be involved, but it is absolutely unnecessary to show the reader those weapons to explain the tragic nature of this event.

<user_id=Ianmacm>
The way that things are done in Wikipedia articles about mass shootings is to give a wikilink to the article about the gun, and then let the reader follow it. Until  came along, everyone seemed to be happy with this arrangement. This is now getting to the WP:STICK stage, because there is no need for articles about mass shootings to repeat images that are already in the relevant articles about the gun.''''' '''''

<user_id=Tapered>
Wikipedia isn't based on taste, short of avoiding truly revolting images for shock value. Please address the salient points of my argument, or failing that, explain why the photo is ""absolutely unnecessary"" citing Wikipedia guidelines.

<user_id=Tapered>
Very often, the last refuge of someone who can't come up with a good, well-reasoned counter argument in a conflict situation is to say, ""But that's the way we've always done it!"" (A moment I while enjoy the imagined sound of the appropriate voicing!) In me, you encounter someone with '''NO''' reverence for custom for its own sake. Here, as I see it, custom needs be yoked, at least in some small way, to the Wikipedia guidelines. Next = dispute resolution. This is plainly insoluble.

<user_id=Ianmacm>
I would welcome a WP:RFC as we've started to go round in circles on this. Masem and I have tried to explain the situation but have not got very far.''''' '''''

<user_id=Masem>
Per MOS:IMAGES ""Per the Foundation, controversial images should follow the principle of 'least astonishment': we should choose images that respect the conventional expectations of readers for a given topic as much as is possible without sacrificing the quality of the article. Avoid images that contain irrelevant or extraneous elements that might seem offensive or harassing to readers."" A picture of the guns used in a mass shooting ''will'' be offensive to some, and are not required to understand the crime, so they should not be included.

<user_id=Tapered>
The example cited for this issue is a pornographic image interpolated into a medical article. This image is no way similar or analogous to ''that'' example. If you're referring to political sensitivities, may all your edits be reverted forever. That's '''censorship'''. For my part I promise to post no photos (if any are available) of the moment that bullets collide with flesh, nor any photos of Jenna Jameson toying with her ""firearms.""

<user_id=Tapered>
I'll see to it tomorrow or the next day. Promise.

<user_id=Shearonink>
Chiming in and hopeful that an RFC would be helpful.  Editorial consensus seems to possibly be against including generic photos representative of the mass killing murder weapons, an RFC would set down whatever the editorial consensus actually is and allow for outside closure (I asked a similar question at Talk:2013 Santa Monica shooting about the photo in that article of a generic AR-15 that has yet to receive any responses.)

<user_id=Masem>
That's absolutely not censorship, it's called being reasonably tasteful. We still mention the makes and models of the firearms used, linked to respective pages, and those are completely within encyclopedic information. ''But'' in terms of a violent crime, simply including images of the weapons used where their appearance does not impact the article can be considered offensive, glorifying the crime and tools used rather than the tragedy itself.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Relevance to Wikipedia Guidelines**: Both parties reference Wikipedia guidelines to support their arguments. Ianmacm cites WP:PERTINENCE to argue against the inclusion of generic gun images in mass shooting articles, suggesting that images should have direct relevance and not be primarily decorative. Tapered counters by suggesting that the images of the guns are pertinent as they are a key component of the crime and help readers unfamiliar with firearms. However, Ianmacm points out that other mass shooting articles do not include such images, which suggests a precedent for not including them.

2. **Tone and Civility**: The discussion remains civil for the most part, with both parties refraining from personal attacks. However, there are moments where the tone becomes slightly confrontational, such as when Tapered accuses Ianmacm of creating straw men arguments and when Ianmacm suggests Tapered is in ""WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT mode."" Despite this, the overall tone is focused on the issue at hand rather than personal disagreements.

3. **Use of Examples**: Both parties use examples to support their arguments. Tapered uses the Robert E. Lee article as an example of an 'image-rich' article to argue that images can be pertinent even if they are not directly related to the subject's notability. Ianmacm, on the other hand, uses examples of other mass shooting articles that do not include images of the guns to argue for consistency across Wikipedia.

4. **Appeal to Emotional Sensitivity**: Masem introduces the argument that images of guns used in mass shootings could be offensive to some readers and are not required to understand the crime, which is a valid consideration for Wikipedia's audience.

5. **Consensus and Resolution**: Both Ianmacm and Tapered agree on the potential usefulness of an RFC (Request for Comment) to resolve the dispute, which is a constructive approach to reaching a community consensus.

Overall, the discussion is robust, with both parties presenting arguments based on Wikipedia guidelines, examples, and considerations of reader sensitivity. The arguments are generally well-reasoned and relevant to the topic, although there are moments where the discussion veers towards less productive exchanges. The willingness to seek a broader community consensus through an RFC is a positive aspect of the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Contested deletion

<user_id=Samofi>
This article should not be speedy deleted as lacking sufficient context to identify its subject, because... (Its sourced term, it was regional name for a Slovak inhabited territory from a 15th century. Its also a term used by historians to describe a history of Slovak ethnic areas. Its a lot of references in article. Term is widely used in the connection with Slovak history: http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Slovak+lands%22&btnG;=Vyh%C4%BEad%C3%A1vanie+kn%C3%ADh&tbm;=bks&tbo;=1&hl;=sk#sclient=psy-ab&hl;=sk&tbo;=1&tbm;=bks&source;=hp&q;=%22Slovak+lands%22&pbx;=1&oq;=%22Slovak+lands%22&aq;=f&aqi;=&aql;=&gs;_sm=e&gs;_upl=27773l27773l0l27989l1l1l0l0l0l0l169l169l0.1l1l0&bav;=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp;=2900bb6b13d12473&biw;=1246&bih;=645 I dont see a reason for a deletion. Similiary article is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_Lands)

<user_id=CoolKoon>
So what if its sourced? Your wannabe article is completely unintelligible, has an absolutely unclear context, generally doesn't contain any meaningful information and even if it does, it's some minor detail that's already been discussed elsewhere. But let me be more specific: you started the article by stating that ''Slovak Lands'' refers to the Slovak-inhabited parts of Central Europe. Then you've inserted a highly dubious map (to say the least) with Polish labels, which depicts an alleged look of Poland from the 11th century (what the hell do Poles have to do with Slovaks?). Then you proceeded with the article by uttering this complete nonsense: ""Term Slovak Lands describes Slovak ethnic territory from the 5th century when Slavs inhabited this lands[7] until the time of Czechoslovakia[8]"". So no Czechs, no Moravians, no Poles, only Slovaks all throughout the centuries (the millennium-long Hungarian oppression, right)? Oh and then you try to support this whole historical confabulation of yours with sources that have absolutely ZERO relevance here (they either deal with the usage of term ""Slovaks' land"" in general, mentions the ""Slovak element"" to be present since the 16th century, or talks about the ""Slovak awareness movements"" from the 19th century) and call this article a well-sourced one. I'm sorry but there's just simply no way this article could be turned into a meaningful one. And quoting the Slovene Lands article for reference is a joke itself as well, because it seems to be free of the annoying myths that are ever-prevalent in the Slovak historiography (and people's minds too).

<user_id=Fakirbakir>
I agree. ""Slovak ethnic territory from the 5th century"" is an ""interesting"" and highly dubious statement. Maybe Slavic ethnic territories. I only know about Slavic tribes around 500 AD. Moreover the source does not mention this statement and the book is a simple travel book (Czech & Slovak Republics-Lonely Planet).

<user_id=Fakirbakir>
About Tótország.The old name of Slavonia was ""Tót-ország"" (Sclavonia, Thotország, Tootország, Tothorszag, Tótország).

About Totrszag - firstly it was a '''Slavic land''' in general, but later it was used for Slavonia and also for Slovak lands: ""Totsag"" or ""Tot imperium"" in corespondence of Rakoczi. But from 19th century it was term descibeing exclusively Slovak lands. Its problem of Magyar language that it made no difference between Slavs. In German, Polish, Czech and English it were normal terms Slovaks or Slovak lands. Its sourced that a term was used from 15th-16th century in connection with Slovakia and Slovaks: http://books.google.com/books?id=Gm1pAAAAMAAJ&q;=%22%C2%B4tot+vijalet%22&dq;=%22%C2%B4tot+vijalet%22&hl;=sk&ei;=4yWYToCMEYSL4gS9xZ28BA&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=2&ved;=0CDYQ6AEwAQ

<user_id=Samofi>
Slovakia and Slovaks. But this is article about Slovak lands.

<user_id=Samofi>
Its only your nationalistic point of view. Its clear nationalism from you: '''""it seems to be free of the annoying myths that are ever-prevalent in the Slovak historiography (and people's minds too).""''' Read something about personal attacks. '''Its clear ethnic motivated attack to Slovak people'''. This is about term and usage of this term. Term ""Slováky"" (it means land of slovaks, for exmaple like Rakousko-Rakousy or Uhersko-Uhry) is sourced in Czech texts in 1405. It doeas not mean that Slovaks did not call their territory Slovenská zem before 1405. In text is nothing that Slovak lands were independent or something like that. Its standard demonym in historiography used by neutral historians. Sure better than nationalistic article [Principality of Hungary], we have a 3 books which used this term but it exists, is it okay for you because its Hungarian nationalistic mythology? When was officialy used term Hungary for a Regnum Marianum? I think never, it was Regnum Marianum or Lands of the crowns of Saint Stephen. Its product of Hungarian nationalism from 19th century. Read this: http://www.ian.muehlenhaus.com/muehlenhausCollege/TermPapers/Undergrad/undergraduatethesis.pdf

<user_id=Samofi>
We know ""slovak tribes"" (). See talkpage of principality of nitra. In 5-6 century slavs in the present day Slovakia started to separate from other slavic tribes - started ethnogenesis of Slovaks, so we can talk about Slovak tribes. In 8-9 century it was specific language, only slavic language which was between east and west slavic dialects (it was not separate language but it has a own specifics). In 10th century we can talk about separate slavic language - about ethnic Slovaks. I speak about ethnicity, nationality is question from 17-18th century and realized in 19th century - for Slovaks and for Magyars too. Your problem (a both fakir and cool) is nationalism, because you connect Slovak nation with Slovak ethnicum and ethnic Magyars with Natio Hungarica (hungarian nation). I did not notice that you are able to desynonymize it. This is article about ethnic Slovak area before independant slovakia. Same like Czech lands, Slovene lands, Ukrainian lands, German lands, Polish lands. You are calling history of Budin pashalik ""Ottoman Hungary"", but it was no Hungary officialy in that time. It was just a ottoman province. Or Royal Hungary was a province of habsburg and than austrian empire - you hidden it in article ""Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867)"". Royal Hungary was mostly ethnic Slovak realm. There was only 28% of ethnic Hungarians and significant part of them were nobles. So Royal Hungary covers history of ethnic Slovaks and Natio Hungarica. But its better to create a nationalistic article  ""Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867)"" hide this fact and talking here about 1000 years continuity of the kingdom. Why it was a german and latin as official language before 1860ties? Why it was correspondence of Szapolay, Thurzo, Corvin in Slovakized czech language (biblictina)? Jan Baltazar Magin called Slovaks from Trencen county ""natio slavica"" (http://books.google.com/books?id=aHcvAAAAIAAJ&q;=%E2%80%9Enatio+Slavica%E2%80%9C&dq;=%E2%80%9Enatio+Slavica%E2%80%9C&hl;=sk&ei;=nxCcTtW1MILg4QTIx7i1BA&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=6&ved;=0CEsQ6AEwBQ) thurzo in 1606 used term ""nostra natio slavica"": ""The statement is attributed to addressed to the cities he speaks with emphasis and love about nostra natio slavica, or o naSej slovenskej ndcii.n (p. 64) Juraj Thurzo considered Slovak his mother tongue"".(). Interesting informations also here:  . So we can talk about Slovak nation from 16th century, about Slovak ethnicity from 10th century and about ethnogenesis of Slovaks from 5th century.

4. <user_id=Samofi> responds by providing additional sources and arguing for the historical use of terms like ""Tótország"" and ""Slováky."" They also accuse <user_id=CoolKoon> of nationalism and personal attacks, suggesting that the criticism is motivated by ethnic bias rather than historical accuracy.

5. <user_id=Samofi> further defends the concept of ""Slovak lands"" by discussing the ethnogenesis of Slovaks and the use of the term in historical texts. They also draw parallels with other historical regions and criticize the portrayal of Hungarian history on Wikipedia as nationalistic.

The discussion involves a mix of valid historical argumentation, source citation, and personal accusations. <user_id=Samofi> provides some sources to support their claims but also engages in ad hominem attacks by accusing others of nationalism without directly addressing the historical accuracy of their arguments. <user_id=CoolKoon> and <user_id=Fakirbakir> raise legitimate concerns about the article's content and sourcing but may not fully engage with the historical nuances presented by <user_id=Samofi>. Overall, the discussion includes some relevant historical debate but is marred by personal attacks and a lack of focus on improving the article's content collaboratively.

"<user_id=Aigest>
And the point of the article is?

<user_id=Aigest>
Practically not a single English source even for the (pompous) name and a clear WP:FORK of Serbia in the Balkan Wars. Also is way to far in WP:OR territory.

<user_id=Antidiskriminator>
You maybe did not notice the recommendation left by uninvolved editor who is also administrator. I will repeat it to you: ''""At this point, I recommend that anyone who still believes that this is a POVFORK take it to AfD.""'' Therefore I will remove tags you added into this article without presenting any source which dispute any information presented in this article.

<user_id=ZjarriRrethues>
I have mentioned in the previous section too many times that the title is your translation, which is nowhere to be found in English-language sources so could you please reply without WP:IDHT to my comment? 

<user_id=Antidiskriminator>
This was reply to Aigest's comment. If you believe that this article should be renamed, there is a procedure for that.

<user_id=ZjarriRrethues>
Are you saying that you're even going to reply to my comment about you using a translation about the subject that exists only on-wiki? 

<user_id=Antidiskriminator>
The existence of the subject of this article is supported by numerous sources I presented. I did reply to your comment. Let me paraphrase it if it was not understandable: If you think my translation is wrong and if you believe there is better translation and if you believe that this article should be renamed you are free to follow the procedure for renaming the article.

<user_id=Qwyrxian>
Only warning, Antidiskriminator: you're being tendentious and failing to actually engage in the dispute.  Rather than address the concern that your particular translation is OR, you're ignoring the issue and placing the burden unfairly on others.  If you continue to game the discussion rather than actually justifying your actions (for example, why you chose the translation you did), I will block you under the WP:ARBMAC).

<user_id=Qwyrxian>
And I should clarify my earlier comment: when I recommended taking this to AfD, I didn't mean to say that that was the only option now available to editors who disagree with the article.  I made that statement because 7 days had passed with no discussion.  If editors are willing to discuss the issue here, then they should do so.  There will not be edit warring over the tags.  I still believe that an AfD may be the appropriate choice, but it's not the only one, as it depends on the exact complaint.  ZjarriRrethues, are you suggesting that the article simply needs to be renamed, or are you, like Argeist, suggesting this is an unsavable POVFORK/OR?

<user_id=Antidiskriminator>
I thought that it was obvious that I translated the subject of the article the best I could.
The name of this administrative unit on Serbian language is Drački Okrug. There are two words. Drač and okrug. Drač is name of Durres on Serbian language. Okrug means county on english language. I think that I did not make mistake when I translated it to county because if you go to google translate it gives two alternative translations of serbian word okrug to english language: district and county. Therefore the translation of name on serbian language Drački okrug is County of Durres or District of Durres.

<user_id=Antidiskriminator>
I followed the practise of another article about administrative divisions in Serbia. Subdivisions of Nedić's Serbia. It clearly says:'' The country was divided into counties () and districts ()''. I could not use district as name because this administrative unit already had four districts (srez). Therefore I used county as name.

<user_id=ZjarriRrethues>
(unindent)The article should firstly be moved to Durrës okrug and then we can step-by-step deal with the rest. The meanings of the work okrug vary from district to department and as there's not any English-language source about it, use the term okrug as many other articles do. Btw while you're translating srez as district, Google Translate translates it as county etc. The infobox, which was added by Antid., removed by Majuru and finally reverted by Antid. when you fully protected the article uses the 2004-2010 Coat of Arms of the Republic of Serbia as the coat of arms of a ..1912 entity. Even if it resembles the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Serbia it'd still be wrong to use it. That being said the Coat of Arms was probably that of the royal family, but obviously they didn't use it as the CoA of every single province of their state. 

<user_id=Antidiskriminator>
Let us focus on the translation issue in this section.
I already explained that I did not make mistake when translating to English language and I explained what was the practice with administrative units of Serbia from that period. Will you please why do you think we should rename this article to Durres okrug?

<user_id=ZjarriRrethues>
The editors, who wrote Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia may also think that their translation ''district'' is the right one but Antid. I've been asking for English language sources that say that this entity in Durrës was called a county and instead of providing that source you're not even trying to find it. 

<user_id=Antidiskriminator>
I already explained that I did not use sources on English language, but translated the name to English language the best I could, having in mind the current practice. I don't have any source on English language for the translation of name of this administrative unit to English language. Not for the County of Durres, nor District of Durres nor Durres Okrug or any other name on English.

<user_id=ZjarriRrethues>
Don't you think that we should stick to the sources and not translate them as we see best? Many articles in wikipedia are titled X Okrug. 

<user_id=Antidiskriminator>
I don't agree. I already explained why I did use that translation and what is the current practice with administrative units of Serbia from those days.

<user_id=Qwyrxian>
Regarding the correct translation of okrug, if, in fact there is ""one"" translation, and therefore the title of this article, either a  Requested Move or an Request for comment are probably the best way to go. Things you'll want to account for are the name we use for current and historical administrative subdivisions of Serbia (see Districts of Serbia and Subdivisions of Nedić's Serbia), other information about Okrug, and our policies on WP:Article titles and verifiability.  However, ZjarriRreuthues, if you eventually plan to argue that the article should be deleted, you may simply want to ignore this and move to a deletion discussion (no reason to have a big discussion about the article title if the underlying article isn't going to survive).  Note that I have absolutely no opinion about the name, translation, or suitability of the article itself.

<user_id=Aigest>
During the Balkan wars, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Serbia conquered many Ottoman territories. In every single village occupied usually there were journal reports of crowds cheering, welcoming etc (big deal!). Up to the moment where political borders were decided by London Treaty the regions occupied were under military rule, as usual. And this situation lasted only for a couple of months, while occupying troops retreated to their respective countries. Now imagine articles for every single small region shortly and very temporarily occupied in every war. That makes nonsense since usually A. it doesn't fulfill notability issues and B. the content is usually content fork of other articles, (in this case Albania during the Balkan Wars and Serbia in the Balkan Wars) C. it leads to POV issues and disputes and we can add a D. in this case being an WP:OR. If you find any interesting info on that issue just merge it to the above mentioned articles.

<user_id=Antidiskriminator>
''A''', the article about this administrative unit fulfills the notability issues because there are numerous sources about it. '''B''', the article about this administrative unit is article about administrative unit which existed and is not fork because there are no other articles about this administrative unit '''C''' I don't agree that the article about this administrative unit necessarily lead to POV issues and disputes. '''D''' This article is not OR because every information presented in this article is supported with referenced sources.

<user_id=Aigest>
Let me see:'''A''' Wikipedia:Notability ''""Significant coverage"" means that sources address the subject directly in detail, so no original research is needed to extract the content.'' Practically every single sentence in the article points to different references varying from 1922 to 2010 magazines and newspapers and this constitutes WP:SYNTH and WP:OR. Now which peer reviewed source address the subject Durres county(?!) directly in detail? Apparently there is none. Moreover you get no google hits on that topic except wiki source. '''B''' As itself is not notable (you have no story to tell Antid) the article is clearly a fork content of Albania during the Balkan Wars and Serbia in the Balkan Wars. If you think that such generic sentences as ""the Serbian troops were welcomed"" ""they appointed local governors and ""they retreated"" deserve to be in another article separated from Albania during the Balkan Wars and Serbia in the Balkan Wars than you have no idea of what fork content is for. As for '''C''' POV issues we have 1922 Serbian newspapers variant vs International Committee investigations (see Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars) and that is just one point. '''D''' is explained above.

<user_id=Antidiskriminator>
This administrative unit existed and deserves its article. I presented numerous sources which directly mention this county which prove it existed. I already provided numerous sources and quotations and explained on this talk page that there are sources covering the subject in details. This is an article about administrative unit. There are no other articles about this administrative unit in wikipedia.

<user_id=Antidiskriminator>
Qwyrxian, will you please be so kind to explain me what should I do now in order to avoid being blocked?

<user_id=Qwyrxian>
Right now you're fine, Antidiskrimnator; I appreciate you answering the questions addressed here.  Of course, there's still disagreement.  Aigest, if you think the article should be deleted, you're going to have to nominate it for deletion on the grounds you listed. The issue is clearly contentious enough to need an WP:AfD; if you don't know how to set that up, let me know and I will assist.  If you don't wish to pursue that, and want to pursue a merge or something else, there are processes for that, too.  If you don't want to pursue those options, but just want to change the article text, perhaps an RfC is in order (if you can specifically frame what needs to be changed).  Once you indicate whether or not you want to AfD, then we can reconsider the naming issue that ZjarriRrethues raised.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Translation and Naming Dispute**: The initial argument revolves around the correct translation of the term ""okrug"" from Serbian to English. Antidiskriminator argues that they translated the term to the best of their ability, considering the administrative practices of Serbia from the period in question. ZjarriRrethues counters that without English-language sources to confirm the translation, the term should not be translated and should remain as ""okrug,"" which is consistent with other Wikipedia articles. This is a valid point, as Wikipedia guidelines prioritize verifiability and the use of reliable sources.

2. **Existence and Notability**: Aigest challenges the notability of the administrative unit, suggesting that it does not meet Wikipedia's notability guidelines and is a content fork from other articles. Antidiskriminator responds by stating that there are numerous sources that mention the administrative unit, asserting its existence and notability. This is a more complex issue, as it involves interpreting Wikipedia's notability guidelines and whether the subject has been significantly covered by reliable sources.

3. **Original Research and Synthesis**: Aigest accuses the article of being original research (OR) and synthetic, as it draws from a wide range of sources from different periods without a single source that covers the subject in detail. Antidiskriminator insists that all information in the article is supported by referenced sources. The concern raised by Aigest is significant because Wikipedia's guidelines prohibit original research and synthesis of published material that advances a position.

4. **POV and Content Fork Issues**: Aigest also raises concerns about potential POV issues and disputes, as well as the article being a content fork. Antidiskriminator disagrees, stating that the article is about a distinct administrative unit that warrants its own entry. The discussion here touches on the editorial guidelines of Wikipedia regarding neutrality and avoiding content forks.

5. **Procedural Suggestions**: Qwyrxian, likely an administrator or experienced editor, provides procedural advice, suggesting avenues such as Requested Move, Request for Comment, or Articles for Deletion (AfD) to resolve the disputes. This is helpful as it directs the editors towards established Wikipedia processes for resolving content disputes.

Overall, the discussion involves several editors presenting arguments based on Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. There is a clear effort to engage with the issues at hand, although there is also some tension and disagreement. The arguments presented by ZjarriRrethues and Aigest are generally well-founded in Wikipedia's policies, while Antidiskriminator's arguments, although less grounded in policy, show an attempt to justify their actions based on their understanding of the subject and Wikipedia practices.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Millenium187>
This article should be about European state known as Czech Republic and Bohemia alone is not the Czech Republic. In the history section there is almost no mention of Moravia nor Silesia despite the fact that previous versions were much more objective. So the section is among other things clearly a '''violation of Wikipedia policy''' of neutral point of view. And I must also admit that I am really curios whether there are some strange motives involved, maybe even of political nature but maybe I am just too distrustful.

<user_id=Iaroslavvs>
Yes, you are too mistrustful. Nobody wants to conceal history of Moravia or Silesia from readers. These lands have their respective articles here. Quite comprehensive, I think. But Bohemia was historically the biggest, richest and most powerful, central Czech land - a seat of the rulers, ""Head of the Crown"". Main events of Czech history took place right here, in Bohemia. (Cf. relations of England vs. Britain, Holland vs. Netherlands, Croatia proper vs. Croatia, Moscovia vs. Russia, Lesser Poland vs. Poland, Lithuania proper vs. Lithuania etc. etc.) Other Czech lands (especially Moravia and Opavia/Upper Silesia) were in Europe perceived through Bohemian optics and farther from Bohemia, the less people were (and are) able to distinguish between domestic differences.

<user_id=Iaroslavvs>
If you want to add some another relevant informations about Moravia, Silesia or both Lusatias, go on! But don't scream your irritated allegations here. Thanks.

<user_id=Millenium187>
Well, you surprised me a bit, really. I must admit that I expected much more tense ). Don't worry I won't scream my ""irritated allegations"" again (or at least until something make my blood boil again but that's I hope unlikely to happen ). I just wanted to state my opinion and that happened so I am satisfied. Thank you for polite and reasonable responses! But anyway, in my opinion the history section should still be expanded or generalized to ""display more respect"" to the Moravian history. I really think it should focus a little bit more on Moravia at least as a gesture of a good will and mutual respect between both nations (yes, there are two nations, officially). By the way I realize that what I wrote here might sound somewhat strange or something like that and I apologize if I offended anyone but you must understand that I am a Moravian patriot or at least I consider myself to be one. And many other people feel the same way so this (history of the Czech republic) is naturally a bit sensitive issue, not only for me but also for at least hundreds of thousands other people too. But as I said you don't need to worried about me I am usually a calm person and I won't raise such heavy accusations again unless I have really a very good reason, I promise. Is that ok with you?

<user_id=Vejvančický>
The article should provide relevant facts about the history of Moravia and Silesia, the regions are part of the Czech Republic, even though probably not ""the biggest, richest and most powerful"" ones )) Feel free to add the facts and don't forget to cite reliable sources. There's really no need to turn this debate into a battle of patriotic standpoints.   |

<user_id=Millenium187>
Thanks for your comment, it seems to me that the people here are more reasonable than I anticipated. I wrote this because I expected somewhat primitive behaviour as I know it from the Czech Wikipedia. Likely I will attempt to improve the article and extend the history section to include more relevant data concerning Moravia but fairly. And by the way Moravia once was the biggest, richest and most powerful and we cannot say it wasn't just because it isn't not now. Silesia lies in the Czech Republic only partially, it's a topic mainly related to Poland. Anyway I am still convinced that the history section still requires certain modification. Bye and thanks!

<user_id=Qertis>
While I appreciate your Moravian patriotism, you seem to be missing the point here. ""Bohemia"" is a term with at least two slightly different meanings. Due to historical reasons, namely the fact that the country was part of the Habsburg monarchy for such a long time (especially during the era of nation-forming in the 19th century) and subsequently became part of Czechoslovakia, we tend to omit the broader meaning of the term Bohemia, which is the Czech/Bohemian state as a whole, including Moravia. In short, while Moravia has never been part of Bohemia proper, it is still part of Bohemia, now called Czech Republic in English. Its fairly common phenomenon in this part of the world actually. Styria is not part of Austria proper, yet it undoubtedly is part of Austria. The same goes for Poland and its regions/lands.

<user_id=Cimmerian praetor>
Interesting thought Millenium187. For Bohemians, Moravia is supposed to be in article about Moravia and should not be here, because it is simply far too east from Prague, which is anyway the only place worth mentioning in the Bohemian/Czech Republic. For Moravians (as it seems from what you have written), Silesia is anyway far too north, and if anything, it should be part of article about Poland, because anyway nobody in Moravia understands any of the dialects spoken by the 1 million people living in Czech Silesia. Talk about chauvinism.
And since you have introduced this line of argumentation, I would like to remind you, that Silesia was for 400 years the biggest part of the Czech Crown (yes I know, only small part of it remains with the current Czech Republic).

<user_id=Millenium187>
Ok, if Moravia really is a part of Bohemia then it will be very easy to prove it so may I ask you to do so please.

<user_id=Millenium187>
Maybe you are right but a great part that ""Silesians"" still comes from Moravia and Bohemia due to the industrial revolution and the rapid growth of the cities there, not to mention that the major part of the current Czech Silesia is former Moravian territory. But I still respect the Czech Silesia I just said that it's not so important as Moravia, naturally as well as Moravia is now not so important part of the republic as Bohemia. And I think that you missing the point here, the crucial difference between Moravia and Silesia in the relation to the Czech Republic is that the entire Moravia is in CR but Silesia is mostly in Poland. What exactly are you trying to say, that I am a chauvinist or what? ) No offence, but if I am then I am obviously not the only one here, as you said: ""For Bohemians, Moravia is supposed to be in article about Moravia and should not be here, because it is simply far too east from Prague"". I agree and I take it as your confession. D

<user_id=Millenium187>
Oh yes, it was, I know, and the Great Moravia once was the most powerful empire in the Central Europe, and what does it mean now?

<user_id=Cimmerian praetor>
I don't know, you are the one who introduced this line of thought into the debate.

<user_id=Cimmerian praetor>
There is actually larger proportion of people living in Silesia, who come from Poland and Slovakia/Upper Hungary, than from Moravia/Bohemia.

<user_id=Millenium187>
The point is whether you and the others ""approve"" addition of more data focused possibly solely on Moravia into the article or not. In another words do you honestly consider me to be a shallow minded person or a chauvinist when I merely want to put a bit more emphasis of the Moravian history? Even Bohemians used to consider the Margaviate to be a ""feudum nobile"" (a noble fee), Moravia used to a rich and proud land with a high level of autonomy, the great history of being once a powerful empire, a cradle of the Slavic culture and education, can you doubt it? Am I asking really so much?

<user_id=Qertis>
So you are basically ignoring or denying the fact that Moravia was conquered by the Bohemian duke Oldrich in the early 11th century and has remained within the Bohemian state ever since. That's interesting but you are going to have a hard time finding a single reliable source supporting your point of view.

<user_id=Cimmerian praetor>
I totally agree with you. I just found it amusing that you basically have the same line of thought regarding Silesia as Bohemians do when it comes to Moravia.

<user_id=Millenium187>
I am not ignoring it. I could also say that you are simply ignoring history of the Margraviate and history of the Empire. Maybe you we should say: ""The Czech Republic, formerly known as Austria ..."", for example Mendel wasn't Bohemia, he was Austrian. In my opinion maybe you are so focused on the Bohemian history that it blinds you a bit. Please define that ""broader meaning of the term Bohemia"" and delimit when and where it way used, excluding nationalism stunts from 19. century of course.

<user_id=Qertis>
Bohemian history I am so focused on is the history of the whole Czech/Bohemian state, not just its western portion without Moravia as you seem to imply. I have no special interest in any of the regions of the country be it in the west or east. You, on the other hand, are obviously keen on the history of Moravia, which is perfectly OK to me but it should not lead you to ignore the facts. And the fact is, again, that Moravia has been for centuries part of the state which was called Duchy of Bohemia, Kingdom of Bohemia, Crown of the Kingdom of Bohemia, ... and finally the Czech Republic. ""Bohemia"" is therefore the unique label which identifies the Czech statehood throughout centuries, just like ""Poland"", ""Hungary"" or ""Austria"" identify the respective statehoods of our neighbors. See  and many others.

<user_id=Millenium187>
That's admirable that you are focused not only on Bohemia but also on the other lands of the state, and you are right I am focused almost only on Moravia but as you said there should be nothing wrong about it. Ignoring the facts, oh no, that's the last think I want to do, really. Please correct if I am wrong:
Moravia has been for centuries part of the state which was called Duchy of Bohemia, part of the Duchy, yes but only in years 1029-1182 (someone could also say to 1200) after that it was a direct fief of the Holy Roman Empire, not Bohemia, but often ruled by Bohemian Kings.
part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, I am convinced that it was never a part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, can you prove otherwise?

<user_id=Millenium187>
part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Bohemia, I am not sure what you mean but if you mean ""Lands of the Bohemian Crown"" not the crown as a jewel itself then it was since the reign of Charles IV. who declared Moravia as a fief of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown by his authority of the Holy Roman Emperor, not the Bohemian King. That happened in 1348 but in year 1349 former Moravian Margrave the Charles renounced his rule in Moravia and gave it to his brother John Henry of Luxembourg and he ruled Moravia ever after until his death in 1375, then his son Jobs of Moravia inherited his title and so continued to rule in the Moravian Margaviate (but he never was the King of Bohemia!), in 1411 he was even elected the King of the Romans and so ruled in the entire empire and before that he was for example the Elector of Brandenburg (ruler of Brandenburg). But he died the same year he was elected the King, so then Bohemian Kings ruled in the Margaviate until 1419 (so in 1411-1419) and then again in 1458-1469 (In 1464 the King of Bohemia declared Moravian Magraviate as equal to the Bohemian Kingdom, in 1469-1490 Moravians rejected the Bohemian King and elected their own Matthias Corvinus) and again in 1490-1526 (but it was Jagiellon dynasty) and then since 1526 Moravia was, together with Bohemia but not as a part of Bohemia, one of the crownlands of the Hapsburg Empire (1526–1918) but 1608-1611 Matthias of Austria ruled the estate of Moravia so not the same man as the Bohemian King (because Moravia rejected the Bohemian King again), so Moravia had again a different ruler than Bohemia. Moravia had its own diet, law, courts, constitution, territory, army, etc. independent on Bohemia until 1749 (reign of Maria Theresia, Moravia and Bohemia de facto ceased to exist) and again but this time only partially since 1790 until 1918. Then in 1918 Moravia together with Bohemia, Slovakia, etc. formed the first Czechoslovakia but it remained a separate land from Bohemia, with its own capital city, president and so on (subdued to the Czechoslovakia, not Bohemia). And as far as I know Moravia had to accept the King of Bohemia as a ruler, he couldn't just rule without the land (Moravia) accepting him. (I am sorry I wrote this in haste.) So Moravia was a long time ago a part of the Terra Bohemiae but only in 1029-1182 as well as Bohemia once was part of the Moravian Empire. And Lands of the Bohemian Crown was a confederation. But I am not a histoprian, so please correct me if I am wrong. It doesn't have to be exact, just tell me when and why exactly was Moravia a part of Bohemia. I tried to find something supporting your thesis on the internet but I didn't find anything on the contrary I found sources which claim the same as do I, like  or  but they don't have to exactly accurate, they are just someone's websites. And a book with title ""The Reformation 1520–1559"" is also just a one book, but still can you write what exactly it says concerning this issue? ) And by the way that someone conquered Moravia a millennium ago doesn't mean so much, Moravia was conquered many times before and many times after as well as many other land in Europe. But I really don't want to turn this into a irrelevant discussion. I just wan you to provide a good prove that Moravia was a part of Bohemia and delimit when exactly, until that I am sorry but must refuse to accept this and you could also define precisely that ""brother meaning"" of the term Bohemia and also support it with a reliable source'''s''' and delimit when exactly it was valid. That's all I want, thank you!

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The discussion begins with <user_id=Millenium187> expressing concern that the history section of the Czech Republic article is not adequately representing Moravia and Silesia, suggesting a violation of Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy. This user also hints at potential political motives, which introduces a subjective element to the argument.

2. <user_id=Iaroslavvs> responds by acknowledging Bohemia's historical prominence but does not dismiss the importance of Moravia or Silesia. The user invites <user_id=Millenium187> to add more information about these regions, which is a constructive approach.

3. <user_id=Vejvančický> also encourages the addition of relevant facts about Moravia and Silesia, emphasizing the need for reliable sources. This response is focused on improving the article's content and adhering to Wikipedia's standards.

4. <user_id=Millenium187> acknowledges the reasonable responses and expresses a desire to expand the history section to include more about Moravia. The user also brings up historical significance and regional pride, which are subjective but relevant to the discussion.

5. <user_id=Qertis> and <user_id=Cimmerian praetor> engage in the discussion by providing historical context and challenging some of <user_id=Millenium187>'s assertions. They bring up historical facts about the relationship between Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, which adds depth to the discussion.

6. <user_id=Millenium187> continues to argue for the inclusion of more information about Moravia, citing historical autonomy and significance. The user requests evidence to support the claim that Moravia was part of Bohemia, which is a fair request in a fact-based discussion.

7. <user_id=Qertis> and <user_id=Cimmerian praetor> provide counterarguments and historical references to support their points, which contributes to a more balanced discussion.

Overall, the discussion involves a mix of subjective opinions and historical facts. The participants are generally respectful and aim to provide evidence for their claims. There is a clear effort to adhere to Wikipedia's standards for neutrality and verifiability.

Failed verification

<user_id=Darkness Shines>
Neither source says the term originated in the UK

<user_id=TopGun>
Now self revert:
'The origins of the P-word, as its known in polite society, are far more recent than its black equivalent, which dates back to the 16th Century. Its first recorded use was in 1964, when hostility in Britain to immigration from its former colonies in the Asian sub-continent, was beginning to find a voice.''
The dictionary backs up the word's defination and the article ''very'' clearly says what you 'failed' to find.

<user_id=Darkness Shines>
Were there does it say the term originated in the UK? There is a world of difference between first recorded use and origin. And please note, it does not say first recorded use was in the UK.

<user_id=TopGun>
How much more clear does it have to be? It is clearly mentioning the origin and giving a reference to the first recorded use. A serious question, are you that naive or purposely trolling?

<user_id=Darkness Shines>
No, it does not. Please seek a third opinion or ask at the reliable sources notice board. Note, the dictionary definition does not support the edit either. Assuming you used Merriam Websters.

<user_id=TopGun>
I've given you a quotation above. You are out-rightly denying it. And good luck proving BBC non RS at RSN if you want that. You also have a very recent editwar history  on this article.

<user_id=Darkness Shines>
Were in the quote does it say the term originated in the UK?

<user_id=TopGun>
If it is so hard for you to  read from even the trimmed quote... Starting with, ""''The origins of the P-word''"" and referring to ""''Its first recorded use was in 1964, when hostility in Britain''"" and the first recorded use can directly be taken as origin as well per your pet policy of verifiability.

<user_id=Darkness Shines>
You are engaging in WP:OR Two sentences, first says ""P*ki"" is newer than ""N*gger"" that is all it says. The second says the first recorded use was in the UK. The source does not say the term originated in the UK at all.

<user_id=TopGun>
That's because you just dissected the prose. It is a single sentence in a flow and refers clearly to it and further clearly says that the first recorded use was there. And what ever way you take it, Wikipedia does not consider what is true or was the real origin in this case, it will take the first recorded use as the origin. Get it now? There's just evidence building up against you for 3 edit wars yesterday, removing citations at Taliban article after consensus was established and now wasting time here.

<user_id=AshLin>
Adding a second opinion, as per language of the BBC article, I think it means what TopGun has added. Is there another interpretation likely of the BBC prose? I think not. BTW a tip - do keep in mind at all times the need to avoid close paraphrasing. Not that it has happened here, but often attempting to avoid close paraphrasing creates a slight change in meaning.

<user_id=TopGun>
That might have been DS's aim which would still be incorrect and POV. This was just not wanting to listen.

<user_id=Darkness Shines>
You are wrong, tagged as inaccurate.

<user_id=TopGun>
'What'' dispute? The citation is now verified and tag removed by another editor as well... you are not respecting the consensus here.

<user_id=Darkness Shines>
Lol, two editors do not make a consensus.

<user_id=65.0.158.161>
The origin of a word and its first recorded use can be two separate issues. For example, read the BBC article this way: ""The origins of the F-word, as its known in polite society, are far more recent than its C-word equivalent, which dates back to the ___th Century. Its first recorded use was in ______"" Read like this, it would be understood that 'origin' and 'first recorded use' are very different, as we might have data on the first recorded use of the F-word, yet we may not know its precise origins, and the article itself does not say where/when the word originated. This Wikipedia article should reflect what the source says, which is that the first recorded use was in the UK. As it stands, the Wiki article says that the term originated in the UK, which the BBC article does not say. The M. Webster definition that I've look at also says 'first recorded use' rather than origin. To clarify how important that is, see: http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fuck which includes both an 'origin' and 'first recorded use', both being distinct from each other.
For further clarification, see how this issue is handled @ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okay and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_rarebit. Origin and first recorded use are treated as separate.

<user_id=65.0.149.160>
As I cannot edit the article myself, someone should be prepared to correct, add an addition reliable source, or remove the statement in question. Reason: Neither current sources say where the term originated; rather, both say that the first recorded use was in Britain. If there is a dispute about what the BBC article actually means, then an additional RS should be included to confirm the meaning. Otherwise, edit the article to reflect what the sources say, because as it stands, it constitutes OR. At the very least, it should be flagged as OR in a timely manner until someone can properly edit it.

<user_id=Darkness Shines>
Currently nobody can edit this article, you need to use the {{editprotect}} template to get an admin to do it.

<user_id=65.0.149.160>
Oops. Oh well. The request edit page says the protection expires in 2 days, unless I read it wrong. Will wait until then.

<user_id=TopGun>
Please form a consensus here before editing this regardless of the protection.

<user_id=65.0.149.160>
Consensus is not needed to remove OR. If you feel the BBC source does say that the term originated in Britain, then feel free to add an additional source confirming this so there can be no dispute about the meaning. The dictionary source does not say this, as that particular dictionary separates 'origin' and 'first recorded use' generally and specifically with this term. I've went through several dictionaries now, and it varies from origin unknown to plain not listing origin at all. Not a single case of 'Origin: Britain'. However, almost all the dictionaries, with few exceptions, list the first recorded use, and always in Britain. As I mentioned above, if another RS can back up the origin issue, then fine. If not, the OR must be removed.

<user_id=TopGun>
What you think is OR is disputed by two editors above, so this does not make it a simple remove the OR question. See the reasons above.

<user_id=65.0.149.160>
Again, you (or anyone else) are free to add an additional RS to confirm the meaning of the BBC article. I won't willy-nilly edit the page the moment it becomes unprotected, but within a reasonable amount of time the statement should be edited to reflect what both sources currently say, unless an additional RS (as the meaning seems to be in dispute) is added. When what a source says is disputed, it is generally good form to add an additional RS to confirm it. I am certainly open to an opposing view, but I don't see an issue with simply rewording the statement to something along the lines of ""Its first recorded use was..."" After all, you seem to suggest that 'origin' and 'first recorded use' are interchangeable, while I am saying they are not interchangeable. If you are correct, there is no harm done in editing it. Cheers. EDIT: I forgot to mention, the BBC article is an editorial, and the Wiki manual states that when an editorial is used as a source, and dispute arises about it, it is proper to add an additional source. Cheers.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The main point of contention in the discussion is whether the term in question originated in the UK or whether its first recorded use was in the UK. These are two distinct concepts, and the distinction is crucial in the context of the article being discussed.

2. User TopGun argues that the BBC source implies the origin of the term by mentioning its first recorded use in the UK. They believe that the first recorded use can be taken as the origin, which is a common interpretation in the context of verifiability on Wikipedia.

3. User Darkness Shines disagrees, pointing out that the source does not explicitly state that the term originated in the UK, only that its first recorded use was there. They argue that this does not necessarily imply the origin of the term.

4. User AshLin provides a second opinion supporting TopGun's interpretation of the BBC article, suggesting that the language of the article implies the origin of the term.

5. An anonymous user (65.0.158.161) provides a detailed explanation of the difference between ""origin"" and ""first recorded use,"" using examples from Merriam-Webster and other Wikipedia articles to support their argument. They suggest that the Wikipedia article should reflect what the source says, which is that the first recorded use was in the UK, not necessarily the origin.

6. The discussion involves references to Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, such as verifiability, original research (OR), and the need for reliable sources (RS). There is a clear effort from multiple participants to adhere to these guidelines.

7. The anonymous user (65.0.149.160) suggests a compromise by rewording the statement to reflect the ""first recorded use"" rather than ""origin"" unless an additional reliable source can confirm the origin. This is a constructive approach to resolving the dispute.

8. Throughout the discussion, there is a mix of interpretative arguments and references to Wikipedia's policies. The participants are engaged in a substantive debate about the interpretation of sources and the application of Wikipedia's content policies.

Overall, the discussion shows a good understanding of Wikipedia's content policies and a strong effort to interpret the sources accurately. However, there is a lack of consensus, and the discussion could benefit from additional reliable sources to clarify the distinction between ""origin"" and ""first recorded use."" The participants are generally respectful and focused on the content issue, which is a positive aspect of the discussion quality.

"<user_id=MjolnirPants>
Article not reflecting its sources

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
In all of the sources I have been able to check which are used to define this term (as well as a wide variety of other reliable sources not cited in the article), it is specified that no informal fallacy is committed when the authority in question is a legitimate authority on the subject in question. Yet the only place this information appears in this article is in the notes for the sources 2 and 3. Is there a good reason for this? If not, both the lead and several places throughout the article need to be edited to accurately reflect this, and I will do so shortly.

<user_id=Perfect Orange Sphere>
Look at all the examples of the appeal. They were all to what would be called legitimate authorities, but wound up being fallacious because the authorities were wrong. The appeal to authority is right when its right but wrong when its wrong, so its like circular reasoning or an ad hominem: it doesn't actually provide any evidence for the claim. Plenty of sources on the page state this, and discuss why each form of the argument listed is fallacious. Appeals to authority wind up being circular reasoning, like the page says. The issue is that while its not automatically wrong to appeal to authorities, it doesn't actually provide evidence that your claim is correct.

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
My point is that it's not an informal fallacy unless the authority appealed to is not a legitimate authority. Just because an argument is wrong doesn't make it a fallacy. There's a difference between validity and soundness. Valid arguments can be unsound, and invalid arguments may have sound conclusions.

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
Yes, ''most'' uses of ""authority X says Y, so Y must be true"" would fall under the examples given. But that's not an overwhelming majority. For instance ""Over 99% of all biologists agree that evolution is a fact, therefore evolution is almost certainly a fact,"" is not an informal fallacy. All of science and education is based upon the assumption that experts are correct more often than not, and all of the technology we have, as well as the skill gap between experts and non-experts in every possible set of skills stands as evidence that this assumption is correct. It's even logically sound to argue that learning about a subject grants more knowledge about a subject. After all, no-one attends college only to find that they're expected to teach themselves all of mathematics, history, literature, composition and the sciences through trial-and-error, with no reference material.

<user_id=FL or Atlanta>
Wouldn't most any use of it fall under one of the forms in the article? Each one has sources and a sourced example or argument for why its fallacious

<user_id=FL or Atlanta>
That falls under ""General"". Its no different from the old argument that most medical scientists believed the fevers were caused by an environmental factor, therefore it was concluded that was almost certainly a fact. The only evidence is the evidence. If the authorities believe what they do based off of evidence, then that evidence is where any authority would really be. If they don't believe what they do because of evidence, then their beliefs are not evidence based and thus carry no weight. To say otherwise has lead to circular reasoning in the past, with, as the article says, very severe consequences.

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
You're debating the definition, which isn't in question. The definition is clearly given by the sources, ''which do not match the article''. My question was why the article does not reflect its sources. If there is no reason other than the philosophical musings of Wikipedians, then it needs to change.

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
''EDIT:''' Allow me to quote the second source: ""Appealing to authority is valid when the authority is actually a legitimate (debatable) authority on the facts of the argument."" Where in the article is this even hinted at? Because I find find numerous passages in the article which directly contradict this. The examples chosen even seem to be hand-picked to refute this. That is not how WP is supposed to work. Also, check out the blatant irony of source #9.

<user_id=FL or Atlanta>
The second source was recently added, and it looks like there was a lot of contention over it. We can remove it to make the page consistent - it doesn't look particularly reliable since its just a random website about logical fallacies. Aside from that the page looks consistent to me - it cites sources for the fallacy and gives evidence and examples. The quote the article ends with really hits home why its a fallacy and what leads to it. Also, do you disagree with what I said: ""If the authorities believe what they do based off of evidence, then that evidence is where any authority would really be. If they don't believe what they do because of evidence, then their beliefs are not evidence based and thus carry no weight""? If you do disagree, why? And if you agree, then what basis is there for saying it isn't a fallacy?

<user_id=FL or Atlanta>
Also, contrary to the claim that ""All of science and education is based upon the assumption that experts are correct more often than not"", we have reliable sources like http://www.nomads.usp.br/pesquisas/design/objetos_interativos/arquivos/restrito/umpleby_science_cybernetics.pdf presented at the conference on Mutual Uses of Cybernetics and Science. Its a scholarly work on the history and philosophy of science and it notes that ""Scientific statements can be falsified, non-scientific statements cannot be.  This idea, and the previous idea of verification through resort to experiment, has had a beneficent effect on social systems.  Through the idea of experimentation, science became a means of establishing knowledge '''other than by''' coercion or '''arguments based on appeals to authority''', faith, or supernaturalism.  This idea liberated the scientific community..."". If appeals to authority were, as you're arguing, the cornerstone of science, then why do we have scholars of the philosophy of science describing going away from appeals to authority as ""beneficial"" and a ""liberation""?

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
I'm going to assume you missed the irony of appealing to an authority to refute my contention that appealing to authorities is a valid method of argument.

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
I'm removing number 9 because it has absolutely no business in this article. Also, try the following as reliable sources:
- UNC Chapel Hill Writing Center
- Stephen Downes, by way of a Stanford University handout
- Lander University Philosophy Department
Foothill College
Texas State Department of Philosophy

<user_id=FL or Atlanta>
I'll talk about the other sources in a moment, but before any changes get made, citation 9 is good - he's a historian and Medieval scholar who's published on Medieval arms and armor. He makes the point in the video of how you can't simply appeal to scholars and assume its correct - you need the actual historical evidence. Videos are valid sources as long as its a reliable source.

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
Please read WP:RS. He is not a reliable source for this article.

<user_id=FL or Atlanta>
I have read it, I’m very familiar with the guidelines. Do you disagree with any of the reasons I gave for why it’s a reliable source? Nothing said in the video is even controversial.

<user_id=FL or Atlanta>
As far as appealing to authority to discuss appeals to authority, the irony isn’t lost on me. But the real irony is that authorities say the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy, so if the appeal isn’t a fallacy then it would be proven that it’s a fallacy! Its ultimately self-defeating. But do you have any response to the meat of what I’m saying? That “If the authorities believe what they do based off of evidence, then that evidence is where any authority would really be. If they don't believe what they do because of evidence, then their beliefs are not evidence based and thus carry no weight”.

<user_id=FL or Atlanta>
Now as far as the other sources go, it is true that some argue it isn’t a fallacy, but they are a minority among relevant philosophers. According to the book ""Contemporary Debates in the Philosophy of Science"" by Christopher Hitchcock, on page 161 in my copy, it says ""Of prime concern for the issue…are the rules that apply to the researchers themselves. A vocal minority effectively argue their own research transcends empiricism, stating that the public should accept their word by virtue of the fact that it came from one of their standing, and reject it only when others at their level do so. Though the ad verecundiam has such advocates, their expertise resides largely outside of the field of the philosophy of science…Philosophers of science remain in broad unanimity that it is the facts themselves that bring the proof. Those who use their position to express otherwise are…going against their own teachings by…disregarding the consensus of the field on which they speak.""

<user_id=FL or Atlanta>
So it seems like people in other professions sometimes say the appeal to authority isn’t a fallacy. But the consensus in philosophy of science, which is the most relevant specialization, is that it is indeed a fallacy. That seems to be why we get some mixed signals from some sources.

<user_id=FL or Atlanta>
If you’d like, I could cite this section under the appeal to non-authorities form, and make a note of how its argued by some that appeals to authority are only fallacious in that particular form. Would that be an acceptable consensus?

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
You must have missed the following parts, then:
(emphasis added) Note that youtube videos are ''self-published'', and thus not the result of a reliable publication process. Which leads to the section on self-published sources.
(emphasis in original) A HEMA practitioner, even a well-respected one such as this one is not an established expert whose work in the field of logic or philosophy has been published by reliable third-party publications. Even by the overly broad interpretation of the subject of this article you are advocating, this is a completely improper source.
Note that both of those quotations are pulled from the Wikipedia policy page, not the guidelines page. Citing that source is a violation of WP policy. I am removing it again, and if you re-insert it we will take this to arbitration.

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
That is completely untrue. '''Virtually every single resource on the internet''' agrees that there is no fallacy in trusting the word of an established expert, with many of those resources coming from well established, reliable experts in the field. I limited the sources I provided above to educational institutes, but there are many more reliable sources available online. Even the very first source in this article mentions it. I can literally find dozens of reliable sources to state the caveat that appeals to legitimate expertise are not fallacious. You might be able to find a meager handful of sources which don't mention it, and maybe one or two that explicitly deny it. Even then, I doubt they would be very reliable.
That's strange. Because that passage appears nowhere in my copy, nor in the digital copy available online
I gave you multiple examples of philosophy, education and argumentation experts stating this. You gave me a false quote from a book and a martial artist's opinion.
No, because that would violate WP:UNDUE by diminishing an important caveat made by virtually every reliable source on the subject. An acceptable outcome is noting in the lead that it is not considered fallacious to rely upon legitimate expertise, and to alter the examples given so that they aren't exclusively drawn from cases where established experts were wrong.

<user_id=FL or Atlanta>
Like with last time, I'll address the stuff about citation 9 first. He is a published scholar, he co-wrote the book Swordsmen of the British Empire and has participated in projects translating Medieval documents on combat, according to http://www.fioredeiliberi.org/training/. That source also notes that his ""formal educational background is a BA(hons) in Medieval Archaeology and History from University College London (UCL) in 2000, writing his final dissertation on the development of 13th and 14th century armour"". So he is a published and credentialed historian. And, once again, what’s being said in the video isn’t controversial in the least. Also if I might ask, why are you in such a hurry to have the source removed? Talking about edit wars and arbitration and such. Isn't it better to remain calm and discuss the issue until a consensus can be reached?

<user_id=MjolnirPants>
So you're arguing that a degree in history makes one an expert in philosophy? Read below. We will deal with this through arbitration.

<user_id=FL or Atlanta>
Of course not - I'm arguing it means he's a reliable source for the issue he's speaking about there. I did however move the citation to be for how authorities can fall into error, since that's a bit more like what he was speaking about. I also added the skepdic source. I think its very very early for arbitration - arbitration is a last resort, and we're making lots of progress in our discussion! The page has already improved.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Citation and Source Validity**: User MjolnirPants argues that the article does not reflect the sources accurately, particularly regarding the legitimacy of appealing to authority when the authority is a legitimate one. They emphasize the difference between validity and soundness in arguments, which is a critical distinction in logical reasoning. They also provide multiple sources from educational institutions to support their point.

2. **Understanding of Logical Fallacies**: User FL or Atlanta argues that an appeal to authority is always fallacious because it does not provide evidence for the claim. They seem to misunderstand the nuance that an appeal to a legitimate authority on a subject matter is not necessarily fallacious. Their argument is based on the premise that authority itself is not evidence, which is a valid point, but they fail to acknowledge the role of expert consensus in fields like science and education.

3. **Relevance of Sources**: User FL or Atlanta cites a historian and Medieval scholar's video as a source, which MjolnirPants challenges as not being a reliable source for the topic of logical fallacies. MjolnirPants points out that the source does not meet Wikipedia's reliability standards, which is a valid concern in maintaining the integrity of the article.

4. **Consensus and Compromise**: User FL or Atlanta suggests a compromise by citing a section under the appeal to non-authorities form and making a note of the argument that appeals to authority are only fallacious in that particular form. However, MjolnirPants rejects this, stating it would give undue weight to a minority viewpoint and not accurately reflect the majority of reliable sources.

5. **Adherence to Wikipedia Policies**: MjolnirPants correctly points out Wikipedia's policies on reliable sources and self-published material, which is crucial for maintaining the quality of the encyclopedia.

6. **Calm and Constructive Dialogue**: User FL or Atlanta calls for calm and constructive dialogue, suggesting that arbitration is premature. This is a positive approach to resolving disputes on Wikipedia, although it is also important to ensure that the discussion remains focused on the content and policies of Wikipedia.

Overall, the discussion shows a mix of strong understanding of logical reasoning and Wikipedia policies from MjolnirPants, while FL or Atlanta presents arguments that sometimes lack nuance and adherence to Wikipedia's sourcing guidelines. The dialogue could benefit from more focus on finding a consensus that reflects the majority view of reliable sources and Wikipedia's standards.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

<user_id=Jorge alo>
The last academic to write on Beatriz was the spanish Olivera Serrano, on this XXI century, He named is book «Beatriz de Portugal: la pugna dinástica Avis - Trastámara. He speaks of Miguel as an equivocation of genealogists of the XVII and XVIII centuries. He refer three times the question, pages 43, 354 and 397.
His words on page 42 are: «Beatrice had no childs, in spite of the equivoqued affirmations of some genealogists of the XVII and XVIII centuries, that attribute her one called Miguel».
Here it is in spanish: «Beatriz no tuvo hijos, pese a las equivocadas afirmaciones de algunos genealogistas de los siglos XVII e XVIII, que le atribuyen uno llamado Miguel».
Serrano made research and haven't found nothing, unless the «equivocations of genealogists of the XVII and XVIII centuries». He thinks they have made confusion with Miguel da Paz, son of King Manuel I de Portugal. And it's true there's nothing till de XVI century on the historians of Portugal and Castile, because I have made my own research.
So, I think that the German contemporary source of Borgatya followed the error of some of the genealogists referred by Serrano. And that source wasn't the only one. For example, a portuguese historian referred on the portuguese article of Beatrice did the same error. Well, Borgatya wants to make an article thats affirm as true an error. And is for this I'm opposed.
Another question, in the article Beatrice of Portugal, is «the claim» in 1383. It is Juan I himself, on his testament, that says there were two claims: his own and the  claim of Beatriz. You want to delete Juan I himself? And both the Chronicles of Ayala and Fernão Lopes explain very well that Juan I had is own claim.
So, if Borgatya persists, in spite of this explanation, on the ""undo"" in Beatrice, and in reediting an article about someone that never existed, I have to put the problem to the administrators.
Salutations,

<user_id=Borgatya>
If I read Jorge's words well it still remains: one statement one denial, so you (judges), admins are prudent, you cannot rely a delation on one denial.

<user_id=Jorge alo>
No it is not one denial: The denials are from all the chronists till de XVI century. And more, Ayala wrote «there were no childs». So, when you say I only give one state you are reading me wrong, at least. And one thing is an kind of general genealogical almanac and other thing is a research of a spanish academic in is own land. More, everybody knows that, evem in our days, genealogical works are plenty of errors.

<user_id=Borgatya>
The Portuguese want to eliminate Beatriz reign, and they do not want to consider her as queen regnant of Portugal. So to this viewpoint it is not surprise that Beatriz's son is considered as phantom. Jorge's sorces do not eliminate my sources because Europäischen Stammtafeln are serious genealogy work. And the German precision is famous. So Jorge's sources can be handled with some debts and criticism. Suppose, Jorge is right (provided but not allowed), I ask: why was Jorge afraid about the discussion if the truth is on his side. If I know, I am right, I am not afraid to discuss and defend my truth. The main evidence that he is not right that he is afraid of discussion and wanted to delete it without discussing it. And Phantomsteve should have got this article discussed on the pages above earlier instead of infamous deletion.

<user_id=Jorge alo>
Give us the sources that the «German precision» used. Are they genealogists of the XVII or XVIII century? You are negating all the historians til the XVII century, amid them Ayala,Fernão Lopes, Froissart, etc., etc. For you the History is what? And «the portuguese want to eliminate Beatriz reign»!? What is this? If the Portuguese, in that time, could not considerer her their queen because of the pretensions of her husband, it's you that is going to oblige the actual Portuguese to recognize her as one of their past queen?

<user_id=Borgatya>
And If Beatriz's son was confused then how his birth date was created. It is weird and incredible that the fakers chose the year 1384 when Beatriz was only twelve (sic)!!!! She and John were married until 1390, so Beatriz got a widow when she was 18 so it would be more logic that Beatriz might give birth to her phantom son in an later time, if his existence is fictional. It is not impossible that a woman may bear a child at the age of twelve but the fakers can have chosen a more credible year. And why did the little prince die in 1385 at the age of 1 because Miguel da Paz, Prince of Portugal was two years old when he died. If there is only confusion, the essential elements of data should be equal: birth: 1398 instead of 1498 and 1400 instead of 1500. If one sees these dates, one observes that these dates are similar to Peter of Aragon (heir of Sicily), so Jorge says: Prince Peter was also phantom?:))) because this follows of his arguments!! If anyone says, it is nonsense, he is right. But it is not nonsense because some users similar to Jorge wanted to delete the article Peter of Aragon but it was unsuccessful action, too and I managed to defend against the attackers.:))

<user_id=Jorge alo>
This: «The main evidence that he is not right that he is afraid of discussion and wanted to delete it without discussing it», it's a Falacy, and all your paragraph above are falacies. I never said here that she couldn't have a son with eleven years (and not twelve), but the problem is where it is written that was borned a child named Miguel in 1384, dead in 1385, in a Cronicle? in a church document? in the archives of Castile? Where? Yes, I already know it is written with «German precision», but also is written by António Caetano de Sousa and other genealogists since the XVII century, like you wrote the same affirmation here, in Wikipedia. The problem is there are any sources to that affirmation. If you discover one, my congratulations. Salut,

<user_id=Borgatya>
I think, you misunderstood and misinterpreted my words. Your sources at least claim that they do not know about her son but my sources above exactly claims that she gave birth to a son. Even If his existence is disputed, the deletion is wrong solution, I do not understand your
ruthlessness. But it's not me who you must convince about your truth.

<user_id=Jorge alo>
The medieval sources dont´t «at least claim that they do not know about her son», the sources speak that she had no sons or don't refer any sons of that marriage. The contemporary source Olivera Serrano, on a book all about Beatrice's question, so, a specialized work, says she had no sons and that this affirmation: «she had a son named Miguel» was a equivocation of genealogists of the XVII and XVIII centuries. He has access to the archives of Castile and Aragon and couldn'f find nothing. But you are a believer on «German precision» and on the «Queen Regnant Beatrice». what can we do more? You are a believer that want to give us his truth and we are rude...The problem here is not a matter of truth, yours or mine, it's a problem of sources. Salut,

<user_id=DrKay>
The article should at least balance both points of view. Please insert the Serrano material and adjust the text in the article to present the two views as alternatives. Currently, it only presents one side, which is clearly bias.

<user_id=Jorge alo>
I have no point of view about the subject, if there was a child and was named Miguel, very well, that will be a subject, but I defend (this, yes, is a point of view) Wikipedia sources politic must put clear one thing: a called second or third source ''only'' is a real second or third source if she has one or more primary sources studied. If she has not, she isn´t a source at all, it´s mere affirmations. António Caetano de Sousa, a portuguese genealogist of the XVIII century, wrote that affirmation (HGCRP, I, page 440), and gives, near, as source, Duarte Nunes de Leão. We can read not only the pages appointed by António Caetano but all the historical works of Duarte Nunes de Leão and we dont´t find nothing. We don't find any reference to such Infante in any chronist even till, at least, Juan de Mariana, and he died in 1624. There is no primary document atesting the birth of such individual, all we have is mere affirmations, as Serrano said, of genealogists of the XVII an XVIII. Probably, the german publication referred by Borgatya collected that notice in some of these ""sources"" (that aren't sources), and so the German publication isn't, too, a source. But we have, by hasard, a primary source that says there were no childrens of Juan I after is first marriage: it's Ayala, on «Henry the third», page 500, Madrid edition, 1780. A spanish academics, in this XXI century, make a specialized work about Beatrice, defending his own opinions, and atest that there are no primary documents about Miguel. If there are no primary documents, and what we have is only mere affirmations of writers three centuries forward, how can we write anything about such "" biographical subject""?
My response is: in the particular case here on discussion, the Miguel hipotetic existence, we do not have nothing atesting it, and we can´t write an article giving life to a XVII and XVIII genealogist's phantom; as subject, we only have here an epistemological question to present, and not a biography to do, and so this biographycal article can't exist, as is written in the Wikipedia instructions, «""If a topic has no reliable sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it""», but we can put the epistemological question on Beatrice or Juan I pages, as we did in wikipedia on portuguese. And in the general question, can we consider as source someone that only make mere affirmations about the historic past without any primary source or element, my answer is, of course, no. Even when someone presents a thesis on history, he gives the elements where his thesis is founded, and I repeat, in this particular case there is nothing, ''there are no primary sources'' and, for this reason, '' also there are no second or third sources''.

<user_id=Jorge alo>
As this is a epistemological problem, I ask to invite to this discussion all the historians working on english Wikipedia, and not only those (if they exist) specialized on medieval portuguese history. I think it wil be interessant and useful for Wikipedia.

<user_id=DrKay>
Look, it's obvious that Miguel was imaginary as his mother was only 10 years old at his supposed birth. The question is over how to reconcile the obvious falsehood against the sources that claim he did exist. The page isn't going to be deleted. The best we can hope for is to add the fact that Miguel was a later fiction.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. Borgatya presents a source, ""Europäische Stammtafeln,"" which claims the existence of Miguel, an infant of Portugal and Castile. This source is challenged by Jorge alo, who cites modern academic research by Olivera Serrano, stating that the claim of Miguel's existence is a mistake by genealogists of the 17th and 18th centuries.

2. Jorge alo argues that medieval sources do not mention a son for Beatriz and that contemporary research by Serrano, who had access to relevant archives, found no evidence of such a child. This suggests that the claim of Miguel's existence lacks primary source evidence.

3. Borgatya counters by questioning the birth date assigned to the supposed child and argues that if the existence of Miguel was a fabrication, a more plausible date would have been chosen. This argument attempts to cast doubt on the idea that Miguel was a complete fabrication.

4. Jorge alo points out that the issue is not about whether Beatriz could have had a child at a young age but rather the absence of any primary sources or chronicles mentioning a child named Miguel born to Beatriz.

5. DrKay intervenes, suggesting that the article should present both points of view to maintain neutrality. DrKay also acknowledges that Miguel's existence is highly unlikely given the age of Beatriz at the supposed time of his birth.

6. Jorge alo further emphasizes the importance of primary sources in historical writing and argues that without primary documentation, the existence of Miguel cannot be substantiated.

7. The discussion involves a mix of historical interpretation, source evaluation, and epistemological considerations. Both parties present arguments, but Jorge alo's insistence on primary source evidence aligns with standard historical methodology.

8. The discussion also touches on the broader issue of how Wikipedia should handle information that is derived from sources that may themselves be based on errors or fabrications.

Overall, the discussion is robust, with participants providing detailed arguments and counterarguments. The participants are engaged in a substantive debate about historical accuracy and the reliability of sources, which is central to the integrity of historical articles on Wikipedia. The discussion is coherent, and the participants are respectful, even though they have differing viewpoints.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
Karasek, please don't try to edit war over this image . Your previous edit summary was that it is not ""relevant to the history of the city"". It very obviously is.

<user_id=Karasek>
The Polish community dropped from a meagre 4-5.000 in 1918 to a statistically insignificant residue two decaded later. (Davies, Microcosm, page 361). 4-5.000 Poles in a city of 550.000 people means less than 1% were Poles in 1918. And many of them left after 1918. Please tell me why a shrinking community of less than 1% is notable and so relevant to the history of the city that a picture connected to this tiny minority has to be shown for this period of time?

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
Because the city is now part of Poland. So the history of the Polish minority within the city is important and obviously relevant. The very fact that this minority is being discussed shows notability. Whether you IDON'TLIKEIT or not. There's no justification for the removal of the pic, or some of the removal of the relevant text, as you've done.

<user_id=Karasek>
Less than 4.000 people in a city of 550.000 aren't a minority, they are insignificant. And as long as no one presents a source that proves that the allies decided to award Breslau to Poland because of the Poles in the city, or that the Poles in the city planned a coup d'état to turn the city into a Polish one, they only represent themselves... a statistical footnote in a German city.

<user_id=MyMoloboaccount>
Karasek...""in a German city"" ? Wroclaw is a Polish city Karasek, I really find this statement strange.  Thus its Polish history is important, as demonstrated by its treatment in book on the subject by Davies.

<user_id=Karasek>
In the mentioned era the city was German.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. <user_id=Volunteer Marek> argues that the history of the Polish minority within the city is important and relevant because the city is now part of Poland. This argument appeals to the current political status of the city and the relevance of its historical minority populations within that context. The argument is coherent and relevant to the discussion of historical significance.

2. <user_id=Karasek> counters by stating that the Polish community was very small in comparison to the total population of the city at the time in question and argues that unless there is evidence that the Polish minority had a significant impact on the city's history or its transfer to Poland, their presence is a statistical footnote. This argument is based on the proportion of the population and the perceived impact of the minority group. It is a factual argument that requires historical context to evaluate its relevance.

3. <user_id=MyMoloboaccount> supports the inclusion of the Polish history by referencing a book by Davies, suggesting that the Polish history of the city is well-documented and recognized in historical literature. This argument appeals to authority (the work of a historian) and suggests that the historical significance of the Polish minority is established in academic work.

4. <user_id=Karasek> reiterates that during the era in question, the city was German, implying that the Polish minority's relevance to the city's history should be considered in the context of the city's predominant national identity at the time. This is a valid point but does not directly address the arguments about the current relevance of the Polish minority's history to the city's identity.

Overall, the arguments presented by all parties are based on different perspectives of historical significance and relevance. <user_id=Volunteer Marek> and <user_id=MyMoloboaccount> focus on the current status of the city and the established historical literature, while <user_id=Karasek> emphasizes the proportional size of the minority and its impact at the time. The discussion is civil and each user provides reasoning for their position, though there is a clear disagreement on the weight that should be given to the historical presence of a minority group in the context of the city's history.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7. The discussion is well-structured, with each participant providing clear arguments and referencing historical context. However, there is a lack of consensus on the criteria for historical relevance, which is a subjective matter and could be further explored for a more comprehensive understanding.",7.0

dubious statements

A great deal of this territory and its settlers subsequently became the western edge of Rus' principality at the start of the 9th century
This territory did not belong to the Rus around 800. There is no reliable source about it.
Prince Laborec fell from power under the efforts of the Hungarians and the Kievan forces
Prince Laborec was a fictive person. There is no reliable source about it.
Local Ruthenian nobility often intermarried with the Hungarian nobles to the south.
Local Ruthenian nobility in Carpathian Ruthenia around 1000? And this group intermarried with Hungarian nobles? There is no reliable source about it.

<user_id=PANONIAN>
Well, Fakirbakir, I do not see that you provided any source for any of your own claims. Do you have any source that can confirm your statements? Anyway, here is evidence that Carpathian Ruthenia was part of Kievan Rus: http://faculty.unlv.edu/pwerth/Kievan-Rus'-11thcent.jpg And here are also numerous sources about Prince Laborec: .

<user_id=Fakirbakir>
Your source did not mention that Carpathian Ruthenia belonged to the Rus in the 9th century. Moreover Prince Laborec is a fictive legendary person, written by Anatolij Kralickij (in 1863).

<user_id=Fakirbakir>
Source about ""Prince Laborec""

<user_id=Fakirbakir>
Prince Laborec is a tale, the Kievian Rus was established in !!882!! and before that the Novgorodian Rus did not have any influence on this territory. So, the Rus in Carpathian Ruthenia at the start of 9th century is not correct. Moreover the Hungarian Etelköz (today south/southwest Ukraine, Moldova) was the eastern neighbour of Carpathian Ruthenia in the 9th century. The descendants of White Croat nobles could have intermarried with Hungarian nobles, but Ruthenian nobles could not, because there was no such a thing as ""Ruthenian nobles"" in the 9/10 th centuries in Carpathian Ruthenia.

<user_id=PANONIAN>
I disagree with your interpretation. Firstly, we cannot conclude from this source that prince Laborec was not real person. I do not even think that term ""historical tale"" is an correct English translation of ""istoryčna povist"". ""povist"" is general Slavic word for ""story"", no matter if that story is real or invented. In modern Croatian ""povijest"" means simply ""history"". Furthermore, here we have two additional sources that speaking about Prince Laborec like about real person: , . As for the Carpathian Ruthenia in the 9th century and Ruthenian nobles, I will investigate this issue further, but, you still did not provided sources that saying that these two statements are incorrect.

<user_id=Fakirbakir>
I think Ruthenian nobles (alias nobles of Rus) intermarried with Hungarian nobles, but that is a latter effect, it started probably from the 11th century. I did read somewhere that Hungarian chiefs had Varangian bodyguards in the 10th century and they could have been ""Ruthenian nobles"", however the Varangians did not belong to Carpathian Ruthenia. They were simple mercenaries from North.

<user_id=PANONIAN>
Well, I changed term to ""Slavic nobility"" since some of them indeed might be White Croats. Is that OK to you? Do you consider anything else disputed?

<user_id=Fakirbakir>
It is much better now. Actually Prince Laborec is still dubious to me, I will add different opinions about it.

2. The second user, PANONIAN, asks for sources to back up Fakirbakir's claims and provides a link to a map as evidence that Carpathian Ruthenia was part of Kievan Rus. However, the map does not address the specific time period in question (the 9th century).

3. Fakirbakir responds by pointing out that the provided source does not support the claim about the 9th century and asserts that Prince Laborec is a fictional character from a story written in the 19th century.

4. PANONIAN suggests that the term ""historical tale"" does not necessarily mean the story is fictional and provides additional sources that treat Prince Laborec as a real person. However, PANONIAN also acknowledges the need for further investigation regarding Carpathian Ruthenia in the 9th century and Ruthenian nobles.

5. Fakirbakir concedes that Ruthenian nobles may have intermarried with Hungarian nobles but argues that this would have occurred later, starting from the 11th century. The user also introduces the idea that Hungarian chiefs may have had Varangian bodyguards, who could be considered ""Ruthenian nobles,"" but clarifies that these were mercenaries from the North, not from Carpathian Ruthenia.

6. PANONIAN agrees to change the term to ""Slavic nobility"" to accommodate the possibility of White Croats being involved, showing a willingness to compromise and update the information based on the discussion.

7. Fakirbakir accepts the change but maintains skepticism about Prince Laborec, indicating a willingness to add different opinions to the article.

Evaluation of Discussion Quality:

The discussion shows a good level of engagement between the two users, with both presenting arguments and counterarguments. Fakirbakir provides historical context and challenges the accuracy of the statements, while PANONIAN seeks to defend the edits with sources, though the relevance of these sources is questioned. Both users show a willingness to engage with the evidence and to refine their positions based on the information presented. The discussion is focused on factual accuracy and the interpretation of historical sources, which is a positive aspect of the debate. However, there is a lack of definitive sources that conclusively support or refute the claims, leading to an impasse in some areas.

Overall, the discussion is civil, constructive, and shows a genuine effort to reach a consensus or at least to present a balanced view of the historical issues. The users are cooperative in considering different viewpoints and making adjustments to the language used to describe historical events and figures.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Indian Tamils

<user_id=117.192.218.44>
Indian tamils are not stateless, it has to be the most absurd thing i have ever come across, it's very biased propaganda. Tamil Nadu is where majority of Tamils live and we don't identify anything other than Indian and Tamil. Tamil is one of many official languages of India and also has classical language status.

<user_id=Vatasura>
Tamil is not only an official language but a national language in Sri Lanka, that is not a good argument and does not explain why Tamils are no stateless nation. Tamils in Tamil Nadu supports a Tamil state in Sri Lanka. Tamil organizations, parties and the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu demand an International Investigation of Sri Lankan war crimes and a UN referendum among Sri Lankan Tamils on the formation of Tamil Eelam.
Tamils as a whole are a stateless nation. Tamil claim to be a nation but there is no sovereign Tamil state, That's why Tamils are a stateless nation ( a nation without a sovereign state). Indian Tamils dont need to ask for a separate state to be a stateless nation. If Tamils consider themselves a nation and somewhere in the world exists a movement for a Tamil state, then Tamils as whole are a stateless nation. To claim that Sri Lankan Tamils are stateless nation and India Tamils not, makes no sense, because both are the same ethnic group and so also the same nation.

<user_id=Vatasura>
Difference between stateless people and stateless nation
Tamils are not a stateless people, because most Tamils are citizens of Sri Lanka, India or other countries. Tamils are a stateless nation, because as a nation, they don't have a sovereign state.

<user_id=117.192.218.39>
State and Nation in South Asia By Swarna Rajagopalan - Covers basic aspects of how Indian Tamils and Sri Lankan Tamils view the idea of stateless nation. Only Sri Lankan Tamils see themselves as stateless nation in almost all sources i have found.  https://books.google.co.in/books?id=q7Yz5aGeoTsC&lpg;=PP1&pg;=PA82#v=onepage&q;=Tamils&f;=false  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=117.192.218.39>
Neither do majority of ethnic groups in India, yet we don't go around claiming we are ""stateless nation"", which is absurd. This concept of stateless nation only applies to Sri Lankan Tamils who are demanding Tamil Eelam NOT Indian Tamils. Some political movements in Tamil Nadu may support Eelam nation but that does not mean we want to leave India. There is difference between Indian Tamils and Sri lankan-Tamils when it comes to politics, we are fully absorbed into Indian identity and society and have always been. Same can't be said about Sri Lankan-Tamils and Sinhalese in modern times.

<user_id=Vatasura>
We have not even finished our discussion and you're already imposing your POV on Tamil people. Probably you have a ulterior motive to divide Tamils and to deny the Tamil nationalism.The entire Tamil population belongs to a nation and this Tamil nation has no sovereign state, which makes Tamils to the largest stateless nation in the world.

<user_id=Vatasura>
Tamil organizations, parties and the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu '''demand''' an International Investigation of Sri Lankan war crimes and a UN referendum among Sri Lankan Tamils on the formation of Tamil Eelam.
Why do you support something that you do not demand? Yes Tamils in India, Malaysia and Singapore demanding openly a separate Tamil Eelam (a tamil state) in Sri Lanka.

<user_id=Vatasura>
Not only Sri Lankan Tamils deal with an independent Tamil state. Tamil secession movement even existed in India in the past. Indian government had added a legislation that outlawed anyone wanting independence from India and so the Tamil secession movement in India got weaker. You can not deny this because it's history.
A famous quote by Tamil poet Kannadasan about the Tamils as stateless nation.Historical Dictionary of the Tamils (2007), p. 319.
I think you dont understand the meaning of this.

<user_id=117.192.210.109>
Only person who is imposing anything here is YOU with your ""77 million tamils being stateless nation"" are you insane? It's obviously propaganda! You'll be laughed at your face if you asked anyone from Tamil Nadu about wanting separate nation for Indian Tamils or to join Eelam.

<user_id=117.192.210.109>
Again, just because some Indian parties have solidarity with Sri Lankan Tamils for Eelam state does NOT mean Indian Tamils want to secede from Indian union, even you know that.

<user_id=117.192.210.109>
I too can quote Indian nationalist Tamils left and right but you already know that Indian Tamils and Sri Lankan Tamils are ''politically different'' today, just because we show solidarity with Eelam Tamils does not mean we want to secede from India.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The first user (117.192.218.44) argues that Indian Tamils do not see themselves as a stateless nation and identifies strongly with both Indian and Tamil identities. They also point out that Tamil is an official language in India, which is a sign of recognition and integration within the Indian state.

2. The second user (Vatasura) counters by saying that the concept of a stateless nation is not tied to the need for a separate state within India but is about the broader Tamil identity across international borders, including the desire for a Tamil state in Sri Lanka. They argue that Tamil nationalism transcends national borders and that support for Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka by Tamils in India is indicative of a broader Tamil stateless nation.

3. The third user (117.192.218.39) references a source that discusses the concept of a stateless nation, emphasizing that it is primarily Sri Lankan Tamils who see themselves as such. They argue that the majority of Indian ethnic groups, including Indian Tamils, do not claim to be a stateless nation.

4. The second user (Vatasura) continues to assert that Tamil nationalism is a unifying factor for Tamils worldwide and that the lack of a sovereign Tamil state makes them a stateless nation. They also mention historical movements for Tamil secession in India and the existence of laws against secession as evidence of past Tamil nationalism within India.

5. The first user (117.192.210.109) strongly disagrees, stating that the idea of 77 million Tamils being a stateless nation is propaganda and not reflective of the views of Indian Tamils. They also clarify that support for Tamil Eelam does not equate to a desire for secession from India.

6. The first user (117.192.210.109) reiterates that political solidarity with Sri Lankan Tamils does not imply a desire for Indian Tamils to secede from India.

The discussion quality is mixed. On one hand, there are valid points made about the distinction between Indian Tamils' integration within India and the separate political situation of Sri Lankan Tamils. On the other hand, there is a lack of consensus on the definition and application of the term ""stateless nation,"" and the discussion sometimes veers into accusations of propaganda without fully addressing the other side's arguments. The discussion could benefit from more sources and a clearer distinction between the concepts of ""stateless nation"" and ""stateless people.""

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

A herb/an herb

<user_id=Jytdog>
the community put WP:ENGVAR in place exactly because there is no rational way to resolve a style dispute like this.   The notion is that if English style X is established in article, don't change it without prior consensus.   Without that piece of the MOS in place, articles would be beset by endless edit wars over style issues that would then generate endless RfCs or other forms of DR that would become a time sink across the encyclopedia.  Please get consensus to change i; this is not something you can do unilaterally, much less across several articles.

<user_id=Porphyro>
Hi , I am aware of WP:ENGVAR, and would like to point out to you the policy says that one should ""use the variety found in the first post-stub revision that introduced an identifiable variety"". In the case of this article, that is ""a herb"", which was introduced in the original article. Additionally, in the above discussion, it appears to me that what consensus there was, was formed on the side of ""a herb"".

<user_id=Jytdog>
it is what it is and it already was ""an herb"" when the previous editor (now indeffed) starting messing with it. just leave it alone already.

<user_id=Porphyro>
Be that as it may, per policy it should be ""a herb"" on this page, and your advice to ""leave it alone"" could just as easily be applied to yourself. I will leave the current wording for a few weeks to see if anyone else decides to weigh in, and intend to then change the page to align with policy.

<user_id=Jytdog>
It is '''impossible''' to get local consensus on this kind of thing, which is why ENGVAR exists.  Leave it alone, or waste the community's time with an RFC but stop wasting your time and mine making useless arguments here.  I don't care if it says ""an "" or ""a"" - what is not acceptable is messing with it.

<user_id=Porphyro>
I don't really see the point of opening an RFC. We have an administrator's comment on this page clarifying that policy is for ""a"" and even indicating his intention to change it, which may have happened and been reverted. Such a change is exactly per the ENGVAR policy, we should change it and stick to it. This is not ""messing with it"". I suggest you allow such an edit to stick instead of reverting and we can draw a line under this matter. You've referred me to the policy twice in this thread; how about we follow it? Why is pointing out that it clearly delineates which version we should use here a ""useless argument""?

<user_id=Porphyro>
3RR applies within a 24 hour period and I don't think is relevant. I admit that when I made those edits, I didn't realise it was actually a ENGVAR issue but rather just a mistake, hence my zeal in making the changes. You'll note that I have not reverted the Lemon Balm revert you made; I checked the history for the article and the initial stylisation was for ""an herb"" and so per policy that's what it should be. On this article, policy dictates it should be ""a herb"". I will note, though, that I have reverted your edit once, and you have reverted mine twice. This would put you closer to violating ""3RR"" than it would me, and my suggested edit is totally in line with established policy and administrator suggestion, as covered above. I think it is wrong to suggest that the onus is on me to get an RFC: you are the one pushing a point of view specifically against wikipedia policy. To emphasise: the ENGVAR policy exists to unamIbiguously resolve these debates and for this article, it should be ""a herb"".  I see no real arguments for the contrary, and for what it's worth, my having made policy-incorrect edits (in good faith), doesn't diminish the fact that policy is clear on this one.

<user_id=Jytdog>
I have warned you to walk away from being a style warrior and wasting everyone's time. You will do as you will.

<user_id=Porphyro>
You are being the style warrior here on the side of ""an herb"", insisting on your viewpoint against policy.

<user_id=Porphyro>
No one further has weighed in on this and so I am making the change in accordance with policy, as I have done on each of the herb-related pages that you noticed I had edited, reverting a few of them to the ""an herb"" style. Each of these articles is now in accordance with WP:ENGVAR. Please do not edit it without an RFC or DR. We are now within the spirit and letter of policy on each of these pages and I hope we can draw a line under this ridiculous matter.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Understanding of Policy: Both users demonstrate an understanding of Wikipedia's Manual of Style and ENGVAR policy, which is meant to prevent edit wars over English language varieties. User Porphyro cites the policy accurately, stating that the article should use the variety found in the first post-stub revision that introduced an identifiable variety.

2. Consistency with Policy: User Porphyro argues for consistency with the policy, providing evidence that the original article used ""a herb"" and that this should be respected according to ENGVAR. User Jytdog, on the other hand, seems to be arguing more from a standpoint of maintaining the status quo to avoid further conflict, rather than strictly adhering to the policy.

3. Argumentation: User Porphyro presents a clear and consistent argument, referencing the policy and the history of the article to support their position. User Jytdog's argument is less about the policy and more about the practicality of avoiding endless debates, which is also a valid concern but does not directly address the policy issue at hand.

4. Civility: The discussion remains relatively civil, although there is a clear frustration from User Jytdog, who warns User Porphyro to walk away from being a ""style warrior."" User Porphyro maintains a focus on policy throughout the discussion.

5. Resolution Focus: User Porphyro suggests a path forward that aligns with the policy and offers a resolution to the dispute. User Jytdog seems more resigned and does not offer a clear alternative solution, instead emphasizing the futility of the debate.

Overall, the discussion quality is moderate. Both parties are engaged and present arguments, but there is a clear difference in the approach to resolving the issue. User Porphyro's arguments are more policy-focused and aim for a resolution based on Wikipedia's established guidelines, while User Jytdog's arguments are more pragmatic, focusing on the potential for wasted time and effort.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Editorializing
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Somali_Civil_War&diff;=751693393&oldid;=751392683
I must protest the insistence some have on editorializing. I did not question the alleged truth of the idea that the UN has authority, I questioned the idea's objectivity. Because the removal of editorializing was marked as unexplained, I had to explain it as removing editorializing.
As you can see, I've already been through this with Buckshot06.

<user_id=Cordless Larry>
Can you please explain what you see as editorialising? Things like replacing ""central authority"" with ""State"" (why the capital S) don't seem to be about removing editorialising to me.

<user_id=130.105.212.112>
This is going to be a long post. You did ask for an explanation, after all.
I hope this is an answer to your question: maybe editorializing is not the thing wrong with ""Things like replacing ""central authority"" with 'State'"", but a Wikipedia article content page is still definitely a wrong venue for taking sides. Calling it an ""authority"" means that it has the right to do what it's doing, and if it's abused and exceeded its authority, then that's an abuse that somehow isn't really an abuse. Whichever of multiple similar rules apply here, the rule or rules definitely forbid using judgemental language. For example, you might as well call Siad Barre's administration ""the heroes"" as call them ""the villains"" or ""the regime"", and you might as well call UNOSOM ""the rescuers"", ""the war machine"" or ""the foreign interlopers"" as call a State ""the authorities"" or ""central authority"". It's a package deal - once you allow an administration to be called a ""regime"", or a State to be called an ""authority"", central or otherwise, so many people will so passionately try to put their POV in there, you might as well just lock any page that says anything about politics or the State so only admins can edit it. So Barre's administration is called nothing more or less than that - his administration. It's not as if you can't have your opinion about his administration, and it's not as if there aren't public venues where you may express that opinion to an audience. I have an opinion about it too - which is why I don't have to be reminded of it.
Another thing going on here is that  seems to be treating accuracy as the same thing as objectivity, as if all truths were objectively true. I am not sure that he knows I questioned only the alleged objectivity of the statement that the UN gave authority to the troop movements to take place, rather than the alleged truth of the statement. I tried explaining it to him at length, and as I post this, he has not yet responded. This will be what passes for clear upon visiting the section of the talk page I sent you.
This is going to be a long, caffeinated, meandering explanation the length, caffeination, and meandering of which and its presence in a conversation in which so far people have had an unexpected and severe difficulty in communicating with each other necessitates an explicit, kind of bizarre but, on its own terms, quite logical writing style. Where applicable, the explanation's information structure is given a rudimentary, explicit marking with the ""[FOCUS] f"" syntax. Consider the all-caps text in the square brackets followed with the sub-scripted letter FOXTROT to be in focus. Otherwise, consider the text in those of the square brackets that do not make the contents into a link, to be the nonce attitudinal.
[The following sentence [ESTABLISHES THE REASON WHY WHAT'S LEFT OF THE EXPLANATION IS BEING MADE] f.] You also asked about the reason for the upper case letter Sierra.
[The following sentence [IS THE THESIS] f.] The reason [IS CLARITY] f.
[The following paragraph [IS A SUPPORTING ARGUMENT FOR THE THESIS] f.] [WHEN THE FIRST LETTER IN A SENTENCE IS LOWER CASE, WHEN THE WORD ""State"" IS AT THE FRONT OF A SENTENCE, AND WHEN ALL THE LETTERS ARE UPPER CASE] f, the word ""State"" is ambiguous. It could have the meaning often shared by words such as [""STATUS"" AND ""CONDITION"", OR IT COULD MEAN ""A SINGLE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT"", BY WHICH WIKIPEDIA DOES NOT MEAN ""ADMINISTRATION""] f. This is opaque in English because [IN AMERICAN ENGLISH, THE WORD ""GOVERNMENT"" MEANS 'State', BUT IN OTHER DIALECTS OF ENGLISH, THE WORD ""GOVERNMENT"" MEANS ""ADMINISTRATION""] f . For an example of the State-administration distinction, when Tony Blair left office, his administration ended, but not because of any armed insurgency that would have taken the countryside and cities that aren't London by force of arms. But Barre's State ended because he was no longer hypocritical enough to sustain the clan loyalty he exhibited that kept him loyal to his power base despite making clan loyalty illegal, but more relevantly his State ended because his power base retaliated against his State by no longer being his power base and by coming to support one or more of the active armed insurgencies that took the countryside, and ultimately the country, by force of arms. But when the first letter in the word ""State"" is upper case and the other letters in the word are lower case and the word is not the first one in the sentence, then it is much more likely to mean the latter.
[The following paragraph [IS WHERE THE EXPLANATION MEANDERS IN EARNEST, BY BEING NOT STRICTLY RELEVANT] f.] In English, this kind of opacity and complexity is routine, [BUT IN ESPERANTO, THIS PROBLEM IS RARE BUT DOES HAPPEN] f. For example, the meaning ""status"" and ""condition"" share with ""state"" [IS DENOTED BY ""STATO""] f, but the latter meaning [IS DENOTED BY ""REGISTARO"" OR ""ŜTATO""] f. The little hat on the letter Sierra [MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE] f.
[The following sentence [IS THE CONCLUSION AND IS MEANT HALF-SERIOUSLY, AND HALF-INDIFFERENTLY TO WHETHER IT IS FUNNY, NOW THAT THE ""COST DRIVERS"" SPEECH, WHICH HAS A SIMILAR ENDING, WAS MADE] f.] Was that [CLEAR] f, or would you like [FOR ME TO TRY AGAIN] f?

<user_id=Cordless Larry>
You appear to be confusing two meanings of the word ""authority"", IP editor. As for your explanation of the capitalisation of state, I'm afraid I don't understand what you are trying to argue.

<user_id=130.105.197.204>
I don't get it. Which two meanings? As for my explanation of the capitalisation of ""state"", which part do you want for me to clarify and why was it unclear?

<user_id=Cordless Larry>
If you follow the link I gave to a dictionary, you'll see ""the moral or legal right or ability to control"" and ""a group of people with official responsibility for a particular area of activity"". Regarding the capitalisation of state, I didn't get any of your explanation. I don't see anything in Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters that suggests that it should be capitalised.

<user_id=130.105.213.181>
About the two meanings: I misread the page and assumed that there were more than two meanings. I didn't really agree with the definition. The problem is partly with lexical definitions, such as what you'd find in the dictionary. I prefer theoretical definitions, such as in encyclopedias, textbooks, or some sort of simulation. But to accept both that the definition is lexical and to further accept the content of the definition ""as it were"", when you call someone or something an authority or the authorities, that is the same thing as saying they have authority. When you call a State by the word for ""a group of people with official responsibility for a particular area of activity"", it is editorializing or POV or something because it calls the State a group of people with official responsibility for a particular area of activity. In the dictionary, it's two entries with two different wordings, but in practice in cases like this, ""official responsibility"" is the same thing as ""the moral or legal right or ability to control"". The statement that the State has official responsibility materially implies the statement that the State has the moral or legal right or ability to control. Neither the antecedent nor the consequent in that material implication have any place on Wikipedia, whether it's because of WP:TRUTH, WP:POV, or WP:EDITORIALIZING or anything else. The dictionary defined it like so:

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Understanding of Wikipedia Policies**: The discussion revolves around Wikipedia's policies on neutrality and the use of language. The IP editor (130.105.196.215 and subsequent IPs) argues that using the term ""authority"" implies a right to control, which they believe is not neutral. Cordless Larry seeks clarification and references Wikipedia's Manual of Style, which does not support the capitalization of ""state"" as the IP editor suggests.

2. **Clarity of Arguments**: The IP editor's arguments are convoluted and difficult to follow. They use a unique and complex structure to present their points, which includes bracketed focus markers and a mix of capitalization for emphasis. This style is not standard and makes the argument hard to understand. Cordless Larry, on the other hand, presents clear and concise questions and statements.

3. **Relevance of Arguments**: The IP editor's arguments about the capitalization of ""state"" and the distinction between ""state"" and ""administration"" are relevant to the discussion about neutrality and editorializing. However, the lengthy and meandering explanation detracts from the argument's relevance. Cordless Larry's request for clarification and reference to the dictionary definition are directly relevant to the discussion.

4. **Factual Accuracy**: Cordless Larry provides a dictionary definition to clarify the meanings of ""authority"" and challenges the IP editor's interpretation. The IP editor's claim about the capitalization of ""state"" is not supported by the Wikipedia Manual of Style, which Cordless Larry points out.

5. **Coherence**: Cordless Larry's arguments are coherent and follow a logical structure. The IP editor's arguments lack coherence due to their complex structure and writing style, which obscures the points they are trying to make.

6. **Rhetorical Strategies**: The IP editor uses a unique rhetorical strategy with their bracketed focus markers, which is unconventional and does not aid in the clarity of their argument. Cordless Larry uses standard rhetorical strategies, such as asking for clarification and providing evidence.

Overall, the discussion quality is hindered by the IP editor's complex and unclear argumentation style. Cordless Larry's contributions are clear and relevant, but they are not enough to elevate the overall quality of the discussion significantly.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 4.5",4.5

The Color of Crime

<user_id=Miradre>
The report, from the New Century Foundation, as a source have been removed from the article. Please explain why. Reports from advocacy groups are not prohibited. It certainly passes a relevancy and notability criteria since it is widely cited in this area. The statistics of the report are from official statistics and reports in the scientific literature. If there is disagreement with a figure, then an opposing view should be stated with a source. Just attacking the author and not the content is a not valid ad hominem attack. As such, I propose the report should be added back.

<user_id=CordeliaNaismith>
I don't think it's a reliable source. If you think it is, take it to the Reliable Sources noticeboard.

<user_id=CordeliaNaismith>
Also, I see that a user has just removed the citations to The Color of Crime without removing the information from the source.  I've removed the now-unsourced material from the article.

<user_id=Miradre>
I may, but I would be interesting to hear your reason for why it is not a reliable source. Let me rephrase. We should not state that the report contains the WP:Truth on this matter but that as a notable view on this topic it should be included as per WP:NPOV.

<user_id=Maunus>
It is not a reliable4 source because it is a report by a political advocacy group which does not live up to the standards of WP:RS or indeed to any academic standard. It was quite rightly removed.

<user_id=Miradre>
The views of political advocacy groups are of course not prohibited in WP. As a notable view in this area it should be included.

<user_id=Maunus>
You did not use it to source ""views"" but to support ""facts"" that is obviously not a correct use for such a source.

<user_id=Miradre>
Reports from various advocacy groups often include research which is allowed in Wikipedia. We should make attribution clearer and state when a view regarding public policy is stated (although this was already done but maybe it could be clearer) and when it is reporting official statistics and scientific studies in this area.

<user_id=Maunus>
I don't think so.

<user_id=Miradre>
Why not?

<user_id=Maunus>
Because we need to establish mainstream views in the article before we include fringe ones.

<user_id=Miradre>
How is for example a figure regarding the risk of being in prison, based on official statistics, a fringe view?

<user_id=Maunus>
It is not but advocacy groups are not trustworthy sources for statistical data. If you want to include the data get it from the original source or from a mainstream summary of it. We also don't use David irving's figures as the main source for numbers of holocaust victims.

<user_id=Miradre>
Godwin's law. There is nothing prohibiting research from think-thanks and so on in Wikipedia. Yes, the attribution should be clearer, stating that this is NCF calculations based on official data, but otherwise I see no reason for excluding it.

<user_id=Maunus>
I don't honestly care what kinds of reasons you see. Get a consensus without me and you can include it.

<user_id=Miradre>
Wait, you are objecting regardless of reasons? It is a case of Wikipedia:I just don't like it?

<user_id=Maunus>
No it is a case of you not seeing any kind of reason in general, for which reason I don't need to take your ""lack of seeing a reason"" seriously. I am providing reasons - you don't see them. And then you say that its a case of IDON*TLIKEIT - more like a case of IDIDNTHEARIT from your side.

<user_id=Miradre>
You did provide some reasons but they did not follow policy. Research from think-thanks, interest groups, and so on are not prohibited in Wikipedia. Maybe you should take a look at what you argue against. Have a look:

<user_id=Maunus>
I am not trying to ""censor"" your precious ""white nationalist"" viewpoint, but I am arguing that it is not a reliable source for statistics. And I am not the only one. Get a better source for the statistics. Write up a proposal for how you want to include the ""view"" of New Century Foundation then we can discuss that.

<user_id=Miradre>
Again, there is no difference between them presenting a research figure or simply presenting a policy view. Obviously there should be attribution but there is no prohibition against ""numbers"" from such groups. If you agree on that I can certainly propose a text.

<user_id=Maunus>
Again you IDIDN*THEARTHAT. Take it to the RS noticeboard.

<user_id=Miradre>
Maybe I will. But lets try to resolve it here. Do you have a Wikipedia policy page that prohibits research numbers from think-thinks, special interest groups, and so on?

<user_id=Miradre>
Anyway, I am not going to argue for this anymore. There are other sources for the data and arguments. They should be less susceptible to being rejected simply because of the authors so I will use them instead. Some already added.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Source Reliability**: The core of the argument revolves around whether ""The Color of Crime"" report by the New Century Foundation is a reliable source. User Miradre argues that the report is notable and widely cited, using official statistics and scientific literature. User Maunus counters that the source is from a political advocacy group and does not meet Wikipedia's standards for reliable sources or academic standards.

2. **Wikipedia Policies**: Both parties reference Wikipedia policies to support their arguments. User Miradre invokes WP:NPOV (Neutral Point of View) to argue for the inclusion of the report as a notable view. User Maunus references WP:RS (Reliable Sources) to argue against the use of the report to support facts.

3. **Use of Advocacy Group Research**: User Miradre suggests that research from advocacy groups is not prohibited on Wikipedia and that proper attribution can be made to clarify the source of the data. User Maunus maintains that advocacy groups are not trustworthy sources for statistical data and that mainstream sources should be used instead.

4. **Consensus and Resolution**: User Maunus suggests that a consensus should be reached without their involvement and that a better source for the statistics should be found. User Miradre eventually concedes that there are other sources for the data and arguments that may be less controversial.

5. **Argument Quality**: The discussion shows a back-and-forth where both users are somewhat entrenched in their positions. User Miradre attempts to argue for inclusion based on notability and the use of official statistics, while User Maunus emphasizes the importance of source quality and adherence to Wikipedia's standards. The dialogue includes some logical reasoning but also displays a degree of frustration and a lack of willingness to engage with the opposing viewpoint, as seen in the use of phrases like ""Godwin's law"" and ""I don't honestly care.""

6. **Resolution and Progress**: The discussion ends with User Miradre deciding to seek alternative sources, which indicates a move towards a resolution that could improve the article's quality by relying on less controversial sources.

Overall, the discussion quality is moderate. Both parties present valid points regarding Wikipedia's policies and the use of sources, but the conversation is somewhat circular and lacks a constructive resolution until the end. The participants could have improved the quality by focusing more on finding common ground and less on dismissing each other's arguments.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Reverted Changes

<user_id=Dijares>
Info was updated a few months ago to reflect the new members of RATT. User Sabbatino reverted all changes with the comment, ""Last good version."" This is someone's opinion and should not be instituted within Wikipedia. I reverted his changes to reflect the facts. November 28, 2016.

<user_id=Dijares>
''""This was discussed on multiple occasions""'''  Legally this is the version of RATT and should be reflected. Your discussion took place nearly a year ago and since then the band received legal allowance to tour as RATT and is considered RATT.  It does not matter that you consider it to not to be. Legally it is. And it is part of RATT's history, whether people agree with it or not. '''""As I see that you're a new user, I advise you to get familiar with Wikipedia's policies before editing, adding or removing content.""''' I have been using and editing within Wikipedia for going on 9 years now (no, not on a regular basis). However, I am well aware of the fact that content is not to be edited based on people's opinions. It is to show the facts. And, in your '''opinion''' the 2014 version was the last '''stable''' version of RATT, which is your opinion. Not fact. What I input is the history of RATT, and the current members (Bobby Blotzer, Joshua Alan, Mitch Perry, Brad Lang, and Stacey Blades) cannot be erased from the history. True, there are still legal proceedings, but it does not matter as this is still part of fact and history and should be documented as such. You removed ALL legal references I had input to legally back up why all changes should be made. I had all of the information with the legal proceedings. And you removed all of this. This is ALL part of the history. Do you not agree this part of the history? You're going to arbitrarily remove the history of the last years because you don't like it? Or don't agree with it? Now THAT is against Wikipedia's policies.

<user_id=Sabbatino>
''1.'''This was discussed on multiple occasions  in the past and it was determined to leave everything as it was before the split. '''2.''' As I see that you're a new user, I advise you to get familiar with Wikipedia's policies before editing, adding or removing content. –

WTF do you mean by ""'''Legally'''"" ?  -

<user_id=Dijares>
I had all documentation within the page. Please see . On November 5, 2015, a ruling overturned Warren Demartini and his attempt to procure an injunction to prevent Ratt Owner and Ceo Bobby Blotzer from using and touring under the Ratt trademark. Since then, Bobby Blotzer was allowed to use the name RATT. Since this time they are legally considered RATT. As I stated previously, this is part of the history and cannot be just removed.

<user_id=Dijares>
I am still not seeing a response from either one of you. Would you not agree that this is what was needed to show you that the band that is currently touring and in place is RATT? And would you not agree that the updates I had in place were accurate? If I do not receive a response or input, I'm going to assume that my legal backup is proof enough that the changes were, in fact, accurate and that I can revert the page back to the correct text. Thank you.

<user_id=FlightTime>
I just asked a question. You'll need consensus before replacing your changes and this discussion so far is not consensus. Oh, please review WP:INDENT  -

<user_id=Dijares>
Yes, you did ask a question, but included ""WTF"" within that question, which was rather disrespectful. Pretty sure WP:GUIDELINES have something to say about that. Thanks for the reference to the WP:INDENT. But since I was still within the conversation in which I was replying to myself, I kept the same indent... I provided the legal documentation stating that the current lineup is the correct line up for RATT. This was decided upon in a court of law. This adheres to WP:VER, as the reference was provided to state that legal outcome. All information was kept neutral and factual, per WP:NPOV. I am not attempting to be disruptive or cause any harm. I merely stated the facts as they are and updated the page in a concise manner according to the current information as it is. I applied the updates, and there seemed to be no issues until it was converted back to the version from over a year ago, therefore basically erasing a year's worth of history for this band. I see above it is stated you wanted to wait until legal proceedings were complete, but there is no clue as to when this will happen, so the page should be updated to state what the current status is. Because people come here to find this information. And, as it stands now, the information is incorrect as it refers to the court date with DeMartini, but does not provide the outcome, therefore leading readers to believe there wasn't one, or to come to their own conclusion. This is skewed data and needs to be updated.

<user_id=FlightTime>
Well, I'm moving on, good luck with your consensus.  -

<user_id=Sabbatino>
The only reason why there is this ""hostility"" towards edits is because there used to be a user who claimed that he/she was connected to Blotzer's Ratt and always added copyvio material. But as long as there's an understanding I'm not going to revert recent changes. –

<user_id=Dijares>
''""Facebook is not necessarily a good source as most of the time it contains POV from certain party, which doesn't belong here.""''' I understand what you're saying. Unfortunately that was their only platform at that time, which is why the press release was placed there. '''""Current band's status is something similar to Great White vs. Jack Russell's Great White situation. If the reverted content is added again then it should be in the vein of Great White situation and there won't be any problems.""''' Thank you. That I can do. If you don't mind, I'm going to revert the latest version that included all the edits made by the bots and others, and all the latest references, and then will edit it to be similar to Jack Russell's Great White.

<user_id=Sabbatino>
When someone says ""legally"" it can be assumed that the person is related to the subject. Moreover, Facebook is not necessarily a good source as most of the time it contains POV from certain party, which doesn't belong here. Current band's status is something similar to Great White vs. Jack Russell's Great White situation. If the reverted content is added again then it should be in the vein of Great White situation and there won't be any problems. –

<user_id=Dijares>
Well, I reverted the changes and was in the process of editing the page to make it similar to Jack Russell's Great White, when  decided to revert the changes and then send me two messages accusing me of doing an edit war. This is ridiculous.  and I came to a consensus, and I was doing exactly as he requested, and then I'm being accused of being in an edit war? I'm going to once again revert the changes. If the changes are reverted by , I will have to report him. Everything is documented here that a consensus was made, as per WP:CONSBUILD.  even stated above that he's '''""moving on""''' and wished me good luck, and then he throws an accusation at me for starting an edit war? Wrong on all counts. And completely unprofessional. edit:

<user_id=Dijares>
Thank you, . I'm not sure who that user is that is making the claims of being connected to Blotzer (actually I do recall someone stating they were related to him, but I have no idea who that is - I am not related to him.). But  reverted my changes after you and I made the consensus, and then sent me two messages threatening to have me removed if I revert the page again. Is it at all possible that you can revert the change you made? I know this is asking a lot, and I will absolutely make the changes so the page similar to Jack Russell's Great White. After the threat, I'm afraid to do any changes, and have unfortunately had to post elsewhere for help. However, if you are able to revert the changes, I can notate that you did them. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, I understand, and will continue to pursue other means to get this resolved. Thank you again.

<user_id=Dijares>
There seems to be a misunderstanding that I'm posting this information as from my POV (as Mlpearc seemed to point out on my wall). The facts are the facts - the judgments have been made. This is not a POV issue, this is not my opinion, but actual things that have occurred (despite that others have issues with these facts - they are what they are and someone's opinion on the matter does not matter). Since there is an understandable issue with using the RATT FB page as a reference, here is another link that states that Bobby Blotzer won the case over a year ago against DeMartini to use the RATT name: . I hope this helps to better clear up the reference I mentioned above. Thank you.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Factual Accuracy**: User Dijares presents a case based on legal outcomes and provides references to support the claim that the current lineup is legally recognized as RATT. This suggests a high level of factual accuracy in their argument.

2. **Relevance**: The arguments presented by Dijares are relevant to the discussion at hand, which is the accuracy of the Wikipedia page content in reflecting the current status of the band RATT.

3. **Coherence**: The arguments made by Dijares are coherent and follow a logical structure. They explain the situation, provide evidence, and argue for the inclusion of updated information based on legal decisions.

4. **Respect for Wikipedia Policies**: Dijares references Wikipedia policies such as WP:VER (verifiability) and WP:NPOV (neutral point of view), indicating an understanding and respect for Wikipedia's content guidelines.

5. **Civility**: There is a moment of incivility when user FlightTime uses ""WTF"" in a question, which Dijares points out as disrespectful. However, the overall tone of the discussion remains focused on the content dispute rather than personal attacks.

6. **Consensus Building**: Dijares attempts to build consensus by engaging with the other users and seeking a resolution that aligns with Wikipedia's guidelines. There is a mention of reaching a consensus with user Sabbatino, which is a positive step towards resolving the dispute.

7. **Response to Counterarguments**: User Sabbatino raises concerns about the reliability of Facebook as a source and compares the situation to another band's legal issues. Dijares acknowledges these concerns and agrees to adjust the content accordingly, showing a willingness to consider counterarguments and find a middle ground.

Overall, the discussion shows a reasonable level of quality in terms of argumentation. User Dijares presents a well-argued case with evidence and a willingness to adhere to Wikipedia's policies and engage in consensus-building. The other users also contribute to the discussion, although there is less detail in their arguments. The discussion could be improved with more active engagement from all parties and a clearer path to consensus.

coffin draped in Nazi colours

<user_id=47.55.7.119>
There are issues with this claim ""His coffin was draped in the Nazi colours."" in the Death section of the article.  A video of his funeral is available on youtube, and it shows this claim to be spurious at best.  The video (seen here ) shows a red-black-white ribbon adorning his coffin with the words ""Ordensgemeinschaft der Ritterkreuzträger"" (Association of Knight's Cross Recipients). You will also see later in the video, members of his procession carrying a wreath adorned with a ribbon in the Austrian colours immediately following his medal bearer.  Seeing as there is easy misunderstanding of colours in this case to mean a military flag (as is often done at military funerals), I think it should be reworded to accurately represent the truth.

<user_id=Slightsmile>
I added an inline '''dispute tag''' in the article after ""draped in the Nazi colours"".

<user_id=Zero0000>
Note that neither the source nor our text say ""Nazi flag"".  Only ""Nazi colours"".  The ribbon adorning his coffin has the same colours as the Nazi flag. So, unless the Ordensgemeinschaft der Ritterkreuzträger had those same colours independently of the Nazi colours (which I think is highly unlikely), our text is correct. It could be improved, though.

<user_id=47.55.7.119>
The issue is with the wording, not with the combination of different tinctures.  ""Colours"" in a military context means a specific type of flag, saying his casket was draped in Nazi colours makes it sound like it was draped in a flag like one usually sees at a military funeral. Since the Association's ribbon takes their colours from the order's ribbon, it's slightly ludicrous to tie it to the swastika flag instead of the association it specifically states the ribbon represents. Note that the Knight's Cross was ""denazified"" after the war but maintained the same ribbon, to say they are the ""nazi colours"" is to conflate very different things. Would Feldgrau not also be a ""nazi colour""?  Would someone wearing a black suit be said to wear the SS colour?

<user_id=47.55.7.119>
The source also says in the same sentence that he was buried by his comrades, but the video clearly shows young students from his former Studentenverbindung being the pallbearers.  It's fairly safe to say that this was journalistic creative writing rather than actual research into his funeral, since it only has one sentence in the whole article about it.

<user_id=ChartreuxCat>
I agree the wording is a bit odd, especially since the colours used were the same colours used by the Kaiserreich. Maybe colours should be changed to ""flag"". I'm aware that colours is often used to mean ""flag"" by native english speakers, but english wikipedia is used by the whole world, especially because he english wikipedia is the most neutral one. I'm sure many who read this think ""nazi colours"" means ""black/white/red"" which leads to misinformation.
While i'm at it. I'm a bit confused about using privately owned pictures on wikipedia. A relative of mine was attending Otto Skorzeny's funeral and i inherited these, many of the pictures show the coffin and flag used in colour. I'd be happy to provide one of those pictures to the article to help if it's possible. Thanks in advance

<user_id=47.55.7.119>
Was it an actual flag or a ribbon on the coffin in the photos you have? The video I linked to only shows a ribbon with the aforementioned inscription.

<user_id=47.55.7.119>
As for using your own pictures, see Wikipedia:Image use policy.  I'm sure your photos would be welcome and a useful addition to the article.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User 47.55.7.119 raises a concern about the accuracy of the statement ""His coffin was draped in the Nazi colours."" They provide evidence from a YouTube video of the funeral, which shows a ribbon with the colors red, black, and white, and the words ""Ordensgemeinschaft der Ritterkreuzträger"" (Association of Knight's Cross Recipients). This user argues that the term ""colours"" in a military context usually refers to a flag and that the association's ribbon should not be conflated with the Nazi flag.

2. User Slightsmile responds by adding a dispute tag to the article, which is a neutral action that does not contribute to the argument but acknowledges the presence of a dispute.

3. User Zero0000 points out that the source and the text do not specifically mention a ""Nazi flag,"" but rather ""Nazi colours."" They suggest that the text is technically correct since the ribbon's colors match those of the Nazi flag. However, they also acknowledge that the text could be improved for clarity.

4. User 47.55.7.119 continues the argument by emphasizing the difference between the term ""colours"" in a military context and the actual colors of the ribbon. They also mention that the Knight's Cross was ""denazified"" post-war but retained the same ribbon colors, arguing that calling them ""Nazi colours"" is misleading.

5. User ChartreuxCat agrees that the wording is odd and suggests changing ""colours"" to ""flag"" for clarity. They also raise the point that the colors black, white, and red were used by the Kaiserreich, which predates the Nazi era. This user offers to contribute personal photographs to the article for better illustration and asks for guidance on how to do so.

6. User 47.55.7.119 asks for clarification about the nature of the item on the coffin in the photographs and provides information on Wikipedia's image use policy to ChartreuxCat.

Overall, the discussion is focused on the accuracy and clarity of the information presented in the article. The participants provide evidence, ask clarifying questions, and suggest improvements. There is a clear effort to distinguish between historical facts and potential misinterpretations. The dialogue is constructive, with users building on each other's points and working towards a resolution.

"<user_id=Mootros>
Article Name

<user_id=Mootros>
There was no Germany before of 1871.

<user_id=Rjensen>
False. the RS (Reliable Sources) write about Germany before 1871. (Fuhrmann and Reuter, ''Germany in the High Middle Ages: c.1050-1200'' (1986); Arnold, ''Medieval Germany, 500-1300'' (1998); Reinhardt, ''Germany: 2000 Years'' (1961)) It's an issue of  names and some historians indeed use ""Kingdom of Germany"" re the medieval country. Look at John Gillingham, ''The Kingdom of Germany in the High Middle Ages (900–1200)'' Historical Association Pamphlets, General Series, no. 77. London: Historical Association, 1971.

<user_id=Mootros>
Not a widely established view among historians. The original Latin name does not say Germany either. Misses the point of the article because it does not really refer to such a construct called ""Germany"". There is nothing wrong to mention that some historians use this name, but it's not enough to name the article after this.

<user_id=Mootros>
This article is not about a concept by a minority of English speaking historians, but about an area ruled by several members of different dynasties that was referred to as rex teutonicorum, or king of the Germans.

<user_id=Rjensen>
Mootros lacks RS in English for his plan to change the usual title to ""Regnum teutonicum"". Amazon.com lists only one book containing the title ""Regnum teutonicum"" and it's in German.  Amazon list only ONE English language book that uses the words ""Regnum teutonicum"" somewhere in the text -[''The Medieval Empire in Central Europe'' by Herbert Schutzhe also uses the term ""German kingdom""]. The point is that Latin term is VERY rarely used in English. In common scholarly usage we have thousands of cites to '''""German Kingdom""''' (as in ''Henry IV of Germany 1056-1106'' by by I. S. Robinson 2003)and indeed in many British books going back to Freeman and Bryce a century+ ago...and today by leading writers such as Imanuel Geiss (1997), Pierre Riché - 1993, The Oxford history of medieval Europe (1993), Eric Goldberg - 2006, Andreas Dorpalen - 1985, Kurt Aland - 1986, Angus MacKay, David Ditchburn - 1997 etc etc.  So perhaps as a compromise we can suggest ""German Kingdom"" as a title.

<user_id=Mootros>
The suggestion by Rjensen makes much more sense! '''German Kingdoms''' possibly. The current title is utterly confusing and bias towards a minority of who retrofit previous events and concepts into current way of thinking. Before the Enlightenment a king ruled over people and not over a land. Hence the very name ""King of the Germans"". People in Europe generally thought of themselves as custodians of the land that belonged to god. Hence definitely not (king of) Germany.

<user_id=Pmanderson>
This contemporary account of Crecy uses ''rex Franciae'' and ''rex Boemiae''. The Kingdom of ''England'' is much older, attested of Henry I. Kings of peoples did of course exist in the Dark Ages; but Philip VI of France is not the beneficiary of the Enlightenment - by about four centuries.

<user_id=Mootros>
...by Thomas Wright 1859 referring to text of unknown author. How does this relate to a world view in the place that came to be known as Germany.

<user_id=Pmanderson>
Wright is an editor; and John of Bridlington may be obscure, but he is not unknown.

<user_id=MacX85>
Well, late medieval source speak of a kingdom ""Germania"" and a title of the emperor from Maximilian I. was ""rex Germaniae"" which literally means ""king of Germania"" or Germany. So why can't you speak of a ""kingdom of Germany"" if contemporaries can?

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. <user_id=Mootros> begins the discussion by stating that there was no Germany before 1871, which is a position that can be debated depending on the historical context and the definition of ""Germany"" being used.

2. <user_id=Rjensen> counters with references to reliable sources that discuss Germany in a historical context before 1871, suggesting that historians do use the term ""Kingdom of Germany"" to refer to the medieval country. This argument is supported by citations and references to scholarly work, which adds credibility to the claim.

3. <user_id=Mootros> responds by questioning the prevalence of the view among historians and points out that the original Latin name does not say Germany. This argument is more about the semantics of the term ""Germany"" and the interpretation of historical names, which is a valid point in historical discussions.

4. <user_id=Mootros> further clarifies their position by explaining that the article is about an area ruled by different dynasties referred to as ""rex teutonicorum"" or king of the Germans, which is a specific historical term.

5. <user_id=Rjensen> provides evidence that the term ""Regnum teutonicum"" is rarely used in English and that the term ""German Kingdom"" is more commonly found in scholarly works. This argument is based on the usage of terms in academic literature and the availability of sources in English, which is relevant for an English-language encyclopedia.

6. <user_id=Mootros> agrees with the suggestion of ""German Kingdoms"" as a compromise, acknowledging that the current title may be confusing and biased. This shows a willingness to find a middle ground based on the discussion.

7. <user_id=Pmanderson> introduces a historical example using terms like ""rex Franciae"" and ""rex Boemiae"" to illustrate that the concept of a kingdom named after a people is not a product of the Enlightenment. This adds historical context to the discussion.

8. <user_id=Mootros> questions the relevance of the example provided by Pmanderson, which is a fair point if the example does not directly relate to the concept of a German kingdom.

9. <user_id=Pmanderson> clarifies the source of the example, indicating that it is from a credible editor and not an unknown author.

10. <user_id=MacX85> brings in additional historical evidence that the term ""rex Germaniae"" was used, which supports the argument for the existence of a ""kingdom of Germany"" in historical texts.

Overall, the discussion involves a mix of historical evidence, interpretation of terms, and a search for consensus on the appropriate naming for a historical concept. The participants use citations, reference historical texts, and engage in a back-and-forth that is focused on the topic. There is a clear effort to understand each other's points and to find a solution that is historically accurate and clear for readers.

Continuing on this discussion with the removal of content in the lead over the last 24 hours. The argument about the writers of this song is well discussed and sourced in the writers section. The lead is used to summarise an article of which this is part of it, so it makes sense to include a mention of it. There is hidden text in the article that states ''""Stop! DO NOT remove the following sourced information without first contributing to the discussion on this talk page""''. Unless someone can give a valid reason why sourced content should be ignored and a comment about it removed from the lead, then I feel it should be included.

<user_id=124.106.139.19>
The hidden text has been removed and restore so many times, this is enough to make it clear that currently there is no consensus for inclusion. Therefore, the burden is on those who want to include it to gain consensus. The article should remain in the stable state prior to the inclusion of the hidden text, until such time as consensus is gained, this is in accordance with BRD.

<user_id=NZ Footballs Conscience>
That's not how it works, the information is sourced which is why it is included as the lead is suppose to summarise the article. Just because it's controversial doesn't mean we removed WP:NOTCENSOR. BRD works in that you've now removed it, I've reverted you so give a reason why it shouldn't include sourced information?

<user_id=124.106.139.19>
Oh dear. You really think that's how Wikipedia works? Just because some content is supported by a source, you can't remove it otherwise it's censoring Wikipedia? Please tell me that isn't what you're trying to say. Erm...no that isn't how BRD works - changes are made (the content was added) - That's the B of BRD - it's being Bold. Then it got reverted, which is obviously the R - then the D is the discussion. If the discussion does not gain consensus for the new content, then the article goes back to a previously stable version.
BRD works in that you've now removed it, I've reverted you so give a reason why it shouldn't include sourced information? Sorry, that's just funny. No, buddy - that isn't BRD.
Also if you think I'm the same person as MAXXII12, then go file an SPI report.

<user_id=NZ Footballs Conscience>
Well, information is in there as per MOS:INTRO ''The lead section should briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article''. So seeing as we have a whole section in the article dedicated to writers of the song it makes sense to be in the lead. If you feel it should be removed, maybe you can file a WP:DRN to get other thoughts.

Oh and file an SPI report if you think that I'm MAXXII12, if you make any further accusations about me using a sock IP, then I will file a report against you for making personal attacks.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User NZ Footballs Conscience argues for the inclusion of content in the lead section of an article based on the Wikipedia Manual of Style guideline that the lead should summarize the most important points of the article. They point out that there is a dedicated section in the article about the writers of the song, which justifies its mention in the lead. This argument is based on Wikipedia's content guidelines and is a valid point in the context of how Wikipedia articles are generally structured.

2. User 124.106.139.19 counters by emphasizing the need for consensus before including disputed content, referencing the Bold, Revert, Discuss (BRD) cycle. They argue that the article should remain in a stable state prior to the inclusion of the disputed content until consensus is reached. This argument is procedural and reflects Wikipedia's emphasis on consensus-building.

3. User NZ Footballs Conscience responds by reiterating their point about the lead summarizing the article and suggests that if there is a dispute, a Dispute Resolution Noticeboard (DRN) could be used to get more opinions. This shows an understanding of Wikipedia's dispute resolution processes.

4. User 124.106.139.19 insists that the burden of gaining consensus for the inclusion of the content lies with the user who wants to include it. They also warn against personal attacks, which is a valid concern in maintaining a civil discussion environment on Wikipedia.

Both users present arguments that are relevant to Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. User NZ Footballs Conscience focuses on content guidelines, while User 124.106.139.19 emphasizes procedural guidelines and consensus. The discussion, however, lacks a constructive back-and-forth exchange that could lead to a resolution. Instead, it seems to be at a standstill with both parties reiterating their points without much progression towards a compromise or a clear path forward.

The quality of the arguments is average. Both parties are using Wikipedia's guidelines to support their positions, but there is a lack of constructive engagement that would lead to a resolution. The discussion is somewhat circular, with each user repeating their stance without addressing the other's concerns in a way that moves towards consensus.

Some recollection

<user_id=MakeSense64>
As another editor pointed out already. The discussion is beyond silly.
Last week Zac was putting Ophiuchus (astrology) up for deletion, arguing that there shouldn't be an article about it.
Now that the article was kept, it is not enough to have an article about it, Zac insists that two other articles need sections about it. A hatnote link to Ophiuchus (astrology) is not sufficient. Does this editor know what he wants?
The difference between the ""astronomical zodiac"" and ""astrological zodiac"" is clearly explained in Zodiac, and is equal to the definition that  just brought from another source.
Ophiuchus is one of the 88 modern constellations, and that's all. And astronomers are not confused about it.
Whatever mumbo-jumbo some astrologers have dreamt up about Ophiuchus has its own space in Ophiuchus (astrology). The astrology of Ophiuchus is not that notable, it is only a rather recent fringe theory within astrology. So it is more than enough to link it from the hatnote here. It is not that important that it needs sections in several other articles.

<user_id=MakeSense64>
Note to Zac: The way you are cutting up people's responses with line by line replies, is completely unreadable. Maybe that's the purpose?

<user_id=Zachariel>
Sorry if my replies were not clear enough - let me restate the situation here, so my points are perfectly lucid.
There is no difference between the ""astronomical zodiac"" and ""astrological zodiac"" - these are one and the same. As soon as you use the word 'zodiac' you are talking about the division of celestial longitude into twelve equal divisions of 30° each. You can talk about constellations that ''cross'' the zodiac, but you cannot talk about constellations that ''make'' the zodiac because the zodiac is only made of mathematical divisions, which begin with the first point of Aries. It is therefore not an ''astrological'' discussion to explain how many signs of the zodiac there are, and why Ophiuchus is not one of these. This matter does not need reference to an astrological section or an astrological page, because it is a matter of astronomical definition, and has been so for over 2500 years. Whether astronomers are confused or not, the general public are, and so will expect this page to give some kind of reliable explanation. The content that covers this issue is brief, reliable and factual and - although this has escaped your notice - does not make any astrological reference. (As a reminder, it reads as follows:)
Because of the partial overlap of the constellation Ophiuchus and the Sun's path upon which zodiacal longitude is based, Ophiuchus is sometimes mistakenly referred to as the '13th sign of the zodiac'. This is an innapropriate reference since the zodiac is a division of the ecliptic into twelve equal parts, initially originated for calendrical purposes. This makes the notion of a '13th sign' a mathematical impossibility. It is only correct to refer to Ophiuchus as one of the constellations which cross the zodiac; which does not constitute a zodiacal sign, of which all historical records acknowledge only twelve.[16]

<user_id=MakeSense64>
The lede on Zodiac disagrees with you. Quoting:
'In astronomy , the zodiac (Greek: ζῳδιακός, zōdiakos) is the ring of constellations that lines the ecliptic, which is the apparent path of the Sun across the celestial sphere over the course of the year. The paths of the Moon and planets also lie roughly within the ecliptic, and so are also within the constellations of the zodiac.''
'In astrology, the zodiac denotes those signs that divide the ecliptic into twelve equal zones of celestial longitude.''
So in astronomy it is the ring of '''constellations''', the 13 of them, including Ophiuchus.
While in astrology it is the '''signs''' dividing the ecliptic in 12 equal zones.
Like it or not, a clear distinction is being made. And the same distinction is made in the source that  cited.
Also note that Zodiac is one of the few articles that belongs both to astronomy and astrology category.
The section you want to bring in is completely astrological, because it clearly refers to zodiac in the astrological sense of 12 equal divisions.
Astrological considerations about the ""sign"" are irrelevant here because the article starts by saying ""This article is about the constellation"".
What is it you don't understand about that?

<user_id=Zachariel>
The lede of the zodiac article is completely wrong in its opening definition. Unreferenced I note. I will add a citation request and request that the lede is corrected.

<user_id=MakeSense64>
Let me point out that the word ""zodiac"" was not used in this article, until you brought in the astrology section. In the last sentence before your new section Ophiuchus is said to be a ""zodiacal constellation"" which gives an internal link to the section that explains the difference between ""constellation"" and ""zodiacal sign"" more than sufficiently. That makes your section redundant information here.

<user_id=Acabashi>
(It's not essential to add citations to a lede, as what is there will be covered, explained and, most importantly, verified by reference further down. The lede sets out the article's salient points, per WP:MOS. If something in the lede is not mentioned and explained in the article it should be removed until it is, and the lede accordingly recast. The pertinence of additions is a different matter of course. A good place for you to add citations needed in the Zodiac article would be the 22 paragraphs that are in severe need of them)

<user_id=Zachariel>
Yes, I can see that the page is another in need of attention.  I've made a proposal on the talk page and want to give contributing editors an oportunity to open discussion on the problems. Next week I'll propose a suggestion if no one else does that first.

<user_id=Enric Naval>
(outside opinion, I spotted this at the COI noticeboard) Ophiuchus (astrology) is a WP:SPINOUT from this article, but the section should be much smaller, and it needs to put more weight in astronomic terms. Detailed debunking belongs to the astrology article.

<user_id=Jc3s5h>
I have restated JHunterJ's version to use well-defined astronomical terms. JHunterJ's version was unclear because
There is no official definition of ""zodiacal longitude"".
If we take ""zodiacal longitude"" to mean celestial longitude, then every celestial object and constellation has a (range of) celestial longitude, so the statement becomes meaningless.

<user_id=Jc3s5h>
As far as I can tell, modern astronomers no longer offer precise definitions of ""sign of the zodiac"", and various media use the term in many different ways. Thus, the term is not well enough defined to decide of it is a mistake to describe Ophiuchus as the 13th sign of the zodiac.

<user_id=Zachariel>
Jc3s5h, I have undone your edit because it presents the information falsely.  The previous definition was too brief in my opinion but at least it wasn't inaccurate. The zodiac is an ecliptic-based frame of astronomical refrence that is used to define celestial latitude and longitude.  What you have written above shows misunderstanding and lack of knowledge so  if you want to propose an amendment based on sources, it would be a good idea to discuss here first with details of the sources for verification.  Please present a page number and not just a book so we can see why you are making the assumptions you are making.  It is my intention to correct the information on the zodiac page, BTW, before worrying too much about what this page says, but what is presented here should not be deliberately false or misleading.

<user_id=Jc3s5h>
It is time for dispute resolution.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Understanding of the Subject**: The participants demonstrate a deep understanding of the subject matter, discussing the differences between the astronomical and astrological zodiac, the definition of zodiacal signs, and the role of the constellation Ophiuchus. This indicates a high level of expertise and knowledge, which is a positive aspect of the discussion quality.

2. **Clarity of Arguments**: The arguments presented by <user_id=MakeSense64> and <user_id=Zachariel> are clear and articulate their points well. They both provide explanations for their positions, though they disagree on the interpretation of the zodiac and the inclusion of Ophiuchus. The clarity of their arguments contributes positively to the discussion quality.

3. **Use of Evidence**: Both users attempt to use evidence to support their claims, such as referencing the lead of the zodiac article and discussing the historical context of the zodiac's definition. However, there is a dispute over the accuracy and interpretation of this evidence, which affects the quality of the discussion.

4. **Respectful Discourse**: The discussion remains mostly respectful, although there is a hint of frustration in some responses. For example, <user_id=MakeSense64> criticizes <user_id=Zachariel>'s method of replying, which could be seen as a minor lapse in maintaining a completely respectful tone. Nonetheless, the overall tone is focused on the content rather than personal attacks.

5. **Constructive Proposals**: <user_id=Zachariel> proposes to correct the information on the zodiac page and invites further discussion, which is a constructive approach. <user_id=Jc3s5h> suggests dispute resolution, which is also a constructive step towards resolving the disagreement.

6. **Redundancy and Relevance**: There is some redundancy in the arguments, with <user_id=MakeSense64> and <user_id=Zachariel> reiterating their positions multiple times without much progression towards a resolution. This repetition slightly lowers the quality of the discussion.

7. **Engagement with Counterarguments**: The participants engage with each other's counterarguments to some extent, but there are moments where they talk past each other rather than directly addressing the points made. This could be improved for a more productive discussion.

Overall, the discussion is detailed and demonstrates a high level of expertise, but it is marred by some redundancy and a lack of progression towards a resolution. The participants use evidence and maintain a mostly respectful tone, which are positive aspects. However, the disagreement over interpretations and the need for clearer engagement with counterarguments slightly reduce the quality.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

The title is a made-up term of Antidiskriminator.
Knjiga o Kosovu isn't RS:
by  Jasna Dragović)
Despite its relative backwardness and isolation, Kosovo’s status as a focus  for Serbian nationalism and flash point for armed conflict has generated a large literature describing the region’s history. The Kosovo problem is evoked from a Serbian perspective in Dimitrije Bogdanović, Knijga o Kosovu.
author of a very influential study called Knjiga o Kosovu, which was published among the numerous revisionist writings of 1985 was Dimitrije Bogdanovic
Bogdan Popovic was a conservative politician and essayist of the interbellum period in Serbia i.e not RS.
Milosevic's propaganda newspaper isn't RS. Btw the article constantly explains to the reader the ''national rights'' of Serbia.
As no part of that area was ever ceded to Serbia there is no territorial succession.

<user_id=Antidiskriminator>
The title of the artcle is defined according to ""Wikipedia:Naming conventions. ''""An otherwise notable topic has not yet received much attention in the English-speaking world... If this happens, follow the conventions of the language in which this entity is most often talked about""''.
Will you please provide link to the RSN which defined Knjiga o Kosovu as non-rs. Btw, the links you provided talk about authors opinion about Kosovo, not Durres or Durres County.
Will you please provide a link to the policy which support your claim that conservative politicians and esseyists of the interbellum period in Serbia are not RS? Or to RSN which support such claim?
The text written by contemporary historian Čedomir Antić is published in Večernje novosti in 2010, four years after Milošević died and ten years after he lost all his power.
The word ""ceded"" is not used in the article. On the contrary, it is clearly emphasized that this county was established "" on the part of the territory of Albania occupied from Ottoman Empire during the First Balkan War.""
Taking above mentioned in consideration, there are no POV issues proven or disputes, so please remove tags you added to this article.

<user_id=ZjarriRrethues>
This is not a subject that hasn't received ''much'' attention, but nobody has ever even documented it as an event. Even in Yugoslav works the Slavic translation appears only once in Knjiga o Kosovu. Please stick to RS and NPOV i.e you can't write an article about the activities of the Serbian army and use only Serbian dubious sources by authors, which are labeled as nationalists/revisionists etc. by everyone else. Btw you have only one sources mentioning the phrase, however, as there's no documentation in English you shouldn't translate Okrug to match the English translation of the modern county. 

<user_id=Antidiskriminator>
I still can conclude that I was right when I wrote that there are no POV issues proven or any disputes of factual accuracy. Please remove tags you added to this article.

<user_id=ZjarriRrethues>
In order to remove the tags I'll have to remove most of the article's content. That being said the topic exists only in wikipedia and isn't documented at all anywhere else. At the very most there's a sentence in the partisan work Knjiga o Kosovu about this okrug. Btw the infobox will go too, because there was no intermediate rule between Ottoman Empire and independent Albania. 

<user_id=Gaius Claudius Nero>
Since the name had to be made up by Antid, it's clear that there is no such thing as a Serbian Durres County. As far as I can tell, Durres was just part of an occupied zone, much like northern Iraq was occupied by the Americans where they set up their own governors (Jay Garner) and the Americans claimed that Iraqis were celebrating their occupation by a foreign country. The parallels aren't absolute but it would be ridiculous to claim that northern Iraq is/was the 51st American state.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. <user_id=ZjarriRrethues> argues that the term ""Serbian Durres County"" is not well-documented and that the sources being used to support the existence of such an entity are not reliable. They mention that the term appears only once in a work called ""Knjiga o Kosovu"" and that the sources are considered nationalist/revisionist by others.

2. <user_id=Antidiskriminator> defends the use of the term based on Wikipedia's naming conventions, arguing that the entity is most often talked about in a certain language and that the sources used are valid. They also clarify that the article does not claim the territory was ""ceded"" to Serbia, but rather that it was established on occupied territory during the First Balkan War.

3. <user_id=ZjarriRrethues> insists that the topic is not documented outside of Wikipedia and that the article's content is not supported by reliable sources. They suggest that most of the article's content and the infobox should be removed due to the lack of documentation.

4. <user_id=Gaius Claudius Nero> provides an analogy with the American occupation of northern Iraq to argue that just because an area is occupied and administered by a foreign power does not mean it should be recognized as an official part of that foreign power's territory.

The quality of the arguments varies. <user_id=ZjarriRrethues> provides a strong argument about the lack of reliable sources and the importance of adhering to documented history. <user_id=Antidiskriminator> attempts to justify the use of certain sources and naming conventions but does not address the core issue of the lack of widespread recognition or documentation of the term ""Serbian Durres County."" <user_id=Gaius Claudius Nero> introduces an analogy to support the argument against recognizing the term, which adds a different perspective to the discussion.

Overall, the discussion shows engagement with Wikipedia's policies and an attempt to grapple with the complexities of historical documentation and naming conventions. However, the arguments could benefit from more direct evidence and a clearer consensus on what constitutes a reliable source in this context.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.",6.0

Big Show VS. Shaq

<user_id=92.237.180.75>
WWE not confirmed this match is happening. Nothing should be added until the WWE themselves has offically confirmed it.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=Dane>
This is clearly notable as it has verifiable reliable sources reporting on it.

<user_id=WarMachineWildThing>
''DONE'''

<user_id=JDC808>
Verifiable sources are reporting on the possibility of the match. They have not confirmed it. If those sources ''confirmed'' it, then WWE would have also already confirmed it. WWE has not confirmed it yet. They have only teased it.

<user_id=Dane>
- Followed by the social media on Shaq's official accounts as reported by FOX Sports, the match is going ahead.  The third party reliable sources says it's a go - so it should be included until a reliable source says otherwise.  We do not need official confirmation from WWE (which would be a primary source).

<user_id=JDC808>
Actually, no, those sources '''have not''' said it's a go. At best, they say it ""looks"" to be happening. That's not a confirmation. That's speculation. Again, if those sources did in fact confirm it, WWE would have also confirmed it. And we actually do need confirmation from WWE because they can change their minds. It's their show after all.

<user_id=Dane>
By that standard we could change half of the Wikipedia articles because things ''could'' go another direction. We use what the sources unrelated to the event say.  In the current source, it states very clearly that Shaq accepted the match and that Shaq has said he is coming for Big Show at WrestleMania 33.  The title of the article itself is a confirmation: .

<user_id=JDC808>
He can accept the match all he wants, but that doesn't mean it's going to happen. Big Show in an interview in November (after the ESPYs where Shaq ""accepted"") said it ''could'' happen, but did not say it would. Real talk, I know the match is going to happen, but we can't say that until there is an actual confirmation. WWE themselves shared that Instagram post of Shaq working out, but guess what they said? They said ""will it happen"", not ""it's going to happen"". The only matches confirmed for the card are Goldberg vs Lesnar and Orton's WWE Championship match.

<user_id=TheDeviantPro>
Took a look at the sources that provided from Sky Sports and Fox Sports and it looks like it's mostly teasing the possibility that the match will happen, none of it definitively confirms the match. But in the end WrestleMania 33 is a WWE event, and like JDC808 said, WWE have only confirmed two matches on the card and none of the matches are Big Show vs. Shaq. WWE most likely announced the match closer to WrestleMania, but for now we should only included the matches that has been confirmed by the WWE.

<user_id=WarMachineWildThing>
So we are ignoring policy and vaild refrences,Got it. Perfect reason why I'm retiring and is why Wiki is so screwed up. One second it's a vaild reference but the next its not. By the reasons above every wresting article needs to have facelifts and any source NOT WWE needs to be removed. Those refrences are third party reliable sources and say it's a go - so it should be included until a reliable source says otherwise. We do not need official confirmation from WWE (which would be a primary source). This whole thing is a perfect example of we only follow policy when it's convenient.

<user_id=TheDeviantPro>
No we are not ignoring policy or valid references. The problem with Sky Sports and Fox Sports sources that they don't know if the match is happening and that they teasing the possibility of the match. The first source says the tweets '''suggests''' the match will take place on April 2, but other then that, it doesn't really confirms anything. The second source says the match has been '''tentatively''' on the card (""tentatively"" means not definitely), therefore the match is not yet confirmed. In the end we need sources that actually confirms the match. Tweets and photos of them on Twitter and Instagram, trash talking each other and teasing a match at WrestleMania, doesn't confirm the match is happening.

<user_id=JDC808>
Pinging you in case you didn't see TheDeviantPro's response. What Deviant said is my exact argument on the matter.

<user_id=WarMachineWildThing>
My final post on the matter, You are are ignoring policy and valid references. Fox sports broke the news about Teddy longs induction FIRST not WWE, which validates the point further. The match is happening it's been on to many sites, it's why Shaq is preparing and why Show is getting in better shape. WWE has even posted about, it's called build up to get interest. 2 vaild sources were removed which is against policy and NOTHING has been refrenced stating it wasn't happening. So the removal is Incorrect. But whatever, I'm retired.

<user_id=Sc30002001>
Add the goddamn match its been confirmed and all is ready to go we don't need WWE to publicly come out and announce it varies News sources have confimed and they showed big show getting ready!!! What the hell is wrong with you people!!!!

<user_id=JDC808>
Let me just ask you one final thing, did you actually read the sources? I'm not disputing the reliability of the sources. What I am disputing is the claim that you and  believe they have based on their click bait title. Also, it's not against policy to remove sources if those sources don't actually back what's claimed. I will quote these articles:
From Sky Sports reference
WWE powerhouse Big Show has '''''continued to tease''''' a WrestleMania showdown with basketball legend Shaquille O'Neal
Show's tweet '''''suggests''''' the bout will take place on April 2 in Orlando
From Fox Sports reference
but one of the bouts has been '''''tentatively''''' on the card since the ESPYs last summer.
Everything else in the articles are information about the two, their past encounters, Shaq ""accepting"" the match (which isn't an automatic guarantee), the back and forth tweets, and speculation. No where in those articles does it confirm that the match is happening.
Also, to follow up on Fox Sports breaking the news about Teddy's Hall of Fame induction first, I can use that exact argument against you. Every time that another news outlet other than WWE has reported something first, WWE soon after posted about it and mentioned it on TV. They have done neither in regards to this match. They have only teased the possibility of it. As I said in an earlier post, I know the match is gonna happen. It's why I've added information to the hidden paragraph in the Background section, however, I know that we don't put information unless it's confirmed.

<user_id=WarMachineWildThing>
I know what both articles say, pretty sure  has read as well. WWE would NEVER allow all this build up if it weren't true, The removal from the article was and is wrong period. We all know it's coming, vaild sources were provided, you removed them. Just like the UK title/NXT argument you continue to drag out and have with another user, your wrong. Now you just admitted you know the match is happening which is why you hid the storyline in the article. It should be removed as well hidden or not, Typical double standard bs. You then got the admin to unlock the article for you even though you are part of the dispute and involved in this talk so you could edit the article, dirty and underhanded tactics to get your way. So Don't ping me again.

<user_id=Sc30002001>
Its been confirmed by many news sources and CBS News!!! the sources and match have been added only to be undone by the likes of you.— Preceding unsigned comment added by   05:36, 14 February 2017

<user_id=Sc30002001>
I'm unsure why this match is still unlisted but the Bray Wyatt match is good to go. That seems far more ""tentative"" then the Shaq match, given that Daniel Bryan said Wyatt may not even be the champion by WrestleMania. Sourcing is better for Shaq/Show too.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The main point of contention in the discussion is whether the match between Big Show and Shaq should be included in the Wikipedia article based on the sources available at the time of the discussion. 

2. User JDC808 argues that while the match is likely to happen, it has not been officially confirmed by WWE, and therefore should not be included in the article. This user emphasizes the need for official confirmation from WWE, as they are the primary source for their own events.

3. User Dane argues that third-party reliable sources have reported on the match, and that should be sufficient to include it in the article. This user suggests that waiting for WWE's official confirmation is unnecessary.

4. User WarMachineWildThing expresses frustration with the inconsistency in applying Wikipedia's policies, arguing that reliable third-party sources have confirmed the match and that should be enough for inclusion.

5. User TheDeviantPro supports JDC808's stance, pointing out that the sources in question only suggest or tentatively report on the match, which does not equate to confirmation.

6. User Sc30002001 is adamant that the match has been confirmed by various news sources and should be included, but does not provide specific evidence to counter the points made by JDC808 and TheDeviantPro.

7. The discussion involves a mix of valid points about Wikipedia's policies on verifiability and the reliability of sources, as well as some emotional responses and accusations of policy violations.

8. The quality of the arguments varies, with some users providing clear reasoning and citing Wikipedia's policies, while others rely more on the assumption that the match will happen based on the buildup and preparation by the involved parties.

Overall, the discussion shows a reasonable level of engagement with Wikipedia's policies and the principles of verifiability and reliable sourcing. However, the discussion is somewhat marred by emotional responses and a lack of consensus on the interpretation of the available sources.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

General bias

<user_id=Magicpiano>
This article as presently written presents in significant degree only the French perspective.  What is missing is significant descriptions of diplomatic activities of the Iroquois and other native parties, especially in dealings with the English, who are only mentioned as traders. (They claimed to be guarantors of Iroquois security, but failed to do so in King William's War.) English diplomacy and frontier activity had an impact on the negotiations leading to Montreal, which is not mentioned.  (The Iroquois in 1698-1701 conducted diplomacy both in Montreal and Albany, and also concluded a significant agreement in Albany in 1701 that furthered English imperial objectives; none of this is mentioned here.)  The imperial ambitions of both England and France (claiming some sort of sovereign control over Iroquoia) is also missing. For these deficiencies of content I have reduced the assessment to Start. ''''

<user_id=Charles Edward>
You are correct, the article is missing alot of information. Your caricaturization of bias is a little incorrect though. THe English are mentioned as more than traders, but as allies of the Iroquois, and the results impacted the French much more than the English, so its only fitting to discuss that more. I think its best to look at this article in the context of the Beaver Wars - another article needing work. Please feel free to improve them both. I disagree with the downgrading to start class, it is a weak C according the assessment scale. —  | 

<user_id=Magicpiano>
Since I don't keep track of which projects use C and which don't, I tend to ignore it as an assessment.  Feel free to rate up those that use it.

<user_id=Magicpiano>
As far as the English as allies: the problem is that Iroquois politics isn't that simple.  While the Covenant Chain existed as a formal alliance, there were significant factions that were either neutral or pro-French within the league, and all of this is absent here.  I only came to this article because I've been working on Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont, the governor of MA/NH/NY 1698-1701, and was exposed to this in researching his role in frontier negotiations.  Agreed that the impact of this treaty was of greatest importance to the French and the Iroquois, but the English (in particular Bellomont) tried to stop the negotiations.  (One major reason for their failure in this was, as far as I've read, their inability to actually protect the Iroquois as promised in the Covenant Chain.)
Significantly improving the article would require more research into Iroquois politics than I'm presently prepared to do. ''''

<user_id=Mathieugp>
I think the reason for the bias is that the 300th anniversary of the ''Grande paix de Montréal'' was celebrated in Quebec in 2001. There were numerous events, several books were published, historians were interviewed, etc. The article (and the French one is more or less the same) presents the perspective our media underlined at the time.

<user_id=Charles Edward>
Perhaps I should put it this way: you have alleged bias without providing sources. I agree the article requires improvement, but I do not believe there is an inherent or purposeful bias in it. So if you are unwilling to invest the time to address your concerns, you should at least provide some evidence that they have merit. —  | 

<user_id=Magicpiano>
For a nuanced view of internal Iroquois politics and their diplomatic activities leading up to 1701, see for example:
These were my primary sources in working on this subject in the Bellomont article.
I did not state that the bias is purposeful  I merely state that it exists. Uncited statements like ""egged on as they were by the colonists of New York, who encouraged their Iroquois allies to attack the Saint Lawrence Valley"" are also problematic on their face, by the way.  The French could be said to ""egg on"" their allies, too, but this is not stated (or even suggested). ''''

<user_id=Magicpiano>
Further instances of bias:
Frontenac defeats the English at Quebec in 1690.  Why were the English at Quebec in fall 1690?  Because of three Frontenac-orchestrated attacks on the New England frontiers.  Why did those happen? (1) war declared in Europe (2) reprisal for Lachine massacre.  Why did Lachine massacre happen?  Not sure of proximate causes, but the chain clearly goes back further.  Now, you obviously don't have to present this entire context ''here'', but as presently stated the article leaves me with a strong impression that the English (and by extension the Iroquois) are the aggressors, when the history is clearly somewhat more nuanced.  (Sources: see for example Peckham, ''The Colonial Wars'', or Kingsford for Frontenac's role in the 1690 French offensive.)
The whole last paragraph of the Aftermath, while I accept its basic truth (even though it isn't cited), is relatively unvarnished French-Canadian boosterism and is not well-connected to the rest of the article.  A discussion of French strategy for dealing with North American natives vs. that of other nations would be appropriate in a background section (not the aftermath).
French followed their long-used reasonable policy - ""reasonable"" is POV
The Great Peace of Montreal is a unique diplomatic event - uncited POV
'''

<user_id=Mathieugp>
I agree. Historical shortcuts instead of historical context, promotional terms, etc.

<user_id=Mathieugp>
Sources that could surely be of interest in addition to American or British ones are Gilles Havard's ''The Great Peace of Montreal of 1701'' (preview of first 55 pages) and Alain Beaulieu's ''The Great Peace''.

<user_id=Magicpiano>
Well, I've given it a bit of a rewrite, adding some missing details and removing most of the above issues.  I ''think'' (based on a modest number of sources I looked at) that it avoids unnecessary accusations of complicity in various actions without evidence.  (No, I didn't cite anything, but I believe everything I wrote is more citable than what I removed.) ''''

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Magicpiano raises concerns about the article's bias, noting that it predominantly presents the French perspective and lacks significant descriptions of the diplomatic activities of the Iroquois and other native parties, especially in their dealings with the English. This is a valid point, as a balanced historical article should present multiple perspectives.

2. User Magicpiano also points out the absence of information regarding English diplomacy and frontier activity, which had an impact on the negotiations leading to Montreal. This is another valid criticism, as it suggests that the article is missing important historical context.

3. User Charles Edward acknowledges that the article is missing information but disputes the characterization of bias. He argues that the English are mentioned as allies of the Iroquois and that the impact of the treaty was more significant for the French, which justifies the focus. However, he does not provide specific counterexamples to the points raised by Magicpiano.

4. User Magicpiano further elaborates on the complexity of Iroquois politics and the English attempts to stop the negotiations, indicating a nuanced historical situation that the article fails to capture. This adds depth to the initial criticism and underscores the need for a more comprehensive account.

5. User Mathieugp suggests that the bias might be due to the 300th anniversary of the ""Grande paix de Montréal"" being celebrated in Quebec in 2001, which could have influenced the media's perspective at the time. This is an insightful observation that provides potential context for the bias.

6. User Magicpiano provides examples of sources for a more nuanced view of Iroquois politics, demonstrating a willingness to substantiate claims with evidence. This strengthens the argument for addressing the bias in the article.

7. User Magicpiano identifies specific instances of bias and problematic statements in the article, offering a detailed critique that further supports the need for revision.

8. User Mathieugp agrees with the critique and acknowledges the presence of historical shortcuts and promotional terms in the article.

9. User Magicpiano takes action by rewriting parts of the article to address the issues raised, showing a constructive approach to resolving the dispute.

Overall, the discussion is characterized by a constructive exchange of viewpoints, with User Magicpiano providing a well-reasoned critique supported by evidence and suggestions for improvement. User Charles Edward, while initially defensive, does not dismiss the concerns outright and remains engaged in the conversation. User Mathieugp contributes additional context and agrees with the need for revision. The discussion is focused on improving the article's historical accuracy and balance, which is a positive and productive goal.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.5",8.5

It relies largely or entirely upon a single source. - Not only is a single source in use, Richard Felix Staar, ""Foreign policies of the Soviet Union"", but this is a partisan book, published by a partisan institution.
Its neutrality is disputed. - Crealy based on a single, partisan source, makes it non-neutral. Furthermore, the list of organizations included here is unsourced and seem more like attempts to smear rather than an encyclopedic survey.
Its factual accuracy is disputed. - The term is an epithet used by political rivals, and its instances a documented phenomenon by neutral researchers are lacking. It should be trivial to find sources backing this.
It may contain previously unpublished synthesis of published material that conveys ideas not attributable to the original sources. - Since the article seems to be written in the perspective that one definition of the term, in a single source, is correct,
Its neutrality or factuality may be compromised by weasel words. - The lack of generalized neutrality is further exacerbated by the use of terms like ""totalitarian"" or "" transmogrified"" in ways that break NPOV presentation.
Its introduction provides insufficient context for those unfamiliar with the subject - The term is an epithet envogue during the McCarthy era, and while some organizations were indeed organizations controlled by communist parties, many organizations that were not communist controlled, or even were anti-communist were called by this label, both by mainstream and fringe sources. Howeve rit is presented to the reader as a technical term, rather than a political epithet born out of an specific context.
The examples and perspective in this article may not include all significant viewpoints.
This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding reliable references. - Needs not only to expand the source used, but provide a wide range of views on the subject, from different view points. This is a controversial term, and needs to be treated as such.

<user_id=Cerejota>
I would agree to a redirect and merge to a relevant article, such as McCarthyism or some such, but it is clear this term, if deleted and not salted, will bounce back into existence (as it is indeed a notable term) and I would rather ensure it is a quality contribution than have it be recreated by a partisan and having to AfD again. Another possibility is to move to Communist front (epithet) but there is no reason to disamb, so ther ecould be a good-faith effort not to that. That said, I wouldn't oppose an AfD and !v delete as it stands, because beyond notability there is precious little here to salvage as an encyclopedia article.

<user_id=Rjensen>
Communist front is a standard term in the RS and the scholarly literature, and the problems that Cerejota complains about have been largely fixed.

<user_id=Cerejota>
Communist front is a controversial term used by partisans to discredit organizations that might or might not have relationships with communist organizations. Its use in literature is not an acceptance of a validity of the term, but a study of its use.
Article issues largely remain, thinga like ""totalitarian Marxist"" are extreme violations of NPOV, the article largely follows one view on this concept etc etc etc. Even the addition of sources have not diminish the reliance in a single source for structure and argument. Notably, criticism of the use of the term is largely absent.

<user_id=Rjensen>
Carejota seems to believe the Stalinists were not totalitarian or perhaps not Marxist or somethinghe's very vague as to what his problem might be. Does he think the Communist front organizations did not exist, or perhaps they should be called something else?

<user_id=Bobfrombrockley>
I agree with Certoja that this is a far from perfect article, but it is not as bad as porrayed and certainly not worthy of deletion. Other sources are used in the article, e.g. Lynn Mally, ""Inside a Communist Front: A Post-Cold War Analysis of the New Theatre League,"" American Communist History, June 2007, Vol. 6 Issue 1, pp 65-95. Others should and could easily be added, and most of the problems could be corrected.

<user_id=Cerejota>
Cerejota is the name. What you or I believe about this topic is entirely irrelevant. What is relevant is that the use of the term ""totalitarian"" in relationship with any political movement is an expression of a partisan point of view and hence violates the principle of WP:NPOV. The non-existence of sources and points of views that refute this analysis is a violation of NPOV as per WP:UNDUE. Those things, unlike our opinions, do matter.

<user_id=Cerejota>
I have not argued for deletion, and explicitly said so in this very talk page. Since I do not have access to these sources, my only recourse is tagging.

<user_id=Rjensen>
we don't tag out of personal ignorance. The sources are mostly online at books.google.com

<user_id=Cerejota>
We do tag out of personal ignorance if no effort to relieve this ignorance is made: WP:BURDEN

<user_id=Soman>
I'd say my problems with this article is mainly with the delimitation and tone. If are going to have an article on mass organizations, then the text would need some serious re-working. The notion of 'fronts', with the conspirationalist (not sure that's a proper English word, but can't find a better at the moment, is tilted and highly paternalistic. It tries to assume that anyone associated with the communist movement would be duped by alien agents, it seeks to negate the possibility that people would embrace Marxism by their own free will. If we take an approach to communist mass work more globally (outside the scope of 1950s USA), we find that in most cases members and sympathizers of pro-communist mass organizations are: 1) well aware of the partisan links of the organization and 2) has sympathy towards the party organization.
Mass organizations should be understood in the following context: A Communist Party is, per definition, a vanguard party. To be a member of the party, you have to have a certain level of ideological formation and be willing to commit time and effort to party work. Many people, who might be sympathizers of the party, are not able/willing to assume this task. Thus the party creates mass organizations, usually along sectors (youth, students, trade unions, women, peasants, cultural associations, etc.), to which membership is open for anyone willing to join. The maximum programme of the mass organization coincides with minimum programme of the party.
That said, mass organizations are not a uniquely communist phenomenon. Could we find any source, that is not a Cold War diatribe, that actually explores this subject? The present listing has little encyclopediatic value.

<user_id=Rjensen>
the opening lede quotes Schrecker: ""Schrecker says that on the contrary, ""most of these people knowingly collaborated with the party, believing it to be the most effective ally they could find.""  Of course it's not a matter of timeit was a matter of control.  The Party exerted very firm control over its members and that intense intrusive control was hard for many to accept.  The demand for ""Passionate Commitments"" is very well made in Gerald Zahavi, ""Passionate Commitments: Race, Sex, and Communism at Schenectady General Electric, 1932-1954,"" ''Journal of American History,'' Sep 1996, Vol. 83 Issue 2, pp 514-548 in JSTOR In a nutshell, you have to love the Stasi-like surveillance to remain a party member, and at the least sign of deviation you were expelled.

<user_id=Cerejota>
Please read WP:LEDE. I have removed non-compliant material. Also I am begining to see a WP:QUOTEFARM tendency, The article is about the term ""communist front"", not its usage or examples of people using it. This goes hand in hand with WP:OR and WP:SYNTH: we must use sources to support statements made in the encyclopedic voice that are a result of the source's research. Examples of simple usage, without counter-examples are unacceptable.

<user_id=Cerejota>
I have opened a merger discussion because I tried to edit this article to a neutral state, and came up with very little that doesn't overlap with it. So a merger would both keep the term, and a section in that article, subject to WP:UNDUE limits.

<user_id=Carrite>
Mass organization redirects to ""Communist party,"" which is epically dumb. ""Communist front"" and ""Mass organization"" are close to the same meaning, one being a right wing pejorative and the other a left wing self-description. There is a flavor of difference beyond that, an element of ''intended deception.'' Some CP mass organizations were comparatively open in terms of their association to the relevant Communist Party; others were not. Both terms should point to the same article, which will be a tough one to write with balance. It is absolutely beyond question, to my mind, that the article title should be ""Mass organization"" rather than ""Communist front"" on the basis of NPOV. The latter absolutely has a pejorative context, while the former is a self-description. This seems a pretty easy call. There's a comment above that ""Communist front"" is a term that is used in the literature. That's true. So is ""Mass organization"" (I was working from a book on the early CP of Vietnam this morning published in 1982 by Cornell University Press that used the term, for example). It will be a writing challenge getting things written neutrally, but there are battleground articles all over the place at WP and this doesn't seem like anywhere near the biggest. Reason needs to prevail.

<user_id=Carrite>
With regard to the inanity of the redirect of ""Mass organization"" to ""Communist party"" — the '''whole point''' of Mass organizations/Communist fronts was that they were NOT the party and burdened by the discipline of the party. They were intended as a mechanism to build broader participation ''outside the party'' to advance policy objectives of the Communist Party, and secondarily to help the party identify and attract motivated and sympathetic people to its cause. It's a subject for an article in and of itself, completely separate from an article discussing ""Communist party.""

<user_id=Carrite>
I've been parsing the history of the ""Communist Party"" page. It seems that Soman inadvertently hijacked the article back in Dec. 2006 when he ported over some of the ""CP"" material to History of Communism, adding material on Mass Organizations in its stead. The article has been the subject of innumerable edits and much conflict since, but it's more or less the same piece. i think it needs to be blown back into some approximation of its early 2006 state, which wasn't all bad, and the ""Mass organization"" material combined with ""Communist front"" material as a new ""Mass organization"" page. My view anyway.

<user_id=Bobfrombrockley>
I've left my view at the Communist party talkpage, but wanted to add that if this article remains it needs to remove the US stuff from the lede and have a global lede and the US stuff in the US section.

<user_id=Bobfrombrockley>
I've been looking more at the article, and done some edits to try to start to address some of these issues. I think this will make the basis of a better article if it stays here, or make the material stronger if it is merged elsewhere. Obvl  iously still needs more work.

<user_id=Rjensen>
Merger = bad idea. The issue of Communist fronts has a large literature quite apart from the large literature on the Communist party. That is, the RS do not merge the topics and so Wikipedia should not do so.  A merger assumes that all Communists fronts are somehow part of the CPbut that was not true. Often a handful of Communists quietly took over an organization at the top.

<user_id=Soman>
No. If you write a lede for 'Jewish Bolshevism', basing 85% on quotes from Goebbels and Gestapo archives and then add 'the scholar X disagrees with this' in the end, then you're still not acheiving NPOV. In fact the negation of Schrecker only pushes the POV synth further, as it projects the McCarthyist as the mainstream view and the less conspiracy-theorist view as the dissident.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Source Reliability and Neutrality**: User Cerejota raises concerns about the article relying on a single, potentially biased source. This is a valid point in terms of Wikipedia's guidelines for reliable sourcing and neutrality. The argument is well-founded and suggests a need for a broader range of sources to ensure a balanced perspective.

2. **Neutrality and NPOV (Neutral Point of View)**: Several users, including Cerejota and Bobfrombrockley, discuss the importance of neutrality, particularly with terms like ""totalitarian"" and ""Marxist,"" which can be seen as partisan. The argument for maintaining a neutral point of view is consistent with Wikipedia's core content policies and is well-articulated.

3. **Factual Accuracy and Dispute**: The discussion about the factual accuracy of the term ""communist front"" and its historical context is crucial. Cerejota argues that the term is often used as an epithet and that the article should reflect a range of viewpoints. This is a strong argument for improving the article's accuracy and inclusiveness of different perspectives.

4. **Synthesis of Published Material**: The concern about potential original research or synthesis of material without proper attribution is raised by Cerejota. This is a key point in Wikipedia's content guidelines to avoid original research, and the argument is made clearly.

5. **Context and Inclusiveness**: The argument for providing sufficient context for readers unfamiliar with the subject, as well as including all significant viewpoints, is made by several users. This is an important aspect of writing an encyclopedic article, and the users present a strong case for improving the article in this regard.

6. **Merger and Article Structure**: The discussion about whether to merge the article with another or to keep it separate involves several users. Carrite's argument that ""mass organization"" and ""communist front"" should lead to the same article due to their close meanings is a reasonable suggestion for simplifying and clarifying content for readers.

7. **Research and Verification**: Rjensen's point that sources are available online and that users should research before tagging articles for issues is valid. However, the counterargument by Cerejota about the burden of proof being on those who add or maintain content is also in line with Wikipedia's verification policy.

8. **Writing Challenge and Balance**: Carrite and Soman discuss the challenge of writing a balanced article on a topic with a contentious history. The recognition of this challenge and the call for a balanced approach are strong arguments for improving the article's quality.

Overall, the discussion shows a high level of engagement with Wikipedia's content policies and a clear understanding of the importance of neutrality, reliable sourcing, and inclusiveness. The participants provide reasoned arguments and counterarguments, demonstrating a collaborative effort to improve the article's quality.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.5",8.5
"<user_id=Jpatokal>
Article name: protests, uprising or revolution?

<user_id=Jpatokal>
As I type this, the article is named ""Tunisian protests"" (9481 hits on Google News), the lead calls it the ""Tunisian uprising"" (3954) and the box calls it the ""Tunisian Revolution"" (4123).  While I think the name is shifting in favor of ""revolution"", I'm going to reset them all back to ""protests"" until we agree on a better name and the article is rewritten accordingly.

<user_id=Jpatokal>
Also, the box claims the revolution ended on 14 Jan with Ben Ali's departure, but obviously the protests didn't  it seems a little early to call an end.

<user_id=Jpatokal>
One more interesting data point: even government sources now regularly refer to a ""revolution"" . If the government and the people both think it's a revolution, then I suppose it is?

<user_id=Unused000705>
I would still call it an uprising. Google might not be best on this one. Reliable sources, like the Guardian newspaper call it an uprising. Revolution might catch up and we can change it then. An uprising just means a more wideranging movement than protests, which this is.

<user_id=Cs32en>
In my view, an uprising is characterized by an actual or perceived threat of the application of coercive force on the part of the participants, while protests may be confined to the expression of opinions and demands.    

<user_id=Unused000705>
An uprising is ""an act of resistance of rebellion"", it could be non-violent a la Gandhi, so violence is not the main factor. Protests are less wideranging. What is occuring is the 'rising up' of Tunisian society (not just one group or social class) so I think uprising is appropriate for now.

<user_id=Cs32en>
An uprising may remain non-violent, but the aspect of potential violence is one of the characteristics of an uprising. As Gandhi said, ""I do believe that, where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence... I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour than that she should, in a cowardly manner, become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonor.""    

<user_id=Unused000705>
It is hard to tell whether there will be violence or not. The whole crisis was not predicted by any serious commentator in the west, Tunisia was considered a model for the region in its stability. That said, uprising still seems to me to be the best description of events. Some have gone as far as to call it a revolution.

<user_id=72.228.177.92>
A Revolution, if the people of North Africa can keep it. But not here, not yet. ""Protests/Unrest"" seen from here at this point. If a second government collapses, then a larger article worthy of the event will come pretty quickly with something like Revolution in the title.

<user_id=Lihaas>
I think, and discussed above, that a move to at least uprisin g is more than warranted. though id hold off on revolution just yet (unkless it was called a generic revolution with the ""jasmine"" caveat)(  ).

<user_id=Nightstallion>
I think ""Tunisian Revolution"" or ""2010–2011 Tunisian Revolution"" or ""Jasmine Revolution"" are all sensible article names by now. —

<user_id=Lihaas>
the sources for revolution (#3,4,5) link to youtube and facebook. which i think we can all agree is not RS. Jasmne revolution as discussed here was moved to the unbolded parts of the lead because of its limited nature in the media, whereas the universal media hasnt tagged it as such. And the gerneral bolding og the timeline is unwarranted by any precedent.(  ).

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. <user_id=Jpatokal> starts the discussion by pointing out the discrepancy in the naming of the Tunisian event across different parts of the article and suggests sticking with ""protests"" until a consensus is reached. This is a logical approach to maintain consistency and avoid premature conclusions.

2. <user_id=Jpatokal> also raises a valid point about the end date of the revolution, suggesting that it may be too early to declare an end. This shows a careful consideration of ongoing events and their unpredictable nature.

3. <user_id=Jpatokal> further notes that even government sources refer to the event as a ""revolution,"" which could be a strong argument for renaming the article. This shows an awareness of the evolving nature of the situation and the importance of reflecting the perception of those involved.

4. <user_id=Unused000705> argues for the term ""uprising,"" citing the use of the term by reliable sources like the Guardian newspaper. This demonstrates an effort to align the article with reputable sources.

5. <user_id=Cs32en> provides a definition of ""uprising"" that includes the potential for violence, which is a relevant consideration in characterizing the nature of the event.

6. <user_id=Unused000705> counters by saying that an uprising can be non-violent and that the term is appropriate due to the widespread nature of the Tunisian event. This shows an understanding of the nuances of political terminology.

7. <user_id=Cs32en> quotes Gandhi to illustrate that even non-violent uprisings carry the aspect of potential violence, adding depth to the discussion about the appropriate term to use.

8. <user_id=72.228.177.92> takes a cautious approach, suggesting that the term ""revolution"" may be premature and that ""protests/unrest"" is more appropriate at the current stage. This shows a conservative approach to naming, likely to avoid overstatement.

9. <user_id=Lihaas> agrees that ""uprising"" is warranted but advises against ""revolution"" until it is more widely accepted. This shows a willingness to update the terminology but with caution.

10. <user_id=Nightstallion> advocates for ""Tunisian Revolution"" or related terms, indicating a belief that the event has reached the threshold of a revolution. This shows a more assertive stance on the naming based on the user's interpretation of the situation.

11. <user_id=Lihaas> points out that some sources for ""revolution"" are not reliable, emphasizing the need for credible references in the article. This is an important reminder of Wikipedia's standards for source quality.

Overall, the discussion is characterized by thoughtful consideration of terminology, reference to reliable sources, and an understanding of the political implications of the terms used. The participants engage in a respectful debate, each contributing valuable perspectives and showing a willingness to adapt their views as the situation evolves.

Name
The name of the treaty has already been established to be the ""Treaty of Defensive Alliance"". No other common name exists.

<user_id=Keysanger>
Of course there are another names, in fact it is usually named ""Secret Treaty"". But, for now, we set it to ""Treaty of Defensive Alliance"". No problem. But it is de rigueur to say that:
there are another names
it was secret and not only not published
it is related with the Peruvian Saltpeter Monopoly.
it was forged against Chile
it was, according to the Chilean Government, one of the causes of the War of the Pacific

<user_id=MarshalN20>

<user_id=Keysanger>
Please, refer to following questions:
there are another names (see refs you deleted)
it was secret and not only not published (ask someone that explain you the difference)
it is related with the Peruvian Saltpeter Monopoly. (Carlos Contreras Carranza, Gonzalo Bulnes, etc say it)
it was forged against Chile (see Burr page 130)
it was, according to the Chilean Government, one of the causes of the War of the Pacific (see Manifesto to the friedly powers of the Chilean government)

<user_id=MarshalN20>
Those references do not support your claim for a different name. All they do is indicate that the treaty was secret. The treaty's secrecy is mentioned in '''the first sentence''' (the eight word, to be more exact).
If a different name has so many references favoring it, then the move request would have been in your favor. It was not. If you have any questions about the decision to rename the page, you can always ask the closer .

Robert N. Burr, in ''By Reason Or Force: Chile and the Balancing of Power in South America, 1830-1905'', a often cited ouvre about History of Chile, has a special chapter beginning at page 124 with the name ""The Secret Treaty Between Peru and Bolivia"".
William Jefferson Denis, in his valuable ""Documentary History of the Tacna Arica Dispute"" published by the University of Iowa Studies in the Social Sciences, has compiled 90 treaties, memorandum, letters, official declarations, etc, etc, about the War of the Pacific. In the index of the compilation, page 5, as well as in page 56, at the beginnig of the text given as introduction to the content, he names the treaty ''Treaty of Defensive Alliance or ""Secret Treaty"" between Peru and Bolivia, 1873""''.
So, there is another name, much more common than the vacuousness of ""Treaty of Defensive Alliance"". By WP:OTHERNAMES this alternative must be there.

<user_id=MarshalN20>
You're trying very hard to fit any source you find to support your view. The titling of a ""special chapter"" does not mean that this is an alternative name for the treaty. As you leave me little option, I will report this to AN/I. The misuse of sources from your part is absolutely deplorable.

<user_id=MarshalN20>
With regards to Robert N. Burr and his subsection title, under the logic presented by your argument, Wikipedia should also have an article titled ""'''The Bridge that Two Wars Built'''"" (which is the title he uses in Page 97 for the Chincha Islands War and the Paraguayan War). Burr also has a subsection titled ""'''The United States Retreats'''"" (Page 159). Book subsection titles are a personal decision made by the author; your attempt to manipulate the source to fit your point of view is unacceptable.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User MarshalN20 argues that the name ""Treaty of Defensive Alliance"" has been established and that no other common name exists. They emphasize that the treaty's secrecy is already mentioned in the first sentence of the article, suggesting that the article's current title is sufficient and that the secrecy aspect is not being ignored.

2. User Keysanger counters by providing references to support the existence of an alternative name, ""Secret Treaty,"" and argues that this name is more common and descriptive. They cite specific sources, including Robert N. Burr and William Jefferson Denis, who use the term ""Secret Treaty"" in their works.

3. User MarshalN20 responds by questioning the relevance of the sources provided by Keysanger, arguing that the titling of a book chapter does not necessarily reflect a common name for the treaty. They also express concern about the potential misuse of sources.

4. The discussion involves a disagreement over the naming of the treaty, with one user emphasizing the established name and the other providing evidence of an alternative name used in historical literature.

5. Both users present arguments with some merit: MarshalN20 is focused on consistency and the outcome of a previous move request, while Keysanger is attempting to provide evidence of alternative naming from historical sources.

6. The quality of the discussion is somewhat hampered by the apparent frustration and potential for escalation to administrative noticeboards, which can detract from the collaborative nature of the discussion.

7. The discussion could be improved by both parties attempting to find a consensus on how to incorporate the alternative name into the article in a way that is informative and reflective of historical usage without undermining the established name.

Overall, the discussion shows engagement with sources and an attempt to argue based on historical evidence. However, the quality is affected by the potential for escalation and the lack of a collaborative approach to resolving the disagreement.

FBI leaked document

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
You're trying to create a false narrative here.

<user_id=Terrorist96>
Re:  The logos were considered to resemble pedophile logos is based on the FBI leaked document. Why do you oppose including that fact in order to explain the connection? It's mentioned in the NYT source.

<user_id=Terrorist96>
How is it a false narrative? It's stated in the NYT article.

<user_id=Eggishorn>
What VM said.  The ''Inquisitr'' reference you tried to add has been rejected as far too credulous earlier, and the ""leaked FBI document"" has never been authenticated.  The NYT article uses multiple qualifiers, which were left out.

<user_id=Terrorist96>
Thanks for explaining. Can you link me to the discussion that determined the inquisitor article should be excluded? I searched and didn't find consensus to not use that article (mostly about aceloewgold.com, whatever that is). And this is all I found searching WP:RSN about using it as an RS. And there are other sources that connect the Satanic ritual claim with the mention of ""spirit cooking"" in the leaked emails; see: Snopes. This isn't to claim that the spirit cooking is actually Satanic, but that that was why the connection was made. And if we're mentioning the theories, we should state the reason behind the theory. This is already done for the handkerchief code theory (explaining that it arose based on the email saying: ""The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related.""
Re: FBI document: We can put ""unverified"" prior to ""F.B.I. document"" if you like. However, again, the point is not whether it's been authenticated or not, but the fact the theory of the logos being connected to pedophile logos arose based on the FBI document. And I never got an explanation for ""false narrative""; I was just explaining the reason behind the theories.

<user_id=NorthBySouthBaranof>
'The Inquisitr'' is not a reliable source, and moreover, the claim that they are ""similar"" is entirely-unsourced anonymous pareidolia; the phrasing you are choosing implies that somehow the purported ""leaked FBI document"" supports the idea that these purported similarities are in any way meaningful, which it does not.

<user_id=Terrorist96>
You say Inquisitor isn't a reliable source, but you didn't provide a link to that consensus. The article already uses the word ""similarities"" for the Satanic and pedophilic symbols(''Theorists linked the conspiracy to Comet Ping Pong, through similarities between company logos and symbols related to Satanism and pedophilia.''). So should that be removed? Fair enough on the phrasing, can you help rephrase it? How about: ''""based on purported similarity to an unauthenticated leaked FBI document.""'' Do you deny that the FBI documents were the reason the connection was made though?

<user_id=Slatersteven>
Can we have a link to the Inquisitor article?

<user_id=Terrorist96>
Link.

<user_id=Slatersteven>
Having trouble finding the mention of the FBI leaked document mention.

<user_id=Objective3000>
The first sign that this is a terrible article is  The author of the article mostly writes about professional wrestling. Seriously, this is not close to a reliable source.

<user_id=Terrorist96>
That's just a reported fact. At one point people did have theories of Julian Assange being assassinated because he hadn't made a public appearance for some time. Regardless, I'm not trying to add that to the article and the Snopes link also mentions spirit cooking. I just find it odd that the article mentions satanic ritual theories but doesn't explain the genesis of those theories being linked to the mention of spirit cooking in the leaked emails.

<user_id=Terrorist96>
That's cuz it's mentioned in the NYT article: link. The Inquisitor link was for mentioning spirit cooking.

<user_id=Slatersteven>
Err the NYT article does not say the FBI found  the logos were similar to Pedophile ones, rather it says that third parties said the FBI listed logos looked like those from the pizza place. The FBI document did not make the comparison.

<user_id=Terrorist96>
I never claimed that the FBI made the comparison. I simply said that the theorists came to their conclusion that the company logos were pedophilic based on the FBI document that purports to show ""Symbols and Logos Used by Pedophiles to Identify Sexual Preferences"".

<user_id=Slatersteven>
Sorry but I cannot find where you say anything more then the rather misleading ""based upon an leaked FBI document"". This maybe whyt it's inclusion is being opposed. Now if you wanted to say ""non professional investigators took logos linked to pedophiles and claimed they looked like the ones used by..."" that might just pass muster.

<user_id=Terrorist96>
Yeah, the claim that the logos are similar to pedophile logos is based upon the FBI document. I offered a revised version: ''based on purported similarity to an unauthenticated leaked FBI document'' above. Would you continue to object to this wording as well? There's nothing here saying that the FBI made the comparison. The comparison was made by the theorists.

<user_id=Slatersteven>
Which is why the fact it is an FBI document is irrelevant. They could just have easily used a copy of the Beno or an episode of Black Adder. The fact that the document was produce by the FBI does not give the theorists analysis of it any validity. Hell even the document it's self is unverified.

<user_id=Terrorist96>
So are we supposed to ignore the source just because it's a purported FBI document? I'm not trying to provide validity to the claims, just explain their genesis. When the article says the logos were claimed to look similar to pedophile logos, a reader may wonder what that claim is based on. What are pedophile logos? Why did they think the logos looked like pedophile logos? The NYT article mentions this, I don't see why we should omit it.

<user_id=Slatersteven>
The reader has a link they can go to, that explains it more fully then we can. This is what the text would have to say

<user_id=Slatersteven>
On line investigators (with no connection to enforcement) looked at an alleged FBI document and concluded that the logos the document claimed were logos used by pedophiles as a kind of secret system of recognition looked similar to corporate logos used by some of the stores alleged to be part of pizzagate. It has been pointed out that many organisations use similar logos, and that no law enforcement agency (including the FBI) had made such a link.

<user_id=Slatersteven>
So do we agree to this wording?.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The discussion begins with <user_id=Terrorist96> mentioning an FBI leaked document that allegedly connects company logos to pedophile symbols. The user is attempting to include this information in an article to explain the origin of a conspiracy theory.

2. <user_id=Volunteer Marek> accuses <user_id=Terrorist96> of creating a false narrative, but does not provide specific reasons for this claim at this point in the discussion.

3. <user_id=Eggishorn> provides a more substantive argument, stating that the ""leaked FBI document"" has never been authenticated and that the New York Times (NYT) article uses qualifiers that were omitted in the proposed edit, which could lead to a misrepresentation of the source material.

4. <user_id=Terrorist96> responds by asking for evidence of the consensus that the Inquisitr article should be excluded and provides a rationale for including the connection between the conspiracy theory and the mention of ""spirit cooking"" in leaked emails, citing Snopes as a source.

5. <user_id=NorthBySouthBaranof> argues that the Inquisitr is not a reliable source and that the proposed phrasing implies an endorsement of the conspiracy theory by the FBI, which is not the case.

6. <user_id=Slatersteven> requests a link to the Inquisitr article for verification and later points out that the NYT article does not claim the FBI found the logos similar, but rather that third parties made that claim based on the FBI document.

7. <user_id=Objective3000> criticizes the quality of the Inquisitr article based on the author's usual subject matter, implying that the author may not have the expertise to write on the topic at hand.

8. <user_id=Terrorist96> and <user_id=Slatersteven> continue to discuss the phrasing, with <user_id=Slatersteven> suggesting a more neutral and detailed description of how the theorists came to their conclusions.

9. The discussion ends with <user_id=Slatersteven> proposing a comprehensive wording that includes the nature of the investigators, the source of the logos, and the lack of official endorsement by law enforcement agencies.

The quality of the arguments improves as the discussion progresses. Initially, the arguments are more about the inclusion or exclusion of certain sources without much detail. As the conversation continues, the participants provide more detailed reasoning and evidence for their positions. The final proposed wording by <user_id=Slatersteven> shows a collaborative effort to reach a neutral and informative consensus that takes into account the concerns raised throughout the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Corruption

<user_id=GliderMaven>
According to  the NPOV on Capitalism is that there is no corruption in capitalism, it isn't subject to it at all; it is no way a weakness of Capitalism. Rich individuals never pay off politicians to write laws to distort markets. We Wave Been Told. Corruption can only happen under communism or whatever(!?) Apparently he's going to edit war until that's widely accepted.

<user_id=The Four Deuces>
You are referring to the reversal of your section on corruption.  The problems with that section include that it is unsourced and does not explain the connection between corruption and capitalism.  Advanced capitalist countries actually have lower corruption levels.

<user_id=Absolutelypuremilk>
Firstly,  did not say that. Secondly do you have any reliable sources that say that corruption is more prevalent under capitalism than other economic systems?

<user_id=GliderMaven>
I made no claim that is more common, only that it is a known weakness that rich individuals not infrequently pay/finance politicians for favourable laws. Are you claiming that corruption cannot happen under capitalism and that it shouldn't even be mentioned? There's articles like crony capitalism and robber barons about how that happens at least ''sometimes.'' You certainly get corruption under (for example) communism, but it's usually of a different form.

<user_id=Absolutelypuremilk>
I am not saying that it cannot happen, but that doesn't mean that it should be included.

<user_id=GliderMaven>
Crony capitalism shouldn't be mentioned in an article on capitalism?

<user_id=Absolutelypuremilk>
The material that you added made no mention of capitalism, it was a general look at political corruption, not specific to one economic system.

<user_id=GliderMaven>
OK, then I will add crony capitalism.

<user_id=The Four Deuces>
Crony capitalism is already mentioned in the article but if you want to expand it, you need to show its relevance.  As I understand it, underdeveloped and Communist countries have a history of corruption that continues as they develop capitalism.  So a neutral way to put it into the article is to explain the introduction of capitalism into these countries that do not have strong liberal traditions.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. GliderMaven introduces the topic of corruption in relation to capitalism, suggesting that it is a known weakness and should be acknowledged in the context of capitalism. The argument is based on the premise that rich individuals may influence politicians for favorable laws, which is a form of corruption.

2. The Four Deuces responds by pointing out that GliderMaven's section on corruption was unsourced and did not make a clear connection between corruption and capitalism. The argument here is that without sources and clear relevance, the information is not suitable for inclusion. The Four Deuces also mentions that advanced capitalist countries have lower levels of corruption, which is a counterpoint to GliderMaven's claim.

3. Absolutelypuremilk asks for reliable sources to support the claim that corruption is more prevalent under capitalism than other economic systems. This is a request for evidence to substantiate GliderMaven's implied claim.

4. GliderMaven clarifies that the claim was not about the prevalence of corruption but rather its existence as a weakness in capitalism. The argument is that corruption, such as crony capitalism, is a known issue and should be mentioned.

5. Absolutelypuremilk acknowledges that corruption can happen under capitalism but questions whether it should be included in the article, suggesting that the added material was too general and not specific to capitalism.

6. GliderMaven proposes to add information specifically about crony capitalism, which is a form of corruption related to capitalism.

7. The Four Deuces acknowledges that crony capitalism is already mentioned in the article but suggests that any expansion should show its relevance. The argument is that the discussion should be framed neutrally and consider the historical context of corruption in countries transitioning to capitalism.

Evaluation of Arguments:

- GliderMaven's initial argument lacks sources and specificity, which weakens the quality of the argument.
- The Four Deuces provides a counterargument that is more structured, requesting sources and relevance, which strengthens the discussion quality.
- Absolutelypuremilk's request for evidence is a valid point in a debate, which contributes positively to the discussion quality.
- GliderMaven's clarification and proposal to add specific information about crony capitalism show a willingness to improve the argument's relevance and specificity.
- The Four Deuces' suggestion to frame the discussion neutrally and consider historical context is a constructive approach to ensuring the neutrality and comprehensiveness of the article.

Overall, the discussion shows a progression from a less structured argument to a more nuanced and evidence-based debate. The participants are engaging in a constructive manner, seeking to improve the article's content through sourcing, relevance, and neutrality.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Comment from uninvolved

<user_id=Kautilya3>
My two cents. Since it was decided that British Mirpuri is the appropriate title for that page, it would be preferable to use that term in this article. You can of course make it clear that they are from the Azad Kashmir, and that they are often called ""British Kashmiri,"" but the general reference to them throughout the article should British Mirpuri. Otherwise, you can do another RfC, but it is fairly predictable how it would go. Cheers,

<user_id=Mar4d>
We should follow the source cited. If a source says Kashmiri, then I do not see why that should be discarded in favour for use of another term. It is not a good idea to discard reliable sources and leave this article to the interpretation of a single Wikipedia user. ''''''

<user_id=Human3015>
Mar4d reported me on ANI  for abuse of twinkle, here discussion is going on regarding content and he want to focus attention elsewhere when he has nothing to defend himself. No one is agree on his POV.  

<user_id=Mar4d>
I am not going to respond to your incivility. Focus on the content. Once again, I would like to ask you, can you explain why you reverted my restoration despite a source being given? ''''''

<user_id=Human3015>
You gave this 74 pages government document, now on which page it is mentioned, as I see on page 9, they have used word ""Mirpuri"".  

<user_id=Mar4d>
Here's an easy solution: Press CTRL + F, search Kashmiri. Then check how many times it uses Kashmiri. I can't find much usage of Mirpuri, I think it only used 4 or 5 times. Be aware of WP:Source falsification, claiming that the source uses Mirpuri over Kashmiri is an example of that. ''''''
Also, for reference:
'''''

<user_id=Human3015>
Read page 7 of that government document, clearly mentioned ""Mirpuris"". You have not given page number of your latest comment. Moreover, your comment also says that they are called as ""Mirpuris"".  

<user_id=Human3015>
page 7 says   

<user_id=Human3015>
I just have to mention that, if UK govenrment has used word ""Mirpuris"" and they are actually Mirpuris, also there is article named British Mirpuris then why we should use confusing term ""Kashmiris""? You can see talk page of British Mirpuris which failed in move discussion to move it to British Kashmiris. We have communitty consensus for ""Mirpuri"". 

<user_id=Human3015>
See RfC here, where Mar4d himself voted against it. Now he has changed his stand. We have community consesus that word ""Mirpuri"" should be used. We have sources too. While ""Kashmiri"" is confusing term.  

<user_id=Mar4d>
That discussion was over the title of a different article, and the only reason why Mirpuris was retained was to differentiate it from other Kashmiris. Otherwise, that article's title should have been British Kashmiri were it not for that factor. As per my knowledge, there has never been any consensus for this article why Kashmiris should not be used here along with Mirpuris, when we have a vast number of sources which use both terms equally. ''''''

<user_id=Mar4d>
I am not sure why you are asking me for page number when I have given you the complete source? This shows that either you are deficient in being able to check sources and therefore are incompetent to participate in this discussion as you've not read the source, or it shows that you are cherry-picking a usage of your choice to claim that your favoured term is used over another term (Kashmiri), which the sources uses more frequently. That is a form of WP:Source falsification. How do you defend this selective reasoning? ''''''

<user_id=Kautilya3>
Wikipedia is supposed to represent the ''scholarly consensus''. You argument of ""follow the source"" suggests that you might cherry-pick sources to support your view point. But you have to represent ''all'' the scholarly opinions. -

<user_id=Mar4d>
But that is exactly what Human3015 is ''not'' doing. We have scholarly sources, and both terms are used in abundance, Mirpuri/Kashmiri. What Human3015 is doing is removing all references of the term 'Kashmiri' from the article, which is wrong, as the sources cited do not explicity favour one term over another. Both terms are used commonly, and therefore the article in its original shape is accurate, as it follows the sources and uses both terms where context requires so. As you say, we have to represent ''all'' scholarly opinions, and that would necessitate not giving preferential use to one term only. I quoted a source below which says Mirpuris are commonly referred to as Kashmiris, and we have more indeed. ''''''

<user_id=Mar4d>
Another problem with blanketing all of them under 'Mirpuris' is that Not all people from Azad Kashmir are neccessarily from Mirpur only. Hence, it is a minor issue when you use a placename demonym to lump all under that designation. ''''''

<user_id=Kautilya3>
(ec) There is no requirement that we should use every term used in every source. We have to write Wikipedia coherently. If it is clear that the same group of people are being referred to, there is no harm in changing the label in our write-up. Between the two terms, British Mirpuri is preferable, as decided by the RfC on Talk:British Mirpuri. -

<user_id=Mar4d>
WP:VERIFIABILITY says: ''Content is determined by previously published information rather than the beliefs or experiences of its editors. Even if you're sure something is true, it must be verifiable before you can add it. When reliable sources disagree, present what the various sources say, give each side its due weight, and maintain a neutral point of view''. As such, we are ''bound'' to represent all sources accurately and should not discard one view for another. The RfC on Talk:British Mirpuri is not relevant, as that was for deciding the accurate title of that article, not for the validity of the term 'Kashmiri' or 'Mirpuri'. ''''''

<user_id=Kautilya3>
In that case, I am afraid you have to do another RfC or take it to WP:DRN. -

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Use of Sources**: Both parties, <user_id=Mar4d> and <user_id=Human3015>, are discussing the use of terms ""British Mirpuri"" and ""British Kashmiri"" based on sources. <user_id=Mar4d> argues for the use of both terms as they are found in sources, while <user_id=Human3015> emphasizes the use of ""Mirpuri"" based on specific sources and community consensus from a previous RfC.

2. **Reference to Community Consensus**: <user_id=Human3015> refers to a previous RfC to support the use of ""Mirpuri"" over ""Kashmiri."" This shows an understanding of Wikipedia's consensus-driven approach. However, <user_id=Mar4d> counters that the RfC was specific to the title of a different article and not necessarily prescriptive for the use of terms within articles.

3. **Understanding Wikipedia Policies**: Both users reference Wikipedia policies such as WP:VERIFIABILITY and WP:Source falsification. <user_id=Mar4d> emphasizes the need to represent all sources accurately, while <user_id=Human3015> focuses on the clarity and consistency of terms used.

4. **Civility and Focus on Content**: There is a moment where the discussion veers into accusations of incivility and personal conduct (<user_id=Human3015> mentioning being reported by <user_id=Mar4d>). However, <user_id=Mar4d> redirects the conversation back to content, which is a positive aspect of the discussion.

5. **Argument Clarity and Coherence**: <user_id=Kautilya3> provides a third perspective, emphasizing the need for coherence in Wikipedia articles and the representation of scholarly consensus. This user also suggests that if there is a disagreement that cannot be resolved, another RfC or dispute resolution may be necessary.

6. **Engagement with the Issue**: All participants are actively engaged with the issue and provide various forms of evidence to support their positions. This indicates a high level of involvement and concern for the accuracy and clarity of the article.

Overall, the discussion shows a good understanding of Wikipedia policies, active engagement with the content, and a willingness to reference community consensus and sources. However, the quality of the discussion is somewhat diminished by the brief lapse into discussing user conduct rather than content and by some potential confusion over the applicability of the previous RfC to the current content dispute.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5
"<user_id=Tom Butler>
This article is seriously biased toward the prevailing skeptical view

<user_id=Tom Butler>
I have placed a NPOV tag on the article. it is clear that the majority of text here is negative with no pretense of presenting the man as his work. In all, it is being used to attack his views, rather than simply discussing his views.
For instance, under Books, we have: ''...Sheldrake's book is a splendid illustration of the widespread public misconception of what science is about. In reality, Sheldrake's argument is in no sense a scientific argument but is an exercise in pseudo-science... Many readers will be left with the impression that Sheldrake has succeeded in finding a place for magic within scientific discussion – and this, indeed, may have been a part of the objective of writing such a book.[13]''

<user_id=Tom Butler>
And more. There are many comments supporting the book, but of course, they are published in unacceptable publications. The solution is to just say what and not editorialize!

<user_id=TheRedPenOfDoom>
see all the talk above. When all of the mainstream science calls the work pseudoscience, then the NPOV view of the article MUST call the work pseudoscience.

<user_id=Ravensfire>
This.  It would be a blatant POV to NOT mention that some of his views are far off the majority viewpoint and have been discredited.

<user_id=Barney the barney barney>
, I understand you're new here so I've recommended you read the stuff at the top of this page.  Do not be surprised if a low level scientist (as Sheldrake was), starts making extraordinary claims without required evidence, that members of the scientific community call him out.  That's part of the scientific process.  Sheldrake's article is ""biased"" against him not because the editors are biased but because several prominent members of the scientific community are biased against nonsense.

<user_id=Tom Butler>
Barney, This is not about whether or not Sheldrake has been called out. See if you can stand back and take a look at the article as a whole. It is clearly an attack piece. Now consider what many of us have been working toward for Wikipedia for many years. The Wiki is too important to allow a few zealous editors to use it as a way of proving a person is wrong. That make any of us wanting to use Wikipedia as a reference look like idiots.
Either make the article neutral or I will put it up for deletion.

<user_id=Barney the barney barney>
A neutral article on a heavily disparaged subject is going to look like an ""attack piece"".  Please stop edit warring.

<user_id=Iantresman>
@ ""all of the mainstream science"" does not call his work pseudoscience. In this context, ""mainstream science"" is a weasel word (unsupported attribution). There is no dispute that several individuals have called his work pseudoscience. There are also examples of academia who do not chacterise Sheldrake's work as pseudoscience, such as the University of Cambridge, the University of Edinburgh's Koestler Parapsychology Unit, the University of London's Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit, the University of Arizona's Center for Consciousness Center, the University of Northampton's Centre for the Study of Anomalous Psychological Processes, the UK's Open University, Binghamton University, NY,.
And then we have the peer-reviweed papers that examine Sheldrake's without prejudice, eg. in the Journal of Consciousness Studies (2011),, and, peer-reviewed papers by Sheldrake himself, eg. in The Journal of Science and Healing, And mentions in academic books such as the ''Encyclopedia of Creativity'' (Elsevier),

<user_id=TheRedPenOfDoom>
uhhh, like I said, all of the mainstream academics. that pseudo-scientists see him as one of their own, well that sells it right there.

<user_id=Tom Butler>
Well, there you have it; the reason this article is not balanced: the position some editors are taking is that scientists do think it is pseudoscience are writing in acceptable publications and the scientists who do not think it is pseudoscience are also pseudoscientists and therefore their opinion does not count.
Is that about right?

<user_id=ජපස>
The ""Journal of Consciousness Studies"" is a terrible source that is certainly not independent of the fantastical claims.
Hans-Peter Durr is normally described as ""wacky"" when it comes to his proposals on consciousness (similar to Roger Penrose). As such, we can safely dismiss his credulity as pseudoscientific.
So, no, you haven't actually been able to satisfy my request. Again, we need an independent source, not a fellow believer in magical quantum consciousness.

<user_id=ජපස>
It must be upsetting to those who are on the losing side of the argument, but essentially, Wikipedia's rules on reliable sourcing demand that we pay deference to those who are actually mainstream. Sorry.

<user_id=Iantresman>
Are you suggesting that all the academic institutions I listed above, are not mainstream, and if so, how you came to that conclusion? There seems to be a suggestion that anyone who investigates parapsychology without prejudice is by definition non-mainstream, and anyone who investigates parapsychology in order to disprove it, is mainstream?

<user_id=ජපස>
Are you honestly suggesting that morphic resonance is not a proposal by Sheldrake? That is, do you really want me to provide a source that Sheldrake suggested this idea himself? Because according to my dictionary, that's what ""proposal"" actually means. If you think it's not a ""proposal"", do you think it is an ""idea"" at least?

<user_id=Tumbleman>
the only thing that is being lost here is the spirit of WP.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Tom Butler's Argument**: Tom Butler is arguing that the article on Wikipedia is biased against Rupert Sheldrake and his work, presenting it in a negative light without giving due consideration to the positive aspects or the support his work has received. He is advocating for a neutral point of view (NPOV) and suggests that the article should present the information without editorializing.

2. **TheRedPenOfDoom's Argument**: TheRedPenOfDoom counters by stating that when mainstream science labels work as pseudoscience, the NPOV on Wikipedia must reflect that consensus. This implies that the article should represent the majority view within the scientific community.

3. **Ravensfire's Argument**: Ravensfire supports TheRedPenOfDoom's stance, suggesting that it would be a biased point of view (POV) to not mention that Sheldrake's views are not widely accepted and have been discredited by the majority.

4. **Barney the barney barney's Argument**: Barney emphasizes that criticism from the scientific community is part of the scientific process and that an article on a heavily criticized subject will naturally appear negative. He advises Tom Butler to stop edit warring.

5. **Iantresman's Argument**: Iantresman brings up that not all mainstream science considers Sheldrake's work pseudoscience and lists several academic institutions and publications that have engaged with Sheldrake's work without prejudice. This suggests that there is some level of mainstream academic engagement with Sheldrake's ideas.

6. **ජපස's Argument**: ජපස dismisses the Journal of Consciousness Studies as a credible source and labels some of Sheldrake's supporters as pseudoscientific. He emphasizes Wikipedia's rules on reliable sourcing, which prioritize mainstream sources.

7. **Tumbleman's Argument**: Tumbleman's comment is more of a lament about the spirit of Wikipedia being lost, rather than a direct argument about the content of the article or the nature of the sources.

The discussion quality varies among participants. Some arguments are more focused on adhering to Wikipedia's guidelines and reflecting the consensus of the scientific community, while others are concerned with ensuring that the article is not biased and presents a fair account of Sheldrake's work. The debate touches on important aspects of Wikipedia's editorial standards, such as neutrality and reliable sourcing. However, there is a lack of consensus on what constitutes a mainstream source and how to balance different viewpoints within an article.

Overall, the discussion is robust and involves critical points about the nature of scientific consensus, the representation of minority views, and the application of Wikipedia's policies. The participants are engaged and provide reasoning for their positions, even though there is a clear disagreement.

Aromanian origin

<user_id=Rolandi+>
You don't like his Aromanian origin so you deleted it.Don't continue with your childish anti-Aromanian ideas.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
The specific reference indeed mentions that he was of Vlach origin, nevertheless I can't verify this posibility from additional material. I would have no objection to add this inside, but there is a lack of  an inline citation to check where is this taken from, not to mention that a work titled ""History of Greece"" is a tertiary (of general nature) source, that should be treated per Wikipedia:Use of tertiary sources.

<user_id=Rolandi+>
These:   tell the truth.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
The last work is clearly a secondary source. Thus, it appears this possibility is well supported.

<user_id=Umpire Empire>
The above sources would normally be good additions to the article if they weren't general survey sources that briefly mention Evangelos Zappas and the formation of the modern Olympics. Kaphetzopoulos, for example, focuses on the history of Northern Epirus and ''only lists'' the names of ""Vlachs"" (i.e., Aromanian-speaking Greeks) who contributed to Greece including Evangelos Zappas (Kaphetzopoulos, however, provides no details about the modern Olympics or even about Zappas's historic role in their development). As for Thomopoulos and Smerlas, they only provide a ''summary'' of Greek history with no references to primary or even secondary sources (no way to confirm where they're getting their information from). I don't really mind including an Aromanian origin for Zappas, but such an origin is technically fringe since mainstream scholars who've studied the modern Olympics (i.e., Brownell, Decker, Gerlach, Hill, Landry, Landry, Yerlès, etc.) have already determined that Evangelos Zappas was a Greek.

<user_id=Rolandi+>
Vlachs are not Aromanian-speaking Greeks.Don't believe every lie you hear in the Greek media.Also don't delete the Vlach origin anymore.Who said that mainstream scholars claims he was greek?

<user_id=Zoupan>
Now I am anti-Aromanian? And you still claim to have the intention to show ""the truth""... I am not against inclusion if reliably supported as already said.

<user_id=Rolandi+>
Yes there are three sources supporting the Aromanian origin so it will be added.

<user_id=Umpire Empire>
Greek media lies? Are you kidding me? First of all, ""Vlachs"" is a ''very broad term'' applied to different ethnic/linguistic groups with similar pastoral lifestyles. Kaphetzopoulos uses ""Vlachs"" to specifically refer to Aromanian-speaking Greeks (or perhaps just Greek pastoralists) based on the individuals he lists all of whom were Greeks or at least self-identified as Greeks. But regardless of what Kaphetzopoulos really means when he uses the word ""Vlachs"", the fact remains that Kaphetzopoulos ''only lists'' Zappas as a ""Vlach"" with no biographical details to substantiate the use of the label. So even if one can interpret the word ""Vlachs"" in Kaphetzopoulos as strictly meaning ""ethnic Aromanians"" (whatever that means), Kaphetzopoulos cannot be included in the entry since mainstream historians studying both Zappas and the modern Olympics have already determined that Zappas was a Greek (Zappas himself neither came from an Aromanian family nor self-identified as an ""ethnic Aromanian""). And though I personally don't mind adding an Aromanian origin to the article, the inclusion of such an origin violates WP:FRINGE. So I kindly ask that you stop adding fringe nonsense and read the quality mainstream sources already in the article (i.e., Brownell, Decker, Gerlach, Hill, Landry, Landry, Yerlès) all of which describe and classify Evangelos Zappas as a Greek.

<user_id=Rolandi+>
Can you prove that the Aromanian origin is fringe? If not stop deleting it.

<user_id=Umpire Empire>
Can you prove that Zappas's Aromanian origin is the ''consensus among mainstream/specialist scholars''? You can't, which is why you keep peddling the weak sources (violating WP:RS and WP:FRINGE) that ''only mention'' Zappas's Aromanian origin without any biographical details to back up the claim. If you actually read the ''reliable sources'' in the entry that focus on Zappas's background, you'll see that ''none of them make any mention of Zappas being an Aromanian'' (if they did, then an Aromanian origin would have been included in the article months ago). So just accept the fact that Zappas was just a Greek and move on, because your unhealthy fixation on Zappas's ethnic origins is beginning to look a lot like disruptive trolling (WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT).

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Source Validity and Reliability**: The discussion revolves around the validity and reliability of sources that claim Evangelos Zappas was of Aromanian origin. User Alexikoua points out the need for inline citations and expresses concern over the use of tertiary sources, which is a valid point in maintaining the integrity of Wikipedia's content. User Umpire Empire further elaborates on the nature of the sources, explaining that they are general survey sources and do not provide detailed biographical information to substantiate the claim of Aromanian origin. This indicates a strong understanding of Wikipedia's source requirements.

2. **Adherence to Wikipedia Policies**: User Umpire Empire references Wikipedia's policies on fringe theories (WP:FRINGE) and reliable sources (WP:RS), indicating a good grasp of Wikipedia's standards for content inclusion. This user also emphasizes the consensus among mainstream scholars, which is a key aspect of Wikipedia's neutrality policy.

3. **Ethnicity and Identity**: The discussion touches on the complex issue of ethnicity and identity, with User Rolandi+ asserting that Vlachs are not Aromanian-speaking Greeks. This is a point of contention that requires careful handling and reliable sources to avoid misrepresentation.

4. **Accusations and Tone**: The dialogue includes accusations of anti-Aromanian bias and claims of lies in Greek media, which detract from the overall quality of the argument. These statements are not constructive and do not contribute to a resolution based on factual evidence and reliable sourcing.

5. **Request for Proof**: User Umpire Empire asks for proof that Zappas's Aromanian origin is the consensus among mainstream scholars, which is a reasonable request in a debate about historical facts. However, User Rolandi+ does not provide such proof, instead insisting on the inclusion of the Aromanian origin without addressing the concerns about source reliability and consensus.

Overall, the discussion shows a mix of strong arguments concerning Wikipedia's policies and source requirements, as well as less constructive elements such as accusations and a lack of substantial evidence for certain claims. The participants who reference Wikipedia's guidelines and the need for reliable sourcing contribute positively to the discussion quality, while the unsubstantiated assertions and confrontational tone from others detract from it.

Band members as of June 2013

<user_id=Fezmar9>
I'd have to say that 90% of the edits to this article in the last year, outside of genre fiddling, have pertained to who is actually in Norma Jean right now — almost all of them have been unsourced changes. I'd like to place a template in the members section, maybe Template:Disputed, to let the readers know the information may not be accurate. As soon as Norma Jean's new album is publicly announced, there will be a press release explaining who is currently in the band and it will likely clear up any confusion that currently exists about former members. I imagine that will happen about two months from now, but for now, I think the readers should know by way of some disclaimer or template that the information could be false or outdated. Thoughts?

<user_id=Walter Görlitz>
Sounds like a plan.

<user_id=TheKeviKev125>
I am the one that just made the band member update to include John Finnegan. I can insure that the current line up is accurate as I am a member of Norma Jeans management team at Blood Company.  (talk)

First off, you should familiarize yourself with Wikipedia's Policies and Guidelines regarding a possible conflict of interest. In general, editing a subject that you're connected with is heavily frowned upon and could result in your account being blocked, depending on what you're contributing. It's generally recommend that editors who have a close connection just stick to commenting on talk pages, and not actually edit articles. Second, Wikipedia is supported by published, authoritative sources. Even if this is the '''true lineup''' of Norma Jean, Wikipedia would prefer to have some sort of published documentation supporting that. Please also familiarize yourself with Wikipedia's policy on Verification. That being said, are you, as the band's management, familiar with any published articles that discuss the current state of Norma Jean's lineup?

<user_id=TheKeviKev125>
I do truly apologize for that. I am very, very new to Wikipedia and in no way meant to violate any policies or procedures of the website.

It's perfectly understandable. No one expects any new user to know any of the seemingly endless list of policies that exist here. I've been editing in my free time for 5+ years now, and there's several policies that pop up that are news to me. You're free to make any minor corrections (commas, periods, spelling errors, broken links, etc.) but as far as adding or removing content, I would recommend sticking to the talk page and providing a source to back up any changes that you feel should be made.

<user_id=Fezmar9>
We try to avoid using social media as an authoritative source whenever possible. Was I correct when I said in the next two months there will probably be a press release about Norma Jean's new album that will likely address who is in and who is out of the band?

<user_id=Walter Görlitz>
We try to avoid using social media links for supporting material such as release of singles, videos, etc. For band members, it's probably the best source. In this case though, and others where it's not updated frequently, it's apparently not a good source.

<user_id=3family6>
I would say assume good faith that User:TheKeviKevi125 is who they say they are, and can vouch for the accuracy of the Facebook page. For purposes in the article, we are relying on the latest update for the Facebook page, accurate or no, as it is the most recent official listing released.''''''''''

<user_id=Fezmar9>
The Facebook page must have been updated due to this discussion. Earlier in the morning yesterday, Walter Görlitz updated this article to reflect what Facebook had listed, which is different from what I'm seeing today. Part of what I was saying yesterday was stemming from the fact that I knew the Facebook listing to be wrong, especially with this comment. If it seems to be up to date to other editors, and other editors are okay with using a social media site in this situation, then I'll adhere to this consensus.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Fezmar9 raises a concern about the accuracy of the band member information for Norma Jean on Wikipedia and suggests using a template to indicate the disputed nature of the content. This is a constructive approach that aligns with Wikipedia's emphasis on verifiability and reliability.

2. User Walter Görlitz agrees with the plan, showing consensus and support for maintaining the integrity of the article.

3. User TheKeviKev125 claims to be part of Norma Jean's management and attempts to update the band member information, but acknowledges a lack of published sources. This user shows a willingness to engage with the Wikipedia community but lacks an understanding of Wikipedia's policies on verifiability and conflict of interest.

4. User Fezmar9 responds by informing TheKeviKev125 about Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, emphasizing the need for published sources and recommending that users with a conflict of interest refrain from editing articles directly. This response is informative and maintains the focus on Wikipedia's standards.

5. User TheKeviKev125 accepts the guidance and apologizes, showing a cooperative attitude and a willingness to learn and adhere to Wikipedia's rules.

6. User Fezmar9 further clarifies the preference for avoiding social media as a source and inquires about the possibility of an upcoming press release that could provide verifiable information. This shows a proactive approach to resolving the issue with reliable sources.

7. User Walter Görlitz points out the limitations of using social media for verification, contributing to the discussion about the reliability of different types of sources.

8. User 3family6 suggests assuming good faith regarding TheKeviKev125's identity and the accuracy of the Facebook page, but also acknowledges that the official listing is being used as the most recent source. This introduces a more lenient stance on source reliability but still within the context of Wikipedia's guidelines.

Overall, the discussion is characterized by a focus on maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the Wikipedia article, adherence to Wikipedia's policies, and a collaborative approach to resolving the issue. The participants are respectful, constructive, and willing to guide new users in understanding Wikipedia's standards.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 9.",9.0

Third Opinion Request

<user_id=Robert McClenon>
A third opinion has been requested about the map.  Exactly what is the issue about the map?  I see that one editor supports the map and one editor dislikes the map, but it isn't clear what the issue is.  I would suggest re-reading the civility policy, and clarifying what the question is.

<user_id=AcidSnow>
Well for starters, Somaliland is an autonomous region within Somalia. However, it's administration ""desires"" it's own independence from Somalia. Nonetheless, it's internationally recognized as an autonomous region within Somalia. Anyways, it's regional claims are disputed with that of Puntland and Awdalland. These regions are Sanaag and Sool, and Awdal respectively. Although they dispute these specific regions they recognize Somalilands claims to Woqooyi Galbeed and Togdheer. The map I created reflects exactly that. This is exactly what is done for various other places: South Ossetia, Transnistria, Abkhazia, etc. My design is very similar to that of the Autonomous communities of Spain, i.e Andalusia. More impotently, there was already a consensus established with three other users. These individuals being: CambridgeBayWeather (see here: ), Howicus (see here: ), and Rsrikanth05 (see here: ). Oddly enough, Dandaawi denies it's existence: ""All i see is you against the world. i see no consnsus"".

<user_id=AcidSnow>
What Dandaawi appears to desires is a map that doesn't include Somalia at all (despite Somaliland being a region within the nation). The map they also request doesn't even show the dispute with Awdalland. There might be other things that they desire as well, so you should ask them.

<user_id=Dandaawi>
The question is whats awdalland and where do they  control ?  Bring evidences that the So called  awdalland exists on the ground as an adminstration  challenging Somaliland rule in awdal. . The disputed area between Somaliland and puntland is already  marked on the above two  little maps. its also a well documented issue  as we can see here on bbc Somaliland profile [].   The reason i am against your map is is.
you marked  Awdal (western Somaliland] as disputed area.  Bring valid  evidence  that ""awdalland"" exits as an adminstration like Somaliland ?

<user_id=Dandaawi>
you fabricated the dispute area between Somaliland and puntland because you marked all Sool  and Sanaag as a disputed area although puntland claims the eastern parts of those regions ONLY   according to article 3 of puntland state constitution []
the map is different than any other Break away state map in wikipedia . Its close up image that shows only somalia regions. Somaliland location must be visible on the world map.
you used blue colors (Somalia flag color) to over shadow Somaliland existense.  Why cant we use that map right on top  if you dont have an agenda ?

<user_id=SemanticMantis>
Your points 3 and 4 seem at least somewhat valid. It should be no problem to change the shading to red or green or any other color. That being said, I think it's a stretch to say that the shading of the map implies pro-Somilia bias. Since it really doesn't matter, it shouldn't be a problem to change it either. I do think it would be best to show the situation within the continent. However, the maps above that show better context also make it hard to see the actual region in question. I'd suggest an inset be made for the newer map, similar to those above. The newer map is much easier to read, in my opinion. I can't comment on the first two points, that seems like more of an actual content dispute, whereas the others can be easily resolved.

<user_id=SemanticMantis>
there are about 7 or more de facto/ break away states  in the world none of them have such a close up map showing the country they seceded from only , why Somaliland is different ? .  If puntland (the rival unionist federal state of somalia). Have that map (look right in the middle) why Somaliland cant have the top red one ?  Both maps shows the exact disputed area. Why do we need this new map ? user AcidSnow never explained any thing before he replaced the older map  He just did, like wiki is his own blog.  In addition to that he must prove that the Socalled Awdalland exists as an actual authority  against Somaliland rule over Awdal province.

<user_id=AcidSnow>
Awdalland does exist as its own disputed territory. Although the state has done little work since 2009, it is nonetheless a disputed territory. More importantly, I didn't fabricate anything since Puntland claims on its own site that it claims all of Sanaag and Sool without giving any distinction, see here: . In fact, Puntland actually claims all of Sool in its own constitution as well, see here: . Nevertheless, I have updated the map to specific represent the constitution. I also added a map for the location of Somalia and Somaliland in as well. In addtion, I also plan to fix Puntlands map which is something I haven't gone around to. Anyways, kindly '''stop''' with the false accusations as they only speak negatively of you. As for the colors, I already explained this before that the specific color doesn't matter. In fact, the color Blue is none existent in the Spanish Flag but its nonetheless used in the Autonomous communities of Spain, i.e Andalusia.

<user_id=AcidSnow>
''Done'''. I have finally got around to fixing the maps of other regional states. These including Puntland, Jubbaland, and the South West State.

<user_id=Dandaawi>
Thanks for communicating ! I dont understand why you changed puntland map adding an other non practical dispute in nothern mudug region of puntland.  Its does not change the reality that there are only two functioning states in the north.Puntland and  Somaliland (federal vs defacto)  and one practically disputed area  between them. The rest of other disputed spots you marked in both states are unknown.  its crazy if we change every Somali diaspora or qabil  dream into reality.  Whats awdalland ? Where do they control ?  Are they state like puntland or  unionist Somalilanders in exile . Bring evidences. If we cant find any evidence please lets use the old puntland map you changed moment ago and the red Somaliland map that still appears over there. Also keep in mind that Somaliland is different than Puntland.Somaliland is seeking international recognition  so itS map should be similar to that of other break away defacto states. We can use  double  Maps close up and zoom out.  like these two examples .  BUT FIRST BRING EVIDENCE THAT AWDALLAND IS AN ACTUAL AUTHORITY AGAINST SOMALILAND RULE IN AWDAL. So we can solve the western portion  of the map you marked as disputed. Remember Exile unionist organizations  does not count when it comes territorial disputes. every state  have exile organisations  against their policy. Ethiopia  for example have dozens of diaspora anti TPLF ethincs and clans. I am not here to personally attack you or your country but i beleive informal reconciliation is more effective  than formal. I demand fairness  nothing more

<user_id=Ryk72>
FYI. I have removed the WP:3O request as there are now multiple editors engaged here. The issue also appears to have been resolved. -

<user_id=Dandaawi>
Sanaag dispute area (eastern Somaliland)   agreed after he fixed his map

Awdal dispute area (western Somaliland)  '''False''' awdalland  is an invented fictitious actor it does not exist As an Authority.

<user_id=Dandaawi>
Somaliland Map zoom out view '''Not solved'''  , But i accept ''' TWO MAP SOLUTION''' if he first correct the accuracy of his map.''' Awdal region  is not disputed'''

<user_id=AcidSnow>
We can continue this discussion once you learn not to attack others. Other than that, if you still want to discuss the two maps ""solution"" then it's best of you return.

<user_id=Dandaawi>
I already made my points clear. I demand fairness nothing more nothing less, i am not interested any form of fruitless quarrel.  i suggested multiple solutions including

<user_id=Dandaawi>
''Using the official  Somaliland Map only'''
'' Using the above (top) map showing the disputed eastern Sool and Sanaag regions   between Puntland and  Somaliland'''
''Two map solution'''  Plus you  should bring any reliable  evidences supporting your map that Awdalland exists  as a functioning state against Somaliland rule in western  Awdal region.
Can we agree any of the above?

<user_id=AcidSnow>
Sorry, but none of your ideas would work. See Awdalland for a start if your interested in learning about it. More importantly, cold you stop breaking consensus? Four users have already stated that they disagree with the map yet you continue to defy that and deny its existence? If not, then you risk being blocked.

<user_id=Buckshot06>
I've been asked to comment by Dandaawi. The map that shows the disputed areas in a different colour is preferable to the block red (I think ex British Somaliland) map, and honestly, whatever one's views on the political status of Somaliland, it has been very closely associated with the 1960-91 Somalia for a very long time, so the ""7"" shaped map does offer greater recognition for those who are not Somalia experts. I am very tempted however to parcel out equal blocks for anyone who keeps edit warring on this page - sort it out here on the talkpage, that's what it's here for. Regards to all

<user_id=AcidSnow>
Thanks for understanding Buckshot06, I greatly appreciate it. There was already a solution made but he has nonetheless ignored it. If you didn't notice in the request he made for you, he doesn't seem to mind making personal attacks against users. It seem that he too will get away with this as well.

<user_id=Dandaawi>
Acid  i already suggested 'two map solution'  which means i have nothing  against the 7 shaped map if its showing the exact disputed area between Somaliland and puntland only. What you did is you  marked Awdal as a disputed area ,  take a look at the west/left  side of the mapthumb The question is , is it true that awdal is disputed?  What is awdalland and where do they control? If you cant prove then fix the map so we can use it As a second image.   User     If you compare Somaliland's BBC  Country profile   [] against  Acid's map you can see that he marked undisputed regions as disputed without bringing any evidence

<user_id=AcidSnow>
As I have already pointed out having two maps makes little sense. Nonetheless, an consensus has already been established in regards to the map issue.

<user_id=Libanguled>
The currect Somaliland map is wrong because the real map of somali federal states indcluding somaliland is on this report

<user_id=Libanguled>
Please fix the current map of Somaliland to exclude the disputed area with Puntland because it is not fair to give disputed area to somaliland. At least highlight the disputed area on the map.

<user_id=AcidSnow>
Yes, I have already highlighted your concern in the map above.

<user_id=Bysomalilander>
next time just Google Somaliland map and see what you will find.somaliland not somlia .

<user_id=AcidSnow>
Actually there is a strong consensus for the previous map. The present map also doesn't show the disputed area between Puntland and Somaliland but rather what is thought to be controlled by the two regions. It also incorrectly designates Somaliland as a separate nation when it is internationally recognized as an autonomous region within Somalia. This isn't how it is illustrated with other regions, such as: South Ossetia, Transnistria, Abkhazia, etc. As I previously shown, this map present it accordingly along with all the other issues: .

<user_id=Kzl55>
The situation on the ground in 2017 is reflected on this most recent edit I am making. Somaliland is in full control in Awdal, Sool and Sanaag. Please respect the rules. (  )

",1,"The discussion revolves around the representation of Somaliland on a map, with particular focus on disputed territories and how they should be depicted. The main points of contention include the recognition of Somaliland's autonomy, the existence and recognition of Awdalland, the representation of disputed areas, and the color scheme used on the map.

1. **Recognition of Somaliland's Autonomy**: AcidSnow argues that Somaliland, while seeking independence, is internationally recognized as an autonomous region within Somalia. This is a factual statement that sets the stage for the map's context.

2. **Existence of Awdalland**: Dandaawi challenges the existence of Awdalland as a functioning authority, suggesting that it is a fictitious entity. AcidSnow counters by stating that Awdalland is a disputed territory, albeit with little activity since 2009. This point seems to lack a clear resolution, as there is a disagreement on the legitimacy and recognition of Awdalland.

3. **Representation of Disputed Areas**: There is a dispute over how the regions of Sool and Sanaag should be depicted on the map. AcidSnow provides evidence from Puntland's constitution claiming these areas, while Dandaawi argues that only the eastern parts are claimed. This indicates a need for clarity and precision in representing territorial claims.

4. **Color Scheme**: Dandaawi criticizes the use of blue (the color of the Somali flag) as overshadowing Somaliland's existence. SemanticMantis and AcidSnow suggest that the color is not indicative of bias and can be changed. This is a minor issue that can be resolved easily.

5. **Map Context and Scale**: Buckshot06 and Dandaawi discuss the importance of showing Somaliland's location within a broader geographical context. The suggestion of using an inset for clarity is a constructive solution to this issue.

6. **Consensus and Edit Warring**: AcidSnow mentions that there is a consensus among several users regarding the map, while Dandaawi continues to push for changes. Ryk72 notes that the issue appears to have been resolved, yet the discussion continues, indicating a lack of final agreement.

7. **Evidence and Sources**: Both parties reference various sources, such as Puntland's constitution and BBC country profiles, to support their claims. However, there is a disagreement on the interpretation of these sources and their implications for the map.

Overall, the discussion shows a mix of well-founded arguments, factual references, and attempts at compromise, alongside instances of personal attacks, unresolved disputes, and a lack of final consensus. The participants engage in a back-and-forth that reflects the complexity of the issue but also demonstrates some willingness to find a solution.

Given the mixture of constructive dialogue and unresolved conflict, the average quality of the arguments is moderate. The participants provide some evidence and attempt to reason through the issues, but the discussion is marred by personal attacks and a failure to reach a definitive resolution.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Disputed edits

<user_id=BeeCeePhoto>
'The collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin''. Thats what defines Institutional Racism. I wrote of the failure of the church to provide services in canada to the ethnic children rendered into its care, not about the residential schools. You removed that and replaced it with plagarized material explaining the residential schools. The fact that the church ran the schools needed that backdrop to show the continued, ingrained racism, not of the individuals, but of the system that allowed social workers(gov't) to remove babies from mothers, children from their families, and deliver them to a chop shop (residential schools) where TB infected kids were bedded with healthy kids whom had no immunities, abused and neglected, and left dying at a higher rate than if they had been left alone in their pagan villages. The worst of the abuse was doled out to the ones who were not christians (by Clerics and staff). Stop trying, you cannot change the past. If you want to write about the schools, be my guest. I'm writing about '''institutional racism''' - the two are not the same

<user_id=DivaNtrainin>
What's your point? If it's that we should have a section on the residential school system, then done.

<user_id=DivaNtrainin>
Why are you so against putting your edits on the Canadian Indian residential school system Wikipedia page? The reason why I want you to add it to that page and other well-moderated pages is so that you can get feedback from other editors and there will be consensus regarding whether to include this in Wikipedia or not. It will also prevent an edit war, since it won't be one editor vs another editor. It will be a group of editors coming together. As I said before, if you can get other editors on your side, then I will let the edits stand. What really surprises me is that you rant about how people should know about the aboriginal experience in Canada, but you refuse to take the simple steps to tell anyone about it.
The thing is that you correctly point out that I ""copied from another site"", which is something I mentioned I did in my own comments. I copied from a well-moderated, relevant, well -sourced Wikipedia page. That's not only allowed, but indicative that I am trying to be consistent with the writing and style of other editors. In fact, I will do more copying and pasting from one of the Wikipedia policy pages:
Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought Personal essays that state your particular feelings about a topic (rather than the opinions of experts). Although Wikipedia is supposed to compile human knowledge, it is not a vehicle to make personal opinions become part of such knowledge. In the unusual situation where the opinions of an individual are important enough to discuss, it is preferable to let other people write about them.
Wikipedia is not a soapbox or means of promotionA dvocacy, propaganda, or recruitment of any kind: commercial, political, scientific, religious, national, sports-related, or otherwise. An article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view. You might wish to start a blog or visit a forum if you want to convince people of the merits of your opinions.
Opinion pieces. Although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to ""climb soapboxes"" (for example, passionately advocate their pet point of view), Wikipedia is not the medium for this. Articles must be balanced to put entries, especially for current events, in a reasonable perspective, and represent a neutral point of view.
I will start reverting your edits unless you start getting more feedback regarding your edits. I don't think they are well-written, but don't take my word for it. If an edit war occurs, then you may be blocked from doing any edits. However, don't worry. They don't take away your user page for starting edit wars or being disruptive. Think about it, why would they take away your user page for being disruptive? Isn't it better to block people who are making inappropriate edits

<user_id=BeeCeePhoto>
Once more. I am working on Institutional racism. Whatever soapbox you're on, get over yourself. I am not working on the residential schools, whatever your opinion is. You go over there and play your edit games elsewhere. Facts and sources are the only currency that matter here, notability and research. Let's doit!

<user_id=DivaNtrainin>
Ok, if you are going to work on Institutional racism, then work on it. The entire page needs work on, so I am going to challenge you to start with the introduction and work down. One of my main problems is that your style of writing is frankly terrible, and if you work on the entire page, I think you are going to improve. For example, you randomly like to capitalize words for no apparent reason. You don't understand how to put in references to other Wikipedia pages, and you include weasel words. The reason I deleted your passage was because it seemed that my section and your section was the exact same topic, only yours seemed to be a random collection of ideas. I deleted it because we shouldn't have two sections on the same topic on the same Wikipedia page. Let me put it this way. I couldn't summarize your section into a sentence or two, because it seemed like you were going off on a tangent. So, here is my challenge, provide one of the two things:
''Summarize what you are trying to say in a sentence or two. Don't worry about references. Just tell me what you are trying to say.'''
''Tell me in one to two sentences, what general information you think was missing in my passage that needed to be added'''
If you provide this, other editors can help you figure out the best wording for this section.If you can't do this, its reflective that you are interested in an edit war.

<user_id=BeeCeePhoto>
No, you are the one deleting 2 paragraphs to get you own WP:POV across couching it with accusations of weasel words and copy and paste edit jargon. Leave it alone until another editor gets involved. You are actively WP:VAND the entry. You were not interested in the topic until I expanded the Canada section. You added two copied paragraphs and deleted the sourced piece. I don't see anything but a biased racism fact slant to your entry. I did change it (your entry) and added sources and correcting the introduced errors, but you keep returning your weasel entry and deleting the original. Step away, other editors will step up. Also, accusing me of bad writing is really low, especially coming from a cut 'n paste artist like yourself.

<user_id=BeeCeePhoto>
Of course I want other editors involved. That's why I encouraged you to post to other more active Wikipedia pages. If you could run your editing by some other editors, they would agree that you need to work on your writing. I am trying to help you, but I can't help you until you tell me what you are trying to say. Personally, I don't think you understand aboriginal issues. You don't understand the wide range of experiences and the complexities of the aboriginal residential school system. That's why I keep linking to a larger Wikipedia article, because this issue is larger than a short summary on this page. If you want to talk about racism, then here is my opinion: You are expressing a view that is similar to a lot of people who are racist against natives. Let's put the arguement as to who is racist aside,because no one will win that argument. Instead, give me something to work with, and I can help you improve your writing. Oh and if you want me to put in more references, just say the word and it will only take a minute or two.

<user_id=NeilN>
Both of you have been warned for edit warring. More reverts may result in blocks. If you want to get other editors involved, please look at the options at WP:DRR.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User BeeCeePhoto is focused on the topic of institutional racism and is attempting to highlight the systemic issues within the church's handling of ethnic children in Canada. The user is adamant about the distinction between the broader concept of institutional racism and the specific instance of the residential schools. The argument is based on the need to address systemic issues beyond individual events.

2. User DivaNtrainin is concerned with the quality of BeeCeePhoto's edits, suggesting that they are not well-written and lack coherence. This user is also pushing for the edits to be discussed on a more active Wikipedia page to gain consensus and avoid an edit war. DivaNtrainin is also emphasizing Wikipedia's policies on neutrality and not using the platform as a soapbox for personal opinions.

3. BeeCeePhoto feels that their edits are being unfairly removed and that DivaNtrainin is introducing a biased point of view. They express frustration with the accusation of poor writing and the deletion of their sourced material.

4. DivaNtrainin challenges BeeCeePhoto to clarify their argument in a concise manner and to explain what information is missing from DivaNtrainin's own edits. This challenge is meant to help improve the clarity and coherence of BeeCeePhoto's contributions.

5. User NeilN steps in as a mediator, warning both users about edit warring and suggesting dispute resolution resources.

Evaluation of Arguments:

- BeeCeePhoto's argument is passionate and focused on a specific aspect of institutional racism. However, the user's argument could benefit from more clarity and structure to effectively communicate the intended message.
- DivaNtrainin's argument is structured around Wikipedia's policies and the quality of content. The user's approach is procedural and aims to maintain the integrity of the Wikipedia page. However, the tone may come across as dismissive, which could escalate the conflict.
- The overall discussion lacks constructive dialogue and seems to be more about the conflict between the two users rather than the content itself. There is a need for more collaborative editing and less personal confrontation.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 4. The discussion shows some understanding of Wikipedia's policies and the importance of neutrality, but it is marred by personal conflict and a lack of constructive feedback and resolution.",4.0

Manipulation of sourced content

<user_id=Alexikoua>
It appears that we have large scale wp:own, especially in the case of Himara, which is traditionally seen as a predominantly Greek town. [].  Burridheut needs to explain why a mountain of reference in the correspondent article is useless according to him.

<user_id=Burridheut>
The claims that Himara is Greek, or Ethnic Greek, or Predominantly Greek, or Inherently Greek...or you name it, are part of an effort from the Greek state to create a so called Vorioepirote (Northern Epirote) region and claim for a referendum of autonomy (or independence perhaps) from Albania so that it latter joins Greece. That is a long term plan that has been advancing steadily, but has never succeeded. In 1912 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himara_revolt_of_1912) a small group of men, few days before Albania declares independence from the Ottoman Empire, hurry up and raise the Greek flag and a new vorioepirote flag (the latter one has both Greek flag elements (colors, pattern) and Albanian flag elements (double headed eagle)). They tried to create a new identity, Northern Epirus, part of Greece. They were unsuccessful though, as they did not get support from the population and Himara was joined to the rest of Albania, not Greece, or autonomous/independent. However, the struggle of these men and the state who financed them carries on. The propaganda continues, the separatist movement is alive. The census of 2011 clarifies the population composition though, only 24.56% declare themselves as Greek. Here included the ones that are 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 Greek in lineage. So, there is no Predominant Greek presence in Himara, predominant means 50% of the city + at least one more person. That is not the case, no matter what the greek state funded historians say, it is not more than 24.56%.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
It appears you are in a large scale ethnic campaign here, since Pettifer&Vickers; (Greek state funded historians? off course you are kidding) are clearly pro-Albanian authors, thus your claim can be easily dismissed. Moreover, you intentionally ignore the fact that this census was largely boycotted and the results do not reflect any real demographic values.

is a historian, ethnologist and demographer, and not to forget, a conspiracy theorist. We should believe everything he says, not. He claims that the 2011 census is the ""truth"", however, it is regarded by the Council of Europe as unreliable and inaccurate. No surprise.

<user_id=Burridheut>
Please put credible sources to your claims. Otherwise they constitute gossip. Disputed? Council of Europe? No surprise? You are too funny!
I am not on an ethnic campaign here (first difference between us two) and just to remind you, I was answering to a question made by  to the best of my personal knowledge. Be polite and keep your insults to yourself. Keep in mind that this discussion is about Spiro Koleka. You are dragging it into an ethnic, historic, folkloric discussion. No matter how amusing this is to you, the discussion still remains about Spiro Koleka. The census is official and your sources are inaccurate. Professor Pettifer may not be a Greek-founded historian, but the original source of information he is based upon with regards to Spiro Koleka's lineage for sure is. I sent him a letter yesterday to review his sources and I am hoping he will rectify this inaccuracy very soon. I want to remind you that my accuracy regarding Spiro Koleka's personal and family information has been so far 100% and fully documented by official records. Yours has been 0% and with little potential for improvement.

Elsie's bibliographical dictionary does state he was born in Vuno. Vuno is identified as a Orthodox Albanian speaking village within the wider Himara area (Nitsiakos, Vassilis (2010).

""According to the latest census in the area, the Greek-speaking population is larger but not necessarily continuous and concentrated.

Regarding Orthodox Albanian speaking people in general though as they have been “between identities” of either choosing the Albanian linguistic one over one that gives them religious commonalty with the Greeks (and thus a common ethnic identity according to some)  over the past 150 years, Koleka’s identification as “Greek” by Petiffer may(and I stress this word may) suffice. This matter is also interesting considering that Koleka is the uncle of Edi Rama. Spiro’s sister is Edi’s mum. Dare I say it, I wonder would we say that Edi Rama is a “Greek” too? Things to think about.

<user_id=Burridheut>
Resnjari, I need to reply to this. Speaking Greek does not make you Greek, just as speaking English does not make us British or American. Tomorrow perhaps our grandchildren will speak Mandarin, so it does not really tell much about someones lineage. Also when you mention Christian Orthodoxy it is important to emphasize that these is Albanian Orthodoxy and Greek Orthodoxy.They are not one and this is a very important distinction, although it might seem minor at fist sight. As you probably know, Albanians are not very religious people, so religion is not a good criteria to divide them in groups. There are exceptions to this though, but it is common to find Albanians of different religions and regions that have mixed with one another. Remember that Ali Pasha's wife Vasiliqi was Christian whereas he was muslim himself. Similar examples you will find everywhere and they are a sign of a modern society (signs of open-mindedness, tolerance, mobility). Coming back to the subject person. Spiro Thoma Koleka was not Greek, neither part of a minority. it will be impossible for anyone to prove Spiros Greek lineage because it is just a myth. For your info, it is very difficult to find an ethnic Greek (note the word Greek, I am not saying Greek speaking) in the village of Vuno. There are many in Dhermi and in some neighborhoods of the other villages, but in Vuno there are more polar bears than ethnic Greeks! Until recently many Albanians have taken the Greek passport because it was very convenient to be a member of the EU if you are Albanian. You got to travel freely, work in the EU area, get state assistance in case of unemployment, healthcare covered etc. So, for a poor Albanian working all day for 300€ a month, it was not a bad thing to have an additional passport. Also many older people have gotten a Greek passport and get a free pension that is higher than the average salary in Albania (no wonder how the Greek state has a black hole of 300 Billion Euros, they have been giving away free money all over the place). Anyway, getting the passport does not make you ethnic Greek, it just makes you ALSO a Greek CITIZEN, besides Albanian. Dual citizenship in Albania is allowed, so who am I to say that it is bad. The law is clear, the state does not care, the economy is bad, so people survive with what they can.

<user_id=Burridheut>
Last but not least. Edi Rama's mother is Aneta, but she is not Spiro's sister. Spiro's sister died in 1941 during the Greco-Italian war, so yes, she died 74 years ago at the age of 45. She would have been 119 years old if she was alive today so she is far from being even the same generation as Aneta. The whole point with Zoupan's persistence of Spiro's ""greekness"" is to invent a Greek lineage of the current prime minister of Albania. This is his agenda, it is not hidden as he has written about it himself. But the truth is that there is no such lineage whatsoever. We could talk more about the prime minister, his mother etc., but I am afraid that this is beyond the topic at hand, i.e. Spiro Koleka.

<user_id=Burridheut>
Also, Edi Rama is not a descendant of Spiro. They are part of the same family tree though.

<user_id=Burridheut>
, sorry but you got it wrong again. Please do not use online gossip-newspapers a sources, as they are even more inaccurate. In addition, if you have a look at the article you refer to, you will see in the top of it a writing in bold that says ""Spekullim"" meaning ""Speculation"" in Albanian. But seriously, refrain from using these references, they are not historic, but purely speculative. Edi Rama is not the grandson of Spiro. Regarding the peer reviewed material, thanks for the source.

<user_id=Resnjari>
Do you have some kind of biography or something in Albanian that could be used as a source/s for Spiro Koleka. Vickers and Pettifer are at times ""loose with the facts"" when it comes to many issues (not just this one). So are some of the other authors who state that Sprio was born in Himara  town. They have conflated the region which at times is called Himara with the town, which makes those sources also have credibility issues. Now you got me curious though Burridheut, how is Edi related to Spiro (a great nephew, cousin etc)?

<user_id=Resnjari>
Its why i used that in the talk page, not the article. A sizable number of Albanian outlets have made that claim though.

<user_id=Zoupan>
Nitsiakos also states that Orthodox Albanians in general where confused about their identity, the later stages of the nineteenth century (Nitsiakos. ''On the border''. 2010. p. 153. “The influence of Hellenism on the Albanian Orthodox was such that, when the Albanian national idea developed, in the three last decades of the 19th century, they were greatly confused regarding their national identity.)”. As in your comment that Nitsiakos states that some people identify as Northern Epirote is problematic, especially regarding Vuno. He also has stated that some Muslims also identify with that tag. In the book ''On the border'' he has made the reference that when Orthodox Albanians said some of that ""Northern Epriote"" stuff to him, they where playing around with it and being ambivalent (p.315. Those who live in Greece describe themselves as Greeks from Northern Epirus, while those who stayed in Albania are integrated into the Albanian Christian Orthodox population; after 1990 the “play” with the ambivalence of the term “Northern Epirote”; in Greece to be “Northern Epirote” means to be Greek.) Be aware of that too in current day contexts. I also have the book. There has been no wide ranging study about the changes that have occurred in southern Albania due to migration to Greece, the church run by a Greek hierarchy and so on. Kallivretakis is the last peer reviewed study of that kind and it was done in the 1990s.  As for Greek sources mentioning Vuno supporting Greek bands. True. Muslim Albanian ones supported Ottoman ones. So. Did people in Vuno solely do so because they ''felt'' ""ethnically"" Greek or because they felt a kinship due to shared Orthodoxy? A similar question could be asked of Muslim Albanians of the time. Also, parts of the Himara area was Albanianised as much as it was Hellenised. Greek schools operated in Orthodox Albanian villages in the latter part of the 19th century. Greek identity as understood today amongst them was not present prior to these events of the late nineteenth century. Being identified as Greek just meant Orthodox in past times. In the age of nationalisms, it acquired new national affiliation overtones.  The only Greek speaking villages in the area were and are Dhermi, Himara, Palasa and one of the Qeparo's. Edi Rama is also a descendant of Spiro.

<user_id=Burridheut>
Sorry, Vuno never had a Greek identity. It had some grecophiles back then, and it still has, although small in number. All of them are Albanian though. You must understand that the largest part of the population in Vuno has lived in survival conditions for many many years. Perhaps you don't know this, but the village has suffered the lack of drinking water and also the food was scarce. The number of men migrating away from Vuno towards Greece, Italy or elsewhere was very high. The village was not big enough to have a sustainable and thriving economy, without its immigrants it was unable to survive. I don't think that anyone living in Greece would have wanted to migrate to Vuno. To put it nicely, it would not have been an upgrade of their living conditions.

<user_id=Burridheut>
I don't have a biography at this moment about Spiro. It will be published sometime though. The publication will include our family tree from 1560, there you will see also where Edi Rama and other important figures of the past fit. For now I would like not to spoil that publication, I hope you understand. Spiro Koleka was a man too important not to be written about, but also to be written inaccurately about. That is why I insist in correcting this article and will do so until it is accurate for the public. The inaccuracies about Himara and Vuno are appalling as well. As you point out, Himara is not just a city but a whole Region including the villages around it. There are strong interests to call Himara Greek. The Greek state has thrown countless millions of euros to ""buy"" the history of Himara by giving pensions, passports, benefits but also by political intimidation towards the weak Albanian state (Greece is part of the EU, as we know). In some villages of Himara the presence of grecophiles has increased over the years, many people have acquired Greek names and passports, however their family roots are very easy to uncover and the absolute majority is Albanian. As a proof that Spiro was not greek, please refer to his Gravestone picture (http://i.imgur.com/pAJ5FLt.jpg). His name is not written in Greek (Σπύρος) form and alphabet, but in Albanian. So his fathers name, written as Thoma and not Θωμάς. So the surname. All Albanian. If you want to see a Greek gravestone and with what letters it is written then see here (http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KBnct994Yxk/UCjG1DmELvI/AAAAAAAAIRQ/h5E9XQj-gUc/s1600/391472_410321965692444_693399495_n.jpg). The difference is really easy to spot.

<user_id=Zoupan>
The fact that his name is written in Albanian on his gravestone does not refute a Greek background, after all, he was Hoxha's minister (a communist).

<user_id=Burridheut>
Is ""Greek background"" your latest version now? You have written in the article that he was born in a ""Greek FAMILY""! Do you even know the difference between your two claims? Or it just does not matter for you since the whole thing is made up? Why would (a so called Greek) communist have his name on his gravestone written in Albanian if he were a Greek? Communism is not an ethnicity! Do you really think that if he was democrat his name would have been written in Greek letters? LOL! What kind of twisted logic is that? He died in 2001, long time after communism and is buried in the graveyard of the Vuno village by his family. Go there and see the graves of the other people buried in the last two centuries, then come and tell us how many Greeks have lived in that village that you know nothing about.

<user_id=Resnjari>
Zoupan, in this exmaple as some sources state Koleka was born in the town of Himara, which is not the case, calls into doubt those sources as well about him being ''Greek''. The important question here is did Koleka identify himself as a Greek? Is there any evidence that he himself identified with the Greek minority ? I ask this because Greek editors have often put this question to Albanian editors regarding some figures who have some connection with Albanian identity, culture language etc but have identified as Greek and called themselves as such. Is there a credible source that states Koleka identified as a Greek (considering that his birthplace Vuno is inhabited by Orthodox Albanians or Orthodox Albanian speakers) ?

<user_id=Zoupan>
Note that the references were published during his lifetime. The doubting is implausible - Vuno is directly connected to Himara, being the nearest village. I don't think that the ""important question"" is his identity – him having belonged to the Greek community does not refute his Albanianess (Albanian nationality, service to Albanian state, etc.), which Burridheut seems to misunderstand, and you are now hinting at. As said previously, he was born in 1908; if this village did not espouse a Greek identity at that time should be easier for you to find out. The Greek school (1909), Greek rebel bands, and Greek toponym (''vouno'', ""mountain"") are evidence of Greek presence, thus I deem your continued insistence of having this fact removed as baseless. 1908 is not today. Vuno, being outside the Minority Zone, was without a doubt Albanianized since incorporation in Albania. Overall, there are few sources mentioning Koleka. I thought you were far more reasonable than other Albania-editing users. Hypothetically, an ""Albanian identity"" while still being of ""Greek identity"" origin would not determine that the latter be omitted from a biography.

<user_id=Burridheut>
You can speculate as much as you want but you will make neither Spiro nor Vuno & Himara more Greek by repeating yourself indefinitely. There is no evidence about Spiro's Greek-community belonging. All you have is Pettifer that says Spiro was ethnic Greek. Where did Pettifer get the facts about Spiro? Only God knows. I invite you to check the website of the Vuno village and see for yourself http://vunovillage.com/vunoi

<user_id=Burridheut>
There is some interesting quote by Edward Lear there: I was very surprised by the buildings in Vuno, such as the Kasneci one. They give you the feeling of Venetian “Palazzi”, as well as other constructions around rural area in Italy. The people of Himara use the Italian language more than anyone in Albania. In every village of this region I went, I noticed that despite the fact that they are Greek orthodox by religion, they are all Albanians, with some small exceptions.

<user_id=Burridheut>
Also, Zoupan, better not mention the Greek school of Vuno from 1909 as it is too recent, the school building itself in Vuno (still standing) is more than 200 years old! There are historic records of Albanian schools in Himara since 1627, in Vuno and Palasa since 1632 and Dhërmi since 1660. A bit weird that your greek school opened 280 years later, since you claim Himara to be PREDOMINANTLY Greek. As I said since this discussion started, this is purely separatist Greek propaganda.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
Until Burridheut conveices Vickers & Petiffer that they are wrong and the latter publish their apology that Koleka isn't of Greek origin as they claim, the current version stays in this article. In general everything else is clear manipulation of sourced content. Burridheut should repsect wp:rs instead of promoting conspiracy theories of supposed Greek-funded institutions that insist to falsify history.

<user_id=Resnjari>
For one toponyms are not indicative of a village's ethnicity. Greece has many villages that have a Slavic etymology. Are they Slavic on that account? Of course Vuno is directly connected to Himara, but it is a settlement in its own right. The matter is the authors have not distinguished Himara town from Himara region. They specifically say that Koleka was from Himara town. That already calls into question the sources credibility at the very least. As for Greek bands operating in Orthodox Albanian speaking regions, it happened all over the place. How is that indicative that the village being ""Greek"". In Macedonia, there were many cases where Greek bands went into Slavic villages coercing them to side with Greek cause (see: Anastasia Karakasidou: 'Fields of wheat, hills of Blood' book). How is one Greek in that case? During that era, as Nitsiakos clearly states, Orthodox Albanians were confused in the latter part of the 19th century regarding their identity, due in part to the emergence of the national Albanian movement. Interpreting that they are Greek, one must be very cautious about it, as Greek apart from ethnic connotations also meant just ""Orthodox"". It would be important in this case to have a source where Koleka himself identified as Greek to prove the issue beyond doubt. Otherwise in the article it should state that ""according to some sources it states that Koleka was of Greek heritage"", considering that they have mixed up Himara region with town, getting Koleka's birthplace wrong. One in this case can ask what else have they got wrong?

<user_id=Burridheut>
And who exactly do you think you are to decide what stays and what goes??? If an information is inaccurate it cannot stay. Spiro was not born in a Greek family , there is no shred of evidence supporting this. Not a single historic document. I sent an email to Prof. Petiffer to check his sources, but I have no authority over that man. Maybe he rectifies it, maybe he issues a note, but maybe he never publishes anything else mentioning Spiro Koleka! So what does that mean? Does that make Spiro Greek? Don't be ridiculous! Btw. you seem to have a lot of problems here on wikipedia with several users complaining about your propaganda edits. Can't you just report facts and leave fiction out of here?

<user_id=Alexikoua>
If someone has a background of X ethnicity this doesn't mean he is an X national/citizen, see for example Prs. Obama. I'm afraid that by not convincing the author this can't be removed. However, if you can find wp:rs which claims something different we can add that ""he is of Greek family background according to Pettifer and of another background by another author.""

<user_id=Rolandi+>
I don't think that Koleka was Greek.However,there is a reference so we have to respect that.As Alexikoua said,If someone has a background of X ethnicity this doesn't mean he is an X national/citizen,see for example Arvanites.They have Greek citizenship now,but they are Albanians by ancestry.
In one of her books,Iliriana Koleka (his daughter) says that their family originates from Vuno.In fact,while speaking for their origin,she doesn't mention any Greece.

<user_id=Resnjari>
Due to the Orthodox Albanians and their identity fluidity or issues with identity in general, Koleka is complicated. Alexikoua's is right about adding multiple views regarding Koleka's identity would suffice. Rolandi, do  you have Iliriana's book and page number as to where she talks about their family origins. Her bit would more than count into going into the article.

<user_id=Burridheut>
Obama is not the same story I am afraid. Obama has a parent that is African and you can trace him. Spiro has no one you can trace in Greece. Look at the surname, it is not Greek. If you can prove that he is even 25% of Greek origin I will withdraw. But if you cannot, then this inaccuracy is removed. In addition I would like you all to remember one simple fact. I posted Spiros marriage certificate here! I AM FAMILY! How do you think I got his certificate? Do you think I broke into his house and stole it just to win an argument over the internet against anonymous people??? Why don't you use logic? If I challenge your sources then you have to look into them. The information inside the sources about Spiro is not referenced!!! It is neither scientific or based on historical records. How can you insist so much in it just because Petiffer says so? This is a disgrace to humanity and I appeal to your conscience and do the right thing. I challenge your sources!

<user_id=Alexikoua>
I wonder what makes wp:rs a newspaper-organ of a political party, such as this one. Actually such evidence is the definition of non-rs, which can't refute secondary reliable material.

<user_id=Burridheut>
Very well, I see you are able to make a distinction among the reliability of sources. But here is another publication, this one is the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Albania, see bottom right of page: http://imgur.com/f7kLRxs

<user_id=Burridheut>
UPDATE!: , , , , . I found an article about Spiro Koleka written right after his death about his life. The article is written in the newspaper ""Zëri i së Vertetës"", issue of September 2001 (http://imgur.com/vYUkz1d). The article is signed by 9 people, members of the Communist Party of Albania. In the article it is written among other things: 1. Spiro Koleka was born in Vuno. 2. Born in a family of highly patriotic history (Greece loses Spiro here, he remains an Albanian Patriot after all.)

<user_id=Resnjari>
, do you have access to books and so on about Vuno that where written in a post communist period (1992 onwards) (During communism sources are an issue due to the communist state having overarching influence in some of the literary material produced during that time. That would be the best and most authoritative source regarding the matter in placing an alternate view regarding Koleka's ethnicity. No one would be able to challenge that going into the article. Find the page in those books about Koleka being Albanian. Then write that out here, the page and the few sentences that deal with that and then we can put into the article. Makes things easier for everyone.

<user_id=Burridheut>
there are not many books written about Spiro Koleka in post-communism time. I have one more article though, published after his death in 2001. The article is written by Anastas Kondo, also from Vuno, a very close friend and colleague of Spiro koleka. Read here: http://imgur.com/mAN9iW1 and here: http://imgur.com/gz1Srfm . Please remember that Spiro was not an important figure during post-communist time and he was in his 80s and 90s, so not an active politician anymore. However, you need to know that Spiro Was alive in 1985 when the Encyclopedia was published and has not protested for any inaccuracy.

<user_id=Burridheut>
I will need to explain here that although I am providing articles and links, I do not have to prove what this man WAS NOT something. The ones who claim that they know what he was have to show the proof. As a thinking experiment, just to make my point clear: can you prove that any X adult person is not a criminal? Impossible! You can never prove that! However, the burden of proof is on anyone saying that he IS, so they need to prove that Mr/Mrs. X is indeed such a person, before he is labeled something. This is how every modern justice system works. You have to prove WHAT IS, NOT WAS ISN'T! Anyone claiming that Spiro was Greek has to find a proof. And this is especially important for historians. Otherwise this is just malicious propaganda or pure speculation.

<user_id=Alexikoua>
It appears I was not precise enough. If you present an wp:rs, as you have done with a tertiary encyclopedia above, this isn't a reason to remove the already existent reference. All alternative theories can be part of this article: in this case, Pettifer&Vickers; claim a Greek origin, while the Encyclopedia X claims he is of Albanian patriotic background (X claims Y & Z claim W).

<user_id=Alexikoua>
Guess it needs more serious arguments than this one []. I hope this doesn't mean that Vickers should be entirely removed as an wp:rs from wikipedia.

",1,"Chain-of-Thoughts reasoning:

1. The discussion revolves around the ethnic background of Spiro Koleka and whether he should be identified as Greek or Albanian in the Wikipedia article. The main sources of contention are references by Pettifer & Vickers, who claim Greek origin, and an Encyclopedic Dictionary of Albania, which suggests an Albanian patriotic background.

2. User <user_id=Burridheut> presents a personal connection to the subject, claiming to be family and having access to personal documents like marriage certificates. This user insists on the Albanian identity of Spiro Koleka and challenges the Greek identity assertion by providing evidence from the family's perspective and historical context.

3. User <user_id=Alexikoua> argues for the inclusion of Pettifer & Vickers' viewpoint based on the principle of respecting reliable sources. This user suggests that until the authors are convinced otherwise and publish a retraction or correction, their viewpoint should remain in the article.

4. User <user_id=Resnjari> brings up the importance of post-communist sources and the need for evidence that Koleka identified himself as Greek. This user also suggests that multiple views on Koleka's identity should be included in the article.

5. The discussion includes references to historical events, demographic changes, and the influence of national identity on the region of Himara. There is a debate on the reliability of sources, with some users questioning the credibility of certain authors and others defending their work.

6. The argument quality varies among users. Some arguments are based on personal claims and anecdotal evidence, while others rely on published sources and the principles of Wikipedia's reliable sourcing. There is a mix of factual discussion, personal bias, and attempts to interpret historical evidence.

7. The discussion also touches on the broader issue of national identity and how it can be influenced by various factors, including language, religion, and political movements. This adds complexity to the debate and requires careful consideration of multiple perspectives.

8. Overall, the discussion shows an engagement with the topic and an attempt to reconcile different viewpoints. However, the quality of arguments is uneven, with some users providing more substantiated claims than others.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

presidential campaign of transhumanist candidate

<user_id=Jytdog>
this is one of the most WP:OFFTOPIC, WP:COATRACK edits i have ever seen in Wikipedia. reverted.

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
I apologize if the information is off-topic. I honestly thought that it was on topic, since the candidate's main issue seems to be transhumanism with a heavy focus on life extension. Will you help me understand why this is irrelevant?
Also, I did not mean to detract the section from the politics of life extension. Is there a way that I can reword this information so that it does not make the article seem like a ""coatrack""?

<user_id=Ronz>
Seems undue and well into WP:SOAP territory. If something comes of it in the future we should add it as a part of whatever makes it noteworthy.

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
Does just one sentence really count as undue? The information has already received significant media attention, and it is displayed on other parts of Wikipedia. At what point will it count as having something come of it for the purposes of this page, and how is that decision made?
Also, it is a just factual statement that does not advocate anything, influence attitudes about something, recruit anyone, display opinion, gossip about scandal, promote myself, try to sell something, or act on behalf of an organization. Given this, I do not see how your linked policy is relevant. Can you explain?

<user_id=Ronz>
Yes, one sentence can be undue. He's definitely using the topic to promote himself and his interests. Further, politics is often used for cheap pr purposes. Given the nature of the sources, their content, and the history of political campaigning being used solely for promotional purposes, I think it falls well into SOAP.

<user_id=Ronz>
it is a just factual statement: Nothing is just a factual statement. Everything we include in our articles falls under NPOV. Some information just isn't noteworthy, some barely so. Some information serves purposes that contradict the goals and interests of this encyclopedia.

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
I suspect that everyone campaigning for political office promotes themselves and their interests to some degree. However, I do not think that he is using life extension to promote himself as much as he is using himself to promote life extension. Regardless, ""WP:SOAP"" does not apply to Istvan's words off of Wikipedia. Actually, it does not apply here at all, because ''the content that I added'' does not violate this policy, as ''the content itself'' is not advocacy, propaganda, recruitment, et cetera. In fact, according to the policy, an article ""can report objectively ''about'' such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view"", which is precisely what my content did.

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
What I meant by it being a ""factual statement"" is that it is either true or false and does not express opinion. The real contention here seems to be about whether the content has a neutral point of view. Since it does not express a viewpoint, the only relevant part of Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy that I noticed is the small section on balancing aspects, which says to ""strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to the weight of that aspect in the body of reliable sources on the subject."" Let us then review the body of sources about the presidential campaign:
're:form''
'ExtremeTech''
'National Review''
'Business Insider''
'Wired''
'The Telegraph''
'Heise Online''
'Reason''
Roland Benedikter in ''The Leftist Review''
'Humanity+''
'Psychology Today''
'Motherboard''
'The Huffington Post''
'Gizmodo''
'Popular Science''
'Esquire''
'Stanford Political Journal''
Is this enough for one sentence? I suspect that there is other information on the life extension page that does not have this much coverage. Of course, some of the authors of the above sources are biased, but they are still reliable for this information, which is not an opinion or contentious claim.

<user_id=Ronz>
Thanks for all the potential refs. I don't have time atm to go through them all. If we put aside for now the interviews, puff-pieces, and human interest stories, what do we have left?

<user_id=Jytdog>
''no'''. the presidential candidacy has '''nothing''' to do with the subject of life extension outside of POV-pushing for a Transhumanist agenda. Stop abusing WP as a WP:SOAPBOX. It is a bad thing to do.

<user_id=Ronz>
'(edit conflict)'' Of those left from my question, which of them discuss life extension, the topic of this article, in any degree of detail? If none, then it's probably not worth mention.

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
There are articles that include interviews in that list, but they are not ''only'' interviews: they also include reliable background information. I did not notice any exaggerated praise in any of the articles, so I did not see any puff pieces. Also, I did not notice any of them describing Istvan in a way to bring sympathy to him or inspiration from him, so I do not think that any are human interest stories.

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
Regardless of the motives, the fact that life extension is one of the main issues of an American presidential candidate is clearly relevant to life extension. Since all I did was mention this fact, free of advocacy or opinion, I do not understand how I violated the soapbox policy. Can you please quote which part I violated?

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
Excluding any interviews within the articles, 12 or 13 out of 17 mention life extension. The weight of the link between the candidacy and life extension looks clear to me.

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
I have never advocated transhumanism on Wikipedia. Making neutral statements about a topic is not advocacy. Please let me give you a friendly reminder to be polite, assume good faith, and avoid personal attacks.

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
Anyway, whether or not a person is popular, a simple sentence about their political emphasis on life extension is of course pertinent to a section on the politics of life extension, given that it is written in a neutral point of view and backed by several reliable sources. I see that the article is largely about science, but there are also many sections about other aspects of life extension, such as public opinion, the history of its movement, and ethics regarding it. If you want to move these to their own article, then I would probably support you.

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
I never claimed that the candidate is affecting the race, so there is no need for a source saying this. Most things on Wikipedia do not have a source like the New York Times, so that standard is obviously too high – a plethora of other reliable sources such as the list above should do. Actually, mention of the Transhumanist Party, its candidate, and its policies (including life extension) are already on Wikipedia. Why, then, should one small remark about them not be here, too?

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
I am sorry to hear that you are choosing ignorance over discussion. However, since you refuse to listen to me on this topic or discuss why I am wrong, then I hope you will not try to revert any similar edits in the future.

<user_id=Jytdog>
If you are such intense advocate for trashumanism that you cannot see that mention of a FRINGE political candidate in an article about the science around extending life is completely UNDUE, you probably should not be editing Wikipedia.  You need to check your ideology at the WP log in page.  I am going to ignore further discussion of this until you bring a source like NYT that gives substantial discussion to this.  That source will need to show that the candidate is actually affecting the race and that life extension is one of the key reasons why. Otherwise this is a complete waste of time.

<user_id=Jytdog>
My comments above are based on your continuing to insist that this content should be in this article at this time. Continuing. Zoltan himself says ""We've got another 14 months to go before we have to concede or something like that. Of course, I stand almost no chance of winning the 2016. But, I have been working, and I discussed this with my wife before I even started the campaign, that the real goal is to try to work and build the Transhumanist Party so that it has a much better shot at 2020 and 2024.""  Wikipedia is not a place to build the party.

If none of the proposed sources discusses life extension in any depth, then we've little or no context from which to determine what would be appropriate due weight. Balancing that against he SOAP problems, I think there's a good case for keeping it out.

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
I completely agree. We should keep political recruitment off of Wikipedia. Let us keep all content about politics neutral, as my edit was.

<user_id=Jytdog>
nobody but an advocate for transhumanist politics would think this FRINGE political campaign worthy of mention in this article about health. you ''are'' the one introducing politics.

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
There are no ""SOAP"" problems here. The policy actually explicitly allows neutral comments about advocacy and recruitment, such as my own.

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
Regarding weight, the sources do discuss life extension at depth. Let me give you some quotes.
The piece from ''The Telegraph'' has a lengthy paragraph on just life extension:
The discussion with political analyst Roland Benedikter in the ''Heise Online'' article is difficult for me to parse, because I cannot read German, though he seems to talk about life extension multiple times. However, his interview in ''Leftist Review'' is in English. In that article, he identifies ""three important developmental steps, that some consider milestones on the way to 'transhumanism'"". The first, he says, is Google's Calico project. He has this to say:
The second identified step is the United States's BRAIN initiative. The third, he says, is Istvan's Transhumanist Party. Benedikter states:
It admittedly takes a bit of synthesis to connect Istvan's party to Calico's mission, but combining this information with that of the other sources makes the link clear.
The ''Popular Science'' states this:
More depth is reached in the interviews with Istvan. I agree that less weight should be given to his words, but they are not weightless, as the interviews are conducted and curated by professional journalists and published in reliable publications under editorial oversight – the staff choose what to publish. Even articles by Istvan him should be considered, because (for better or for worse) they still drive public awareness and conversation.
Is this not enough for one mention in passing?

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
My character is irrelevant, because I am not advocating politics on Wikipedia. Please refrain from ''ad hominem'' attacks. Let me quote Wikipedia's ""no personal attacks"" policy:

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
I only introduced politics insofar as neutrally mentioning political subjects, which is explicitly allowed in Wikipedia's soapbox policy.

<user_id=Jytdog>
I completely understand why you are saying that. I work on Conflict of interest and advocacy issues across Wikipedia, and I understand why you are saying that.  But what you are not hearing, is that your advocacy is causing a problem here. I will take this up with you further on your talk page, which is indeed a more appropriate venue.

<user_id=Haptic-feedback>
Again, I have never advocated politics or transhumanism on Wikipedia. The only thing that I am advocating here is adherence to Wikipedia's guidelines, which your comments have breached but not mine.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Relevance of the Edit: The primary point of contention is whether the mention of a transhumanist presidential candidate's campaign is relevant to the Wikipedia article on life extension. Haptic-feedback argues that it is relevant because the candidate's main issue is transhumanism with a focus on life extension. Jytdog and Ronz argue that it is off-topic and a form of advocacy or promotion, which is against Wikipedia's policies.

2. Wikipedia Policies: Both sides reference various Wikipedia policies to support their arguments. Haptic-feedback cites WP:SOAPBOX to argue that the content added was neutral and factual, not advocacy. Jytdog and Ronz argue that the edit falls under WP:UNDUE and WP:SOAP, suggesting that it gives undue weight to a fringe topic and serves promotional purposes.

3. Sources and Notability: Haptic-feedback provides a list of sources that mention the candidate and life extension, arguing that this coverage justifies a single sentence in the article. Jytdog and Ronz question the depth and quality of these sources, suggesting that many may not be substantial enough to warrant inclusion.

4. Tone and Conduct: Throughout the discussion, Haptic-feedback maintains a polite tone and repeatedly asks for clarification on policy violations, emphasizing adherence to Wikipedia's guidelines. Jytdog's tone becomes more confrontational, suggesting that Haptic-feedback's advocacy is causing problems and that they should not be editing Wikipedia if they cannot see the fringe nature of the content. Ronz remains more neutral, focusing on the policy and content aspects without personal attacks.

5. Argument Quality: Haptic-feedback's arguments are well-structured, citing specific policies and providing evidence from multiple sources. The user also attempts to engage in a constructive dialogue by asking for specific feedback on policy violations. Jytdog and Ronz provide less detailed reasoning, focusing more on the assertion that the content is fringe and promotional without as much detailed reference to policy or engagement with the sources provided by Haptic-feedback.

Overall, the quality of the discussion is mixed. Haptic-feedback provides a reasoned argument with evidence and a respectful tone, while Jytdog and Ronz provide less detailed reasoning and, in Jytdog's case, a more confrontational tone. The discussion could be improved with more focus on policy details and source evaluation from all parties, as well as maintaining a respectful and constructive tone throughout.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

<user_id=Medeis>
The 2013 seizure section quotes only one party, directly or indirectly, Preet Bharara's office.  We don't even have a notion where the CEO is being held, whether his defense has made a statement, or if he even has a defense.
Every single statement and quote in the May 2013 section of the article issues directly from the prosecutor, Preet Bharara. The $45 million dollar scheme is attributed to two Dutchmen arrested by German authoritieswe have only Bharara' allegation that Liberty's involvement with that scheme was criminal as opposed to incidental, not any other source's. This entire section amounts to ""Preet Bharara"" says. That is the essence of POV.
We need independent statements, down even to a statement as to where the suspects are, and who is representing them.

<user_id=Medeis>
Note that every single quote in this section regarding Liberty and Budovsky is attributed to Federal prosecutor US Attorney Preet Bharara or his office, directly, or as a source in the references.  Note that the two claims not going directly to him, that the website has been taken down, and that two Dutchmen were arrested in Germany earlier this month are not evidence of crime on the company's part.
In May 2013 U.S. '''prosecutors''' filed a case against Liberty Reserve, alleging it had handled $6 billion of criminal proceeds.
Arthur Budovsky was arrested '''by police''' in Spain and the site was taken offline and replaced with a notice saying the domain had been ""'''seized by the United States''' Global Illicit Financial Team.""
Liberty Reserve itself was accused by '''U.S. prosecutors''' of moving tens of millions of dollars through shell accounts.
Forty-five bank accounts were seized or restricted by '''United States federal prosecutors''' under the Patriot Act as a result of the investigation.
The '''United States attorney''' in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, stated the case ""may be the largest international money laundering case ever brought by the United States."" ""The global enforcement action we announce today is an important step towards reining in the 'Wild West' of illicit Internet banking."" '''Bharara''' said. ""As crime goes increasingly global, the long arm of the law has to get even longer, and in this case, it encircled the earth.""
One specific allegation of the '''prosecutors''' is that the site played a role in laundering the $45 million stolen from the Bank of Muscat and the National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah in May 2013.The sum of $45 million was reported stolen from the Bank of Muscat and the National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah earlier in the month -

<user_id=ThaddeusB>
You are mistaken.  Some of the info comes from Costa Rican authorities (for example: ""In 2011, Liberty Reserve was denied a business license in Costa Rica"" and ""The business formally disbanded at that time, but company founder Arthur Budovsky continued to operate the business by funneling it through five other Costa Rican businesses, according to authorities"") and 3rd parties (Brian Krebs).  Also I don't know why you insist on tagging ""Arthur Budovsky was arrested by police in Spain"" with .  Do you wnat the name of the arresting officer or something?

<user_id=Medeis>
He's not being arrested by Costa Rican authorities on Costa Rican charges, but on behalf of America.  It's entirely relevant by whom he was arrested in Spain, and on what charges.  Local police?  Interpol?  US authorities in Spain?

<user_id=ThaddeusB>
Which would mean their ""testimony"" is independent of the US government and thus a third party source, which is exactly what you seem to want...  Why does it matter who did the physical arresting? It was obviously done on the authority of the US indictment, and the charges are already in the article.

<user_id=Medeis>
First, let me say that the arresting party is important, but not problematic as far as the NPOV status of the article goesit's simply a separate matter that needs addressing.  Who has arrested him physically and on what actual charge is highly important in American law.  He has the right to legal counsel, to be advised in court of the charges brought against him, and of habeas corpus meant to force authorities to reveal where he's being held.  If he's been arrested by Spanish or Interpol or other authorities that's an entirely different story.  Are we to presume, for example, that he has the right to contest extradition?  Or was a deal made ahead of time infringing on that right?  We wouldn't accept it if authorities reported in the passive voice that he was shot during an investigation.  Legally, knowing who arrested him and under what circumstances is as vital as knowing who shot him would be.

<user_id=Medeis>
As for third party sources and NPOV, any journalist reporting where he is being held, and that he has talked with Budovsky, a statement from Budovsky himself, or his lawyer, or from a third party governmental authority reporting he's being held somewhere by someone on what charges would be helpful. Obviously I can't say ahead of time what would be balancing.  But at this point we might as well have Tony Soprano telling us, ""He broke da rules and we got him and we gonna punish him for his crimes, trust us""? The last thing we need to do is collude in presenting only one side about this person accused of a crime and protected by WP:BLP.

<user_id=ThaddeusB>
You know as well as I do that such information does not (yet) exist.  Once it does, we certainly should include it but that does not mean the article is not neutral (by Wikipedia's definition as is.  From WP:N: ""Editing from a neutral point of view (NPOV) means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources.""  That is what the article does - it presents ""all"" the RS published views.  At this time, there is only one such view. The fact that RS have presented only one side of the story means we can only present that one side. To do otherwise would, in fact, violate NPOV.

<user_id=Medeis>
The question here is the perp walk.  When the cops seize their suspects at six in the morning, undressed, chain them all together in orange jumpers and parade them openly before the press in a prearranged production.  Does facilitating that amount to NPOV and BLP?  Is the fact we're in a rush to get somethingour equivalent of profita good reason to compromise such principles?  A lot of news outlets gave up the perp walk in the 90's as prejudicial in the us, and as a way the state corrupted the press and the truth.  What we have now is a ll perp walk, with the perps hidden incommunicado off stage, and the state speaking on their behalf.  We're not junkies looking for a fix.  We don't need to compromise our NPOV and BLP safeguards to make a quick buck.  WE can wait til the other side of the story comes out, the defense, the plea, the as of now hidden details.  Wikipedia won't break.  It'll be better.

<user_id=ThaddeusB>
The problem with the tag, from my point of view, is that it is a call to fix things but there is not actually anything wrong ''by policy'' here.  What you want to happen is reasonable, but currently impossible.  The article should not be tagged as needing fixed when what you want added can't be added - the info simply does not exist.  What you or I ''think'' about the US government's actions and/or the reporting of the story is not relevant.  All we can do is say the accusations are accusations. I suppose we could add a sentence that Budovsky and the other accused have declined to comment, but I doubt that will allay your concerns.

<user_id=ThaddeusB>
He was arrested by ordinary Spanish police.  I have edited the article accordingly.

<user_id=LukeSurl>
This seems to be an issue you believe ''the world'' is POV, not Wikipedia. I reiterate ThaddeusB's point that we can't tag an article for not including information that ''doesn't yet exist''. Tags are for issues that are possible to be resolved - this seems to be a tag of protest at non-Wikipedia circumstances.

<user_id=Medeis>
With further details of his arrest coming from Spanish and Costa Rican authorities, my concern that the only source we had for his circumstances was the US prosecutor has been addressed.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Medeis raises concerns about the neutrality of an article, pointing out that the information comes predominantly from the U.S. prosecutor's office and lacks input from the defense or independent sources. This is a valid point in terms of ensuring a balanced and neutral point of view in the article.

2. User ThaddeusB responds by indicating that some information does come from Costa Rican authorities and third-party sources, which would provide some balance. ThaddeusB also questions the relevance of the exact identity of the arresting officers, suggesting that the authority behind the arrest (the U.S. indictment) is more pertinent to the article.

3. User Medeis counters by emphasizing the legal importance of knowing who made the arrest and under what circumstances, as it can affect the rights of the accused, such as the right to contest extradition. This is a relevant point in terms of legal accuracy and completeness of the information.

4. User ThaddeusB acknowledges that while the desired information does not yet exist, the article should reflect all views that have been published by reliable sources. ThaddeusB suggests that the article is neutral by Wikipedia's standards because it presents all the information that is currently available from reliable sources.

5. User Medeis argues that the article should not rush to present one side of the story and should wait for more information to ensure neutrality and adherence to Wikipedia's biography of living persons (BLP) policy. This is a strong argument for caution and thoroughness in reporting on legal matters.

6. User ThaddeusB updates the article with the information that the arrest was made by ordinary Spanish police, addressing one of Medeis's concerns about the details of the arrest.

7. User LukeSurl points out that Wikipedia cannot include information that does not exist and that tags should not be used to protest non-Wikipedia circumstances. This is a practical point about the limitations of what Wikipedia can include at any given time.

Overall, the discussion shows a thoughtful exchange of views on the importance of neutrality, the availability of information, and the policies of Wikipedia. Both parties present reasonable arguments, and there is a clear effort to address concerns and improve the article within the constraints of available information.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.",8.0
"<user_id=BatteryIncluded>
Relationship with Gaia theory

<user_id=BatteryIncluded>
Hello, I am a late comer in this discussion but I am somewhat literate in the subject. My impression is that the section ""Origins of Earth system science"" now accurately reflects the origin of ESS by acknowledging its foundations in the Gaia hypothesis. Where I see a hornet's nest with fuel to last is the section entitled ""Relationship to Gaia theory"". The POV, assessments and editorials shown there are simply not needed in Wikipedia; the statement has already been made in the section ""Origins of Earth system science"" that the Gaia theory was used for its foundation. The Gaia concept also evolved with time to conform 100% with the scientific terminology, so comparing them in parallel is a pissing match —evidenced in the talk page— not likely to stop any time soon. I strongly suggest to delete that section -while being aware of the hard work it took to reference those arguments.  Cheers,

<user_id=Terradactyl>
Hi, BatteryIncluded - Well, I certainly wasn't the first person to put material about Gaia into the entry. Note that for a year or two the entry had a section called ""Inspiration in the Gaia Hypothesis"" or something like that. It was then removed by Toby Tyrrell, of all people, with a note calling it irrelevant! Note above Prokaryote's talk about my recent edits adding back in material about the relationship with Gaia theory, as being ""against consensus,"" which is pure rubbish. Indeed, it is because of folks like himself, who have rendered the obvious into something to be considered ""controversial,"" that the entry demands a longer section to substantiate the facts in this ""controversy."" Keep in mind that if you look above you will note that Prokaryotes himself wrote that I should find citations from ""academic textbooks"" verifying the origins of ESS in Gaia theory, the importance of Gaia to ESS, etc, if I was to include this material. That's exactly what I did in the section ""Relationship to Gaia theory,"" and now that I went through the work, and given that the material is obviously accurate and clearly pertinent, I have asked for protection of the article, and will keep asking for it if editors keep removing good work of another editor instead of adding their own material that expresses some ""other side"" of this ""controversy"", if they feel that there are some points missing that need to be in there.

<user_id=Isambard Kingdom>
BI, I agree. I propose to save the citations to source material, but otherwise remove the section Relationship to Gaia theory.

<user_id=Prokaryotes>
Removed!

<user_id=BatteryIncluded>
Hello. It is unfortunate that the name ""Gaia"" drew the ''New Age'' crowd into the scientific discussions, because their context was quite different and that interfered with the scientific studies under that name. Had Lovelock  named it something like ""geophysiology"", it would have been a different story. Regarding this WP article, Gaia must/can figure as a prominent ""precursor"" of sorts in the historical context, as it is an article on ESS, not on Gaia or on the ESS-Gaia comparison.  Please feel free to review my edits keeping in mind there is an urgency to address the neutrality tag on top, and aim at removing it. Cheers,

<user_id=Terradactyl>
If they have some other point of view, they should feel free to express it! In fact, I'm not sure that there really is some ""other side"" here.

<user_id=Terradactyl>
Hi, BatteryIncluded - Btw, just to expand on the lack of appropriateness of what Prokaryotes et al are trying to do......this is what Wiki says:
''It is inappropriate to remove blocks of well-referenced information which is germane to the subject from articles on the grounds that the information advances a point of view. Wikipedia's NPOV policy contemplates inclusion of all significant points of view. [5]'''

<user_id=Terradactyl>
Hi, BatteryIncluded -
Well, at the moment, it seems to be more the rabid dying elements of hard-core Neo-Darwinists that are the problem, not New Age folks. Please note: the 'Origins section', as I created it, dealt only very briefly with Gaia theory, and then discussed, and focused on, the history of the first steps of ESS as its own independent thing, as opposed to Gaia theory. That's why the ""Relationship"" section is so vital - it isn't just a question of origins, it's more complicated than that, and the ""origins"" I meant were primarily those of ESS after its ""Inspiration in the Gaia theory,"" to quote from a section heading title of another editor.  To the extent that Gaia and ESS overlap or are even the same thing in essence today, it is extremely important to this article, if it is to have any intellectual honesty about it, that it discuss that fact, for reasons that remain obvious. That's why a section like the ""relationship"" one is clearly needed - and the sheer fact that Tyrrell removed all mention of Gaia from this article himself shows how important this is!

<user_id=Terradactyl>
In terms of the neutrality tag: I initially thought that it came up because of my complaints to the administrators, when I asked for protection. Then, still not knowing how NPOV disputes work, I began to wonder if it came from the other side, and one of these Neo-Darwinists like Toby Tyrrell making a complaint. Actually it was editor AnomieBot who added it. Please note what the neutrality tag asks for: as always at Wiki, it is NOT the destruction of good, well-cited, objective factual work that is pertinent, but the addition of OTHER material, if there is something being left out that renders the point of view unbalanced. It says:
''Please improve the article by ADDING information on neglected viewpoints'''

<user_id=Terradactyl>
I hope so much that if Prokaryotes keeps removing the Gaia material, which I worked on for a long time, even following some of his specific demands in executing it, and which is entirely relevant and important to this article, that you will revert his attacks upon the article! I will again try to get protection for the article. As mentioned, this material has been removed at least 6 times or so now, by a few aggressive editors, although I was not the first to include either a section on Gaia or the Amsterdam Declaration. What's most fascinating is that no one else bothered to trace the actual history of ESS, outside of the relationship to Gaia theory - I seem to be the only editor who has bothered to deal with that, curiously enough, almost as though these complaining editors don't actually care much about ESS, only about their dislike for ""Gaia."" In my opinion, someone like Prokaryotes is essentially incompetetent: he seems to have little concern with what is actually in the article, he only cares about what ISN'T in the article, and that has nothing to do with the Wiki philosophy. Prokaryotes has not only been blocked in the past, but he has also tried to evade his blocks with secondary accounts. This kind of aggressive destructive editing is a nuisance. So, please feel free to revert his subtractions (note above all that he never seems to add much of anything to it - try to find which material he initiated in the article - but is happy to subtract huge blocks of text by others), as they are primarily pernicious. Cheers,

<user_id=BatteryIncluded>
I see that the edit warring is intense, and so I will only make one additional observation: I think that the sources used by you, Terradactyl are correct and appropriate (undeniable that Gaia was key and seminal to ESS), but there is something to be said about your writing style that prompted me to want to delete that section. I see that there has been a long and frustrating edit war against user Toby Tyrrell who seemed inclined to 'supress' Gaia theory altogether, so Terradactyl countered with his referenced arguments in the body of the article. The outcome is that that section was created and written in the style of a debate rather than an encyclopedic summary. I propose: 1) that section to be shortened and re-written with an encyclopedic style. 2) Move the historical info into the ""Origins"" section, and 3) focus the comparison with what Gaia theory is today. Cheers,

<user_id=Plumbago>
If I can return to stick my oar in again. The original reverts by Toby Tyrrell (and, subsequently, myself) were to address an overemphasis on Gaia's ''current'' role in ESS. Gaia is of secondary importance in contemporary ESS research, and this is something I tried to illustrate above by looking on the Web of Science. That said, Gaia is certainly ''part'' of the history of ESS, and this should be represented here. However, it is also the case that much of contemporary ES modelling (the best example of systems science in a planetary context?) is borne out of extensions of long-standing weather and climate modelling that has gradually incorporated more and more aspects of the Earth system (e.g. the ocean, the terrestrial biota, marine biogeochemistry, the cryosphere, etc.). Gaia has, at best, only partially informed such work, and this is reflected in the relative lack of attention that Gaia receives in the scientific literature. It does still have its champions, and a number of them are prominent scientists, but it is not a hot mainstream topic, and its contribution to the history of ESS is not unequivocal. My issue here has been with Terradactyl's efforts to consistently overplay Gaia in ESS, not to expunge it.

<user_id=BatteryIncluded>
I agree in that this article is about ESS, so ESS has to be the only prominent subject. Gaia is noted as seminal or key. Cheers,

<user_id=Terradactyl>
I will actually do what BatteryIncluded suggests, but should probably just hit revert again. What Plumbago writes - and has been repeating for a long time - simply does not add up. He's saying that Gaia theory had a role in the past, but not the present, because no one ""in ESS"" (whatever that means) talks about Gaia. But he is wanting to keep out of the article the observation - made many times by others, including Lovelock himself, outside of the single citation I gave  -  that people do not talk about ""Gaia"" and use the term ""ESS"" instead simply to avoid the name ""Gaia"". That clearly changes things! And so the question here is, aside from dealing with the origins of the field, the actual contemporary relationship between ESS & Gaia, which, given the high profile of some of those who have said that they are identical, or nearly so, obviously is 100% required for any reasonably honest discussion about ESS!! Obviously, the reason that Tyrrell's expunging Gaia from this is not at all as Plumbago describes, and is tantamount to a crime within any reasonable world of scholarship, is that he makes money and a career and his reputation from the separation of these two things - as soon as one observes that these things, Gaia and ESS, are more or less identical, then his Gaia book isn't worth a dime! That you are openly supporting this kind of criminality is amazing.

<user_id=Terradactyl>
There is no question but that I have been the most objective editor of this entry - in terms of all the ""NPOV"" garbage, note that no one else editing this article ever put in any significant material ASIDE from Gaia: there was no mention of ESS and climate, the education section didn't even mention where you could study it, there was no real definition, no mention of NASA's role in formalizing the field, their committee, etc. - nada! I mean, you've got be kidding. Do you care about ESS at all or what? Calling what is standard what is ""neutral"" in this case would be like considering ""standard"" discussion of Jews in Germany in the 30s ""neutral"": the bias is oozing out of all your pores. What Plumbago's trying to say in his rationale translates into this -  because the standard practice is bullshit, standard practice is what should be left as ""neutral objective truth,"" and anyone trying to change this is biased. I am trying to be neutral, but describing Sally Hemings and Jefferson in a way that is ""neutral"" demands pissing off a lot of people, who of course are going to say that it is ""biased"" and ""out of context"", etc......
I've been fascinated with this Gaia/ESS relationship and done my research. You simply have not done the research, it would seem, to offer any alternative authoritative material to what I have included. Therefore Wiki is actually not in favor of what you are doing here at all. According to Wiki's rules, you can balance imbalances you perceive if you have appropriate but neglected material to add. You aren't supposed to be removing mine, and you obviously see that it is pertinent and authoritative.
Btw, Plumbago - a little question? All this talk about ""ESS researchers."" That sounds good, but like, isn't science done by scientists?  So, then, who are they? I mean, could you tell me this: who is the most famous ""Earth system scientist""? I mean, I could give you my own answer, but I want yours! I'd say, personally, OK, Ken Caldeira - after all, Ken is famous, has been on the faculty of one of the most elite ESS Depts. for a long time (and became a Dir. of Stanford's Carnegie Global Ecology center), he's cited in the major media a lot, coined the term ""ocean acidifcation,"" etc. Agreed, he's probably the most famous ""ESS scientist,"" right? So, where's the Gaia? The one time I had lunch with Ken, he told me he had just gotten together with ""Jim and Sandy"" the week before, Lovelock was telling him this and that about what he was up to, etc. They are close, Ken's grad thesis was on CLAW and putting it together with the Hamilton equation, etc. So, like the rest of the story and your perverse logic, Gaia and Lovelock is totally fundamental to Ken's whole career and even his personal life, but is not discussed. But, says Plumbago in his circular logic, since it isn't discussed, it isn't important, and it is ""biased"" to discuss it.

<user_id=Terradactyl>
OK, so who are 10 ""ESS scientists""?? By that I mean, people who would say to me, ""Hi, I am an ESS researcher."" I'll bet you can't name 5! And if you can't name 5, you should hide your head in shame like a VW exec......

<user_id=Plumbago>
– please read what people say and don't just write more and more stuff (less is more, etc.). My point has been from the start, and continues to be now, that an article on Earth system science should primarily reflect what it is that Earth system scientists, including prominent ones like Ken Caldeira, write in scientific journals. That way readers get an understanding of what these scientists think are important facts and concepts in understanding ESS. Agreeing with me so far? Good. As such, if a topic (like Gaia) gets short shrift in said scientific journals (and it does), that indicates that it is not a key central concept in ESS so should not dominate an article on ESS (which has been the nature of your edits since this kicked-off). Of course, the history of how ESS came to be what it is today is, naturally, also important, as are topics like Gaia which exist at the margins of active research, so they should appear in the article, but be contextualised as such. I don't think anyone disputes this - do they?

<user_id=Plumbago>
On the topic of ES scientists, whether Ken Caldeira is close personal friends with ""Jim and Sandy"" is secondary (for our purposes here at ESS; the article on Ken might be a good place for this) as to whether he talks about Gaia in his scientific output. Of which, I've checked on Web of Science and he '''does'''. He talked about Gaia in a paper (actually a book chapter; it's on my shelf) from 1991. Since then – judging, admittedly, only from paper titles, abstracts and keywords – he does not appear to think it merits further discussion. I can well imagine that he is interested and engaged with Gaia (I don't know him at all well), but it would not appear to be so much that he writes lots of papers on the topic (or any). As it happens, his 1991 paper concludes ambivalently on Gaian feedbacks, although it makes the general case that ""accidental"" feedbacks like DMS (whose star has faded in recent years) might be expected to persist (a point I'd heartily agree with). Anyhow, we should not be focusing on individual scientists here, but conveying to readers who want to know about ESS what it is that the scientists studying it actually write about. That is all. And if that happens to be Gaia, there should be no difficulty finding plenty of recent scientific papers to this effect.

<user_id=Plumbago>
Finally, and in passing, one objection that could reasonably be mounted to my characterisation of ESS is that Gaia is so accepted within it that it no longer needs discussion, or even mention by name, and is ''de facto'' ESS. However, this interpretation is belied by the fact that Gaia genuinely does rumble along in the scientific literature as a minority topic in ESS, occasionally getting attention as mechanisms are proposed and / or shot down. This, also, is limp support for it one day becoming accepted science (which, , might stem from space telescopes and climate models). But we're not there yet.

<user_id=Prokaryotes>
''Comment''' It also makes sense to look at the article on Gaia hypothesis, which mentions ESS two times, at least in 1 case based on a primary source. For this article we should add something along the lines of the Precedents section.

I have gotten the article protected for a couple of days. I don't think your argument, Prokaryotes, for expunging the well referenced material on the relationship between Gaia and ESS makes much sense: clearly, if ESS = Gaia, and the ESS name is the stand-in for Gaia, then your judging Gaia's importance to Ken Caldeira (or to the whole ESS field), by its number of mentions in ""paper titles, abstracts and keywords"" is not useful. In fact, Ken Caldeira was a lead author of the chapter I quoted from the Schellnhuber book, a quote which says that in the dispute about Gaia, it is really just about an approach to language, and that the underlying mechanisms are the same in both ESS and Gaia.

<user_id=Terradactyl>
The continuous removal of such obviously germane material to the topic of ESS is absurd and exposes a deep bias held by several current editors of this article.

<user_id=Isambard Kingdom>
Terradactyl: The protection log is here. Note that the several editors you are accusing of bias, I guess against Gaia, are, in fact, supporting a reasonable representation of Gaia in the article. What we need to see within the article is a balance of material.

<user_id=Terradactyl>
Hi, Isambard Kingdom - Well, there seems to be no balance at all among any of the current editors, except me, in dealing with the relationship between Gaia and Earth system science. That is because you apparently do not want it to be discussed at all except to say that Gaia played a role in the ""origins"" of ESS. I see it as essential to discuss the relationship between these things, with the full range of viewpoints on this interrelationship being discussed. The current version of mine in fact already covers a wide range of viewpoints  - from Sir Crispin Tickell, saying that they are basically synonymous, to those seeing them as distinct but still overlapping. Perhaps there are yet other ones I did not list that could be authoritatively cited, I don't know, but I have been asking all of you to include more. Multiple points of view are fine.
But the great irony here, with all this ""NPOV"" stuff, is that I do not even have a definite viewpoint on how best to characterize this interrelationship myself, and might say that, personally, it seems to me that in some contexts people are talking about the same things - as Ken Caldeira, etc, said, where the ""underlying mechanisms are the same"" - but in other cases they are not.
What seems most clear to me is that Toby Tyrrell was utterly wrong when he wrote that Gaia was ""irrelevent"" to ESS, and removed material that had been in this article since 2011, not long after the article was begun by Andrew Lockley. That was nonsense, and nothing could be more germane to this entry because, as I wrote to one of the administrators:
Now, if you have some very famous people saying 'X and Y are the same thing,' and other famous people saying, 'Well, X and Y are NOT the same thing, but interrelated,' is it not clear that it is germane to subject X (and to subject Y!) that this interrelationship be discussed in its article, with a full range of views of what that relationship may or may not be, as expressed through well-referenced sources?

<user_id=Terradactyl>
None of the arguments given thus far against having a section on the relationship between these things - given that such prominent people have expressed themselves so variously about it -  holds any water for me at all. The arguments of Prokaryotes and Plumbago about reflecting the ""daily lives"" of ""ESS researchers"" and so on seems like pure hocus-pocus. Note that, when I asked for it, no one could even draw up a list of famous ""ESS researchers."" Meanwhile, Jim Green, who I quoted in a sentence suggesting that ESS and Gaia are one and the same thing, was quoted just today in media outlets throughout the world, about water on Mars - Mars seems to hold more water than these arguments you are all pushing for expunging such well-researched material.

<user_id=Prokaryotes>
As i pointed out above, the science goes back much further (to the greek philosophers). It's not just gaia theory suddenly emerged in the 60s story, when we write on ESS. And today we can see the result of ESS in various forms and branches of the sciences.  Animations from NASA, or take NOAA's Science on a Sphere help to understand all these systems better, or take the IPCC report which assembles major works. Once you have studies which combine our planetary systems, you have earth system science.

<user_id=Terradactyl>
The obvious fact that both ESS and Gaia are preceded by the whole history of science (and I was the only one who added anything about this in the article, btw) is clearly meaningless for this dispute. You are NOT responding to what I just wrote, in saying this. The issue for you is to provide any justification at all -  if many prominent people, including one just quoted everywhere yesterday in worldwide media, speak in a way that fully equates these two things, ESS and Gaia - for barring from the article a reasoned and balanced discussion of the relationship between them. Expressing the full range of well-sourced opinions about how these things interrelate. It's an absolute no brainer.

<user_id=Isambard Kingdom>
Terradactyl, I have no doubt that famous people have said this or that thing, especially when they are engaged in publicity. But, again, the content that several editors support, here, for this article, already gives good representation to Gaia. ESS is bigger than Gaia; some subsets of ESS (such as those ideas related to Earth's interior or the space environment) are even not related to Gaia (see the lead). It is not useful to focus too much on one aspect of the very broad set of subjects that is ESS. I imagine that someone could make a case for ESS being ""invented"" by Humboldt, or, even, somebody else.

<user_id=Plumbago>
. If you did less writing and more reading you would realise that we (that is everyone bar you) agree that Gaia is a facet of ESS, that it should appear in the article, but that it should not be given the undue prominence that your additions persist in attributing to it. I believe that we would also agree that while having a role in the history of ESS, it is neither the origin of this subject (and not even the origin of the ""planet as living organism"" concept), nor a major current angle of research in the subject. You persist in using carefully chosen secondary sources to give undue weight to Gaia in ESS, and appear blithely unaware of (and unconcerned with) what passes for current scientific research in ESS. We're all happy for contributions here, but not with unjustified POV-pushing. An uninvolved reader visiting here should leave with an understanding of what ESS '''is''', and certainly not the idea that it's all rooted in Gaia - that would be a disservice.

<user_id=Terradactyl>
By the way, since Plumbago rudely writes that I ""appear blithely unaware of (and unconcerned with) what passes for current scientific research in ESS"" I repeat my earlier question: I want a list of 10 researchers who, if you asked them what they do, they would say, ""I do ESS research."" OK? Even 5 if you can. If you can't list the most prominent ESS researchers, this is all just pure phoniness.......

<user_id=Terradactyl>
Wait, uh, secondary sources? The primary texts used in university curricula are secondary sources? What are primary? That's a joke. Again, you are the POV pushers, not me, as I'm the one asking to cover the range of viewpoints, which you are desperately trying to impede. As I said, if prominent people see ESS/Gaia as identical, that clearly needs to be discussed at the entry, that's all. And that has nothing to do with giving it 'undue prominence' in the article, etc. - I had already been placing it at the end of the article. Again, I've also put more into this article than anyone else currently involved with it that is NOT related to Gaia. Isambard's talk about ""publicity"" is hardly worth responding to - and further, what is he talking about, ""some subsets of ESS (such as those ideas related to Earth's interior or the space environment) are even not related to Gaia""? Doesn't he know the subject matter? Paul Lowman was the very first geologist ever hired by NASA, and started comparative planetology, and ended his career working on Gaia, because the Mars Spirit & Rover started showing more and more about martian tectonics (i.e., the lack of Earth-style, that is), and this led back to those observations from Gaia about life/geological interactions even at this largest scale (Don Anderson had already proposed this kind of thing in the Gaia literature earlier on.....). It's hard to know what he is talking about, frankly......

<user_id=Terradactyl>
So what I am asking for here is very simple - clearly, there is no disagreement that Gaia needs to be mentioned. I am simply saying that the relationship between these two things needs to be discussed, with a range of viewpoints of what that relationship is. That's all.

<user_id=Isambard Kingdom>
Terradactyl, please have a look at the books cited in the lead, which make it clear that ESS is vastly broader than Gaia.

<user_id=Terradactyl>
I have no idea what you are talking about - 2 of the 3 books ""cited in the lead"" were only cited by me, initially, and the 3rd one isn't all that appropriate. I haven't complained about your loose use of these sources for your opening sentence, but clearly you don't know those books very well!! After all, I cited Jacobsen et al, saying that Gaia is designed to provide '''""a single scientific basis for integrating ''all components of the Earth system''""''' Clearly the authors do not agree with you. They also specifically take up the thorny issue of critics of Gaia theory, and criticize them, rightly, as using early formulations of the theory.

<user_id=Isambard Kingdom>
Hello? The lead, not the two books you favor. Look at the book on the Dynamic Earth. Look at the books on geography. Look at the books in nonlinear systems. They are all about ESS.

<user_id=Terradactyl>
Hello! I assumed by ""cited in the lead"" you referred to your opening sentence, but this is, in any case, not central to this dispute. What ''is'' central is this: Toby Tyrrell, who started all of this, wrote:
''""If Gaia is accepted as being right (which it isn't) then of course it would be fundamentally important for ESS and should be featured strongly here.""'''
I wouldn't even go so far as Tyrrell says, and most of Gaia should clearly be in the Gaia article, of course. But the big thing is this: many people, and even the academic textbooks on ESS used in degree programs, equate ESS and Gaia, as though they have the same underlying mechanisms but simply go by different names, just as the Schellnhuber et al book said, in my citation. While Tyrrell might like to use a formulation of Gaia where ""Gaia is wrong,"" and that's his choice, it should be obvious that, for all those other people, and all those other texts, etc, Gaia and ESS are, by definition and without any question, equally ""right"" or ""wrong"". Therefore, in that situation, Tyrrell suggests himself that Gaia ''should be featured strongly here''.

<user_id=Terradactyl>
But I don't go so far as Tyrrell in this. No in-depth discussion of Gaia is needed in this article. I only maintain that the '''relationship between ESS and Gaia''' NEEDS to be discussed (and, if it all possible, clarified) here. Thank You!

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Relevance to Gaia Theory**: The discussion revolves around the relevance and representation of Gaia theory in the Earth system science (ESS) article. There is a consensus that Gaia theory played a role in the development of ESS, but there is disagreement on the extent to which it should be featured in the article.

2. **Historical Context**: Some participants argue that Gaia theory should be acknowledged as a precursor or seminal influence on ESS, which is a valid point considering the historical development of the field.

3. **Current Scientific Consensus**: Others point out that Gaia theory does not represent a central theme in contemporary ESS research, suggesting that its prominence in the article should be limited. This is also a valid argument, as the representation in an encyclopedia should reflect current scientific understanding and consensus.

4. **Editorial Style**: There is a concern about the editorial style of the section in question, with suggestions to rewrite it in a more encyclopedic tone. This is a constructive critique aimed at improving the article's tone and style.

5. **Balance and Neutrality**: The discussion touches on the importance of balance and neutrality in the article, with some participants advocating for a more balanced representation of Gaia theory in relation to ESS. This is in line with Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View (NPOV) policy.

6. **Personal Bias and Conflict**: The dialogue reveals some personal bias and potential conflicts of interest, particularly with references to specific individuals who may have a vested interest in the separation or conflation of Gaia theory and ESS. This detracts from the objectivity of the discussion.

7. **Citation and Authority**: There is debate over the appropriateness of sources and whether certain texts are considered primary or secondary sources. The focus on authoritative sources is important for the credibility of the article.

8. **Understanding of Subject Matter**: Some participants question each other's understanding of ESS and related scientific fields, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine the credibility of opposing viewpoints rather than constructively engaging with the arguments presented.

Overall, the discussion includes several valid points regarding the historical significance of Gaia theory, the need for a balanced and neutral article, and the importance of reflecting current scientific consensus. However, the quality of the discussion is diminished by personal biases, conflicts of interest, and occasional ad hominem attacks. The focus on authoritative sources and the suggestion to improve the editorial style are positive aspects of the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Election 2014

<user_id=39.47.121.0>
Hello Friends ! in compliance with WP policies, i want a dispute resolution by some neutral WP admin. It all started when i first time read this article i found the following wording in the lead paras;
However, elections held in 2014 saw highest voters turnout in 25 years of history in Kashmir.European Union also welcomed elections, called it free and fair"" and congratulated India for its democratic system.The European Parliament also takes cognizance of the fact that a large number of Kashmiri voters turned out despite calls for the boycott of elections by certain separatist forces.
It looked out of place in the lead because this election dealt only 45% land area of kashmir state which is disputed between india, Pakistan and China. It also looked pro india because it ignored wining pro india chief minister and wining party head comments giving credit to Pakistan and separatists for allowing elections in the state. so i inserted it with indian source reference as follows.
However, elected Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed said, ""If God forbid the Hurriyat and the militants tried to disrupt the elections these would not have been as participative as they had been. They (Pakistan) also allowed these elections to take place."" Ruling Party president Mehbooba Mufti also defended Mufti's remarks.

<user_id=39.47.121.0>
Then what happened could be seen in detail on page history. Different tactics were used to remove these lines. My question to all my friends is ""Are we good faith neutral WP community or ""Are we like fraud lawyers who manipulate rules/law to achieve their goals. Might is right Or right is right ? Thanks.

<user_id=Kautilya3>
First of all, the lead is a quick summary of the article, highlighting the important ideas. There was already too much detail regarding the 2014 election, and you were adding a lot more, verbatim quotes from news reports. In general, you should add material to the article and then summarize it in the lead if it is sufficiently important. Other editors should agree with your judgement about the importance and, if they don't agree, you should discuss it on the talk page.

<user_id=Kautilya3>
I have now condensed the lead, while keeping your citation. Please feel free to add more discussion in the body. Please keep in mind however that this is an article about the Kashmir conflict, not an article on the 2014 election. There is a separate article for that. If you really want to do service to Kashmiris, consider creating similar articles on elections in Azad Kashmir -

<user_id=Faizan>
Yup, detail should be added to the separate article as it does not cover 70 years of history. But mention of Pakistan is required too.

<user_id=CosmicEmperor>
The news is not too important for this article, you can add this in the page
Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 2014  but not in this particular page., and kautilya you don't have to be too much over the top neutral.  

<user_id=Human3015>
, No need to add ""separatists does not tried to disrupt elections"", because there are numerous sources where separatist hurriyat leaders appealed to boycott elections. There is difference between ""separatists"" and ""militants"". Separatists are more like political activist which often pelts stones but does not categorise as militants and they have done their best to appeal people regarding boycott of recent elections and also they appealed shut down on various elections days. So word ""separatist"" should not be included in lead stating that they didn't disrupted election. But ""militants"" are those who use arms and do terror attack, though there was no such major terror incidence during elections still we can't say that its because of Pakistan was not willing to do any attack or they could not do it because of strong security during elections. Still mufti thanked Pakistan for that, he thanked militants. There are clear cut evidences that political separatists tried to disrupt the elections. •

<user_id=Kautilya3>
I am not being ""over the top neutral."" The IP made a good argument and convinced me that this is an important part of the ""Kashmir conflict"" as it exists today, and so it should be highlighted. Pakistanis want credit for not disrupting elections in the neighbouring country. Dubious honour though it is, they should get it. That is part of the conflict. -

<user_id=Human3015>
, its ok if Pakistan wants credit, but does Mufti is reliable source to give credit to Pakistan for smooth conduct of elections and writing it in lead? Give me one more independent source other than Mufti's statement giving credit to Pakistan. As one user said, Mufti's this statement can be written in Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 2014 not in lead of parent article of Kashmir conflict. Election commission of India, EU, UN officials,US officials congratulated India for smooth conduct of elections, who congratulated Pakistan? Mufti's statement came after his alliance with Hindu nationalist party BJP and he just wanted to show his voters that his ideology is not same like BJP and he is ""Pro-Pakistani"". So its just politically motivated statement. And we are writing it in lead of parent article.  •

<user_id=Kautilya3>
Yes, the views of Mufti, the elected Chief Minister, can be stated with ''inline attribution'' for the current affairs of which he had direct knowledge. (This is different from Narendra Modi claiming to have known what ""every Indian"" thought when he was 21 years old.) -

<user_id=CosmicEmperor>
Doesn't matter what Mufti says: You like the statement of that IP then add it to Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 2014. You very well know terrorists and separatists will always try their level best to disrupt elections; but they were not successful as BSF, CRPF and Indian Army did their best to stop Pakistani terrorists from entering Kashmir. Now in a similar situation, are you going to add these following reliable references in the wiki page of Taj Mahal?

Read the above links and add them to Taj Mahal if bogus claims by politicians(without any evidence) is so important for you.

<user_id=CosmicEmperor>
Mufti was lying and so are these people. 

<user_id=Kautilya3>
Sorry, I don't agree. Elections being free and fair is important, which is why the EU people mentioned it.  I think the due weightage in the last paragraph is quite fine. In a few months, we will get scholarly articles covering the election, when we can update the write-up based on them. Cheers,

<user_id=39.47.50.14>
Kautilya3 no need for you saying sorry because that is your opinion about what is important for you. But here we are discussing what should be in the lead. What if against european union certificate some one put Pakistan China and 56 countries OIC members declaring elections not a substitute of plebiscite giving kashmiries right of self determination. Therefore these EU certification for your kind satisfaction should be only in election 2014 separate article. Lead should be crisp as you earlier pointed out and should be stating turnover was good and winner telling the reason.

<user_id=39.47.50.14>
115.186.146.225 agreed 100% sir;  better try playing video games;  good thought friend but there are so many things which are important but we can not write a movie in the lead; it should be brisk; As Sir 115.186.146.225 stated every one agreed that turnover improved so no need to add extra qualifier certificates on fairness or greatness of Indian democratic system by a regional economic depression hit union. Certificates are only pasted when confidence level of propagator is weak or his position is dubious in world eyes so he wants to hide truth with lipstick touch ups or their are different contradictory claims. On a serious note turnover was good and winner telling the reason is the shortest lead entry. More reliable the sources less dubious WP insertions will be specially on sensitive issues. Agree on  para from sir (115.186.146.225)

<user_id=115.186.146.225>
Yes sobia naz (39.47.50.14). Additionally Current statement in the lead "" elections held in 2014 saw highest voter turnout in the last 25 years"" is strange and just like Deceptive marketing tactic we usually face around the world where advertiser claims best or highest in this or that (with only  favorable comparisons) which is a malpractice and is tried to be forcefully denied by regulatory authorities. Please see relevant wikipedia article here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_advertising. In election under discussion Turn out was lowest compare to election in  other indian states even less then azad kashmir and gilgit baltistan, interestingly no one highlighted that. After detailed thinking and edit history pattern I feel this page is being controlled by few indian editors so all our Talk page consensus efforts will be denied by hook or crook. see current lead statment about election 2014 as example. I think if we were denied neutral consensus we have to consult arbitration committee.

<user_id=Kautilya3>
115.186.146.225, importance is not attached to the sources and their views, but rather to the information that is stated. The fact that the elections were found to be free and fair is important.  The fact that the voter turnout was good is important. And, the fact that the separatists didn't cause disruption is important. It doesn't matter to me who said these things as long as they are reliable enough to be cited. -

<user_id=CosmicEmperor>
Question is, who are you? 

<user_id=115.186.146.225>
CosmicEmperor I do not agree with you statement against Kautilya3 for him showing neutrality.As far what i understand WP policies such instructions to others may disqualify anyone from editing WP because WP has high ethic standards and great reputation.

<user_id=115.186.146.225>
I agree with Faizan and Kautilya3 and feel that wining CM's statement who represent the state where elections were held is very important in this context. I also agree with Kautilya3 view that lead should short so I propose removal of European union and European parliament statements on following grounds
1. In the presence of European union note why to put extras like European parliament note or EU any other administrative unit/ department note.
2. Election had improved turnout as per one party (India) which was never denied by other party (Pakistan or Separatist) so there is no need for certificate service from European Union because no party dis agreed to this statement.
3. As far  European Union certificate of democracy to india is concerned that is not relevant in this artical.
4. European Union is neutral but it is not Pakistan or Pro pakistan separatist it is wining pro india CM by his own self is denying EU. so rival credit by default nullifies EU allegations.
So in order to shorten lead the whole para should be read like this.

<user_id=115.186.146.225>
 Elections held in 2014 saw highest voter turnout in the last 25 years, However, Credit to separatist leaders and Pakistan for the smooth conduct of the assembly election was given by elected Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed which was defended by Ruling Party leader Mehbooba mufti.

",1,"The discussion revolves around the content of a Wikipedia article related to the 2014 elections in Kashmir. The main points of contention are the inclusion of certain statements in the lead section of the article, the neutrality of the content, and the relevance of the European Union's comments on the elections.

Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The initial argument by the first user (39.47.121.0) is about the perceived bias in the article's lead section, which they believe is pro-India. They suggest adding statements by the elected Chief Minister and the ruling party president to balance the perspective. This argument is based on the principle of neutrality and providing a complete picture of the situation.

2. User Kautilya3 responds by emphasizing the importance of summarizing the article in the lead and suggests that the additional details be added to the body of the article instead. They also point out that the article is about the Kashmir conflict, not solely about the 2014 election. This argument is based on Wikipedia's guidelines for article structure and relevance.

3. User Faizan agrees that the detail should be added to the separate article on the 2014 election and mentions the need to include Pakistan's perspective. This argument supports the inclusion of multiple viewpoints for neutrality.

4. User CosmicEmperor argues that the news is not too important for the Kashmir conflict article and should be added to the page specifically about the 2014 election. They also caution against being ""over the top neutral."" This argument is about relevance and the appropriate placement of content.

5. User Human3015 differentiates between ""separatists"" and ""militants"" and argues against including statements that suggest separatists did not try to disrupt the elections. They base their argument on the evidence of separatist activities during the elections. This argument is about factual accuracy.

6. User Kautilya3 defends their position by stating that the elections being free and fair and the voter turnout are important aspects of the Kashmir conflict. They argue for the inclusion of these points based on their significance to the topic. This argument is about relevance and significance.

7. The discussion then shifts to the users (39.47.50.14 and 115.186.146.225) debating the inclusion of the European Union's statements and the highest voter turnout claim. They argue for a more concise lead and question the need for external validation of the elections. This argument is about conciseness and the necessity of certain details.

8. User NeilN reminds participants that the article is covered by discretionary sanctions and discourages edits hinting at offwiki collaboration. This is a procedural argument reminding users of Wikipedia's policies.

9. The discussion ends with accusations of sockpuppetry and offwiki collaboration, which are serious allegations within the Wikipedia community. These arguments are less about the content and more about the conduct of the users involved.

Overall, the discussion quality varies. Some users present well-reasoned arguments based on Wikipedia's guidelines, relevance, and neutrality, while others devolve into personal accusations and off-topic discussions. The arguments that focus on Wikipedia's policies and the importance of a neutral point of view are of higher quality than those that do not.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Page Move

<user_id=Factchecker25>
Based on prior talk posts, article has been renamed to reflect its subject matter. Eugene Plotkin is just one of six co-conspirators involved in the inside trading scheme and does not appear to be notable outside the scope of the scheme. Subsequent media coverage suggests other participants and David Pajcin in particular are notable within the scope of the inside trading scheme, but none are notable beyond the scope of the scheme.

<user_id=Smallbones>
I've moved the page back.  There was no consensus for a move.  There has been a history of rather crude games here, e.g. flocks of sockpuppets, deleting cited material, then filing for AfD.  We can discuss introducing new information, but hiding old well-cited info is not needed.  If I feel somebody is trying to censor me here, I will just inform the proper notice boards and administrators and there will be no censoring.  Doing this every 6 months is getting tedious.  ()

<user_id=TheRedPenOfDoom>
The recent name move was not an acceptable version. some options to discuss:
Pajčin and Plotkin insider trading conspiracy (based on alpha order of the primary participants)
Plotkin and Pajčin insider trading conspiracy (based on coverage each of the major participants has received)

<user_id=Factchecker25>
Remove 33% of new content, remove new references, and restore old references, many of which are not working properly? This is vandalism. Please do refer this to the proper notice boards and let us get a general discussion going, but this article is not ""owned"" by a particular editor. What is getting tedious is the clear campaign to keep the article limited in scope and lacking in NPOV. We can have a discussion on the talk page or on the notice boards, but that discussion needs to be completed with mutual respect before extensive edits and additions are simply removed. There has been a history of improper edits with this page, and the current attempt to keep new cited information out and challenge the expansion of scope is an extension of that impropriety. There have been particular individuals who have rolled back every edit as if this article is their own domain. That is not what Wikipedia is about.

<user_id=TheRedPenOfDoom>
it is ENTIRELY Appropriate to keep an article focused on the actual subject of the article.

<user_id=AndyTheGrump>
A simple question: what is the subject of this article? It is entitled 'Eugene Plotkin', but appears in fact to be almost entirely devoted to an insider trading scheme involving six different people. Why is the article about one of the individuals (who appears to be notable for nothing else), rather than the insider trading scheme?

<user_id=Factchecker25>
That is exactly the point. What is notable is the scheme, which is the reason for the move and the expansion of the NPOV. Article struck me as being biased to artificially focus on a particular individual even though the media coverage was clearly devoted to the scheme and the most recent coverage focused on other members of the group.

<user_id=Factchecker25>
Please stop undoing my revisions until a full discussion can take place on the BLP notice board.

<user_id=TheRedPenOfDoom>
(e/c) and do you have a suggested name for the article about the scheme? All of the coverage is about Plotkin's involvement (and not about others' involvement) and the media did not seem to give it a nifty name.

<user_id=Factchecker25>
That is simply not true. All of the coverage is not about Plotkin's involvement. There is significant coverage regarding Pajcin, Shpigelman, and Smith. The most recent coverage is about Pajcin. There is less coverage about Renteria and Schuster, but they had an admittedly lesser role in the scheme. The coverage does focus repeatedly on Business Week and Reebok, which is why I moved the page to ""Business Week and Reebok Inside Trading Ring"". It is a title that best reflects the coverage. No story refers to this as the ""Plotkin Ring"" or the ""Pajcin Ring"", which is why I think those titles would be missing the mark.

<user_id=AndyTheGrump>
Not having a 'nifty name' is no reason to skew an article, and the sources cited in the article clearly mention other people. I ask again, what is the topic?

<user_id=TheRedPenOfDoom>
we can decide what the subject is. it has been: ""Eugene Plotkin, a man involved in one of the largest insider trading schemes that the media has focused much coverage on.""

<user_id=AndyTheGrump>
Nope. If the insider dealing scheme is notable, we cover it. If it isn't, there is no justification for a biography of one of those involved. 'We' do not misrepresent articles about individuals involvement in crimes as biographies.

<user_id=Factchecker25>
I agree with AndyTheGump. It is particularly egregious in this case, when so much of the conspiracy involves Pajcin, Pajcin's aunt, Pajcin's high school friend, and Pajcin's girlfriend. Plotkin is not notable outside of the scheme. The question is whether the scheme is notable. If the consensus is that it is, then the name and the content of the article should reflect the topic.

<user_id=TheRedPenOfDoom>
the fact that we are talking about people involved in ""the largest insider trading scheme"" means that we are obviously talking about something that is notable and that will at the minimum result in Eugene Plotkin being a redirect to whatever the final subject is determined to be.

<user_id=AndyTheGrump>
Can I take it from that reply that you agree the article should be about the insider trading scheme rather than Plotkin?

<user_id=Factchecker25>
I believe that ""largest insider trading scheme"" is not an accurate description of this scheme at all. The scheme netted less than $7 million, which means it pales in comparison to schemes such as Galleon, Bernie Madoff, Michael Milken, SAC Capital, and others which are 10 to 20 times the amount. The only notable things about this scheme, aside from the media coverage, seem to be the usage of multiple sources (Business Week, Merrill Lynch, Grand Jury) - although the Galleon case involved even more sources - and a collection of a fairly motley group of conspirators.

<user_id=AndyTheGrump>
It is 'media coverage', or rather ""significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject"" that determines notability, as far as Wikipedia is concerned.

<user_id=TheRedPenOfDoom>
i agree that the community might come to the consensus that it is the scheme and not the individual that is notable, but i dont think that consensus has been reached yet. Plotkin has had specific features written about him and sources specifically singly identify him and no other individual names when talking about the event. while i have only seen one  that talks about any of the others without Plotkin.

<user_id=AndyTheGrump>
It simply makes no sense to suggest that a biography Plotkin can meet Wikipedia guidelines solely on the basis of being one of several participants in a non-notable insider trading scheme. If the scheme ''was'' notable, we must have an article on it before even contemplating having an article on Plotkin. If it ''wasn't'', this article must be deleted per WP:BLP1E policy. There really aren't any other policy-complying options.

<user_id=Smallbones>
The 26 refs look pretty solid, perhaps overwieghted to the New York Times, with a Washington Post, and Boston Globe, and several good international papers.  Many of the rest are the usual sprinkling of AP, local sources for local details (Harvard Crimson).  The 2 new ones can be linked to the source.  I checked back to the first ""finished version"" Jan 15, 2008, which still stands up as a marvelously written article (if I do say so myself) which reflects the sources at the time, which was when Plotkin was being sentenced and Pajcin being release for cooperating.  Back then I missed the NTY 2006 article which shows the story in a more rounded out way.  There likely were tons more stories that are now behind archive paywalls, but a google search on ""Eugene Plotkin"" gives 186,000 results, ""David Pajcin"" gives less than half that  at 69,000.  ""Stanislav Shpigelman"" only 2,720.  I conclude that the way the article is written now is consistent with the coverage in the media.  ()

<user_id=AndyTheGrump>
Yes - there are quite sufficient sources to justify an article on the insider trading scheme - can you explain why you are opposed to Wikipedia having one?

<user_id=Factchecker25>
As pointed out elsewhere, the number of Google hits on ""Eugene Plotkin"" only means that ""Eugene Plotkin"" is a far more common name than either ""David Pajcin"" or ""Stanislav Shpigelman"". A majority of those hits do not refer to THIS Eugene Plotkin, so they are irrelevant. All the trades were in Pajcin's account, Pajcin's aunt's account, Pajcin's girlfriend accounts, and various Croatians' accounts. The key trades came from Reebok, which was info provided by Shpigelman. Plotkin introduced Pajcin and Shpigelman, but then it was the Pajcin/Shpigelman nexus that drove this to the big payday. The coverage makes that clear. In any event, I think it has been well established here and I agree with AndyTheGrump that an article on the case should not masquerade as a BLP of Plotkin (or any of the other co-conspirators, for that matter).

<user_id=Smallbones>
You say ""The coverage makes that clear."" Actually, no.  It appears that there is a lot of interpretation going on here, or stuff that I haven't seen in the sources.  In any case, please provide refs.  ()

<user_id=Factchecker25>
The sources could not be more clear. The New York Times reported  that Reebok represented $6 million of the case, of which $2.5 million was in Pajcin's aunt's account, and that Pajcin was the leader. The New York Times also reported  that the $6 million was primarily distributed among the accounts of Pajcin's aunt (Anticevic), Pajcin's girlfriend (Vujovic), and various Croatians (Sormaz, Lopandic, Borac) living in Croatia and Germany. No surprise, as Pajcin is Croatian. The Boston Globe confirmed  that Pajcin is an ex-broker who was trading through his own accounts and a network of personal connections in Croatia, Germany and Austria. The Age confirmed  that Pajcin is a former stockbroker and that the FBI stated that Pajcin bought and sold the stocks. USA Today reported  that it was the Reebok trades in Pajcin's aunt's account that tipped off the investigation and that Vujovic was an exotic dancer who was Pajcin's girlfriend. With regard to Shpigelman, the Boston Globe reported  that Shpigelman leaked information about Reebok (largest part of the case) and that the government said he did it ""out of greed"". The New York Post reported  that Shpigelman was introduced to Pajcin in late 2004 and elsewhere it was reported that Pajcin was the one who paid Shpigelman. A number of these sources refer to it as the Reebok Insider Trading Case or similar.

<user_id=Smallbones>
Read the sources you provided: the 2005 and 2006 sources (before Plotkin was arrested) don't mention Plotkin, but the others (2007 sources) say that Plotkin was trading on the info and spreading the information to others.  ()

<user_id=Factchecker25>
I have read the sources in depth. I suggest you finally do the same. Plotkin was involved in the case. He introduced Shpigelman to Pajcin and was involved in recruiting the Business Week plant workers. However, Pajcin was clearly the central figure as the majority of the tippees were his Croatian family members or friends and the key accounts were traded in and controlled by him. The investigation started with him and his aunt and he was the only one to violate his sentence and flee the country. Within the case, the most valuable information was provided by Shpigelman. Plotkin received a lot of media attention in 2006 because he was arrested at that time and Pajcin was already cooperating, so the government's press releases (and the media, by extension) focused on Plotkin. However, if you look at the media coverage '''as a whole''', meaning from August 2005 until the present, the case and the underlying story line become far more clear. I realize that when you wrote the original Wikipedia article, you missed the 2005 coverage and did not go beyond the 2006 coverage. But that is certainly no reason to fight against the inclusion of that information and the revision of the article into one that deals with the topic in a more objective and even-handed manner.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The discussion begins with <user_id=Factchecker25> arguing for a page move based on the assertion that Eugene Plotkin is not the sole figure of notability in the insider trading scheme and that the article should reflect the broader scope of the scheme itself. This argument is based on the premise that notability should encompass all significant participants and the event as a whole, rather than focusing on one individual. This is a strong argument as it aligns with Wikipedia's guidelines on notability and the neutral point of view policy.

2. <user_id=Smallbones> counters by moving the page back, citing a lack of consensus and expressing concerns about potential censorship and improper editing practices. The argument here is more about the process and adherence to Wikipedia's procedural norms rather than the content of the article itself. This is a weaker argument as it does not address the substantive issue of whether the article's focus is appropriate.

3. <user_id=TheRedPenOfDoom> suggests discussing potential new names for the article that would reflect the involvement of multiple individuals in the scheme. This is a constructive approach, as it acknowledges the need for a more inclusive article title but does not immediately resolve the issue.

4. <user_id=AndyTheGrump> raises a critical point about the subject of the article, questioning why it is focused on Plotkin rather than the insider trading scheme itself. This is a strong argument as it goes to the heart of the issue and challenges the current framing of the article.

5. <user_id=Factchecker25> provides evidence from media coverage to support the argument that the scheme, rather than Plotkin alone, is the notable subject. This is a strong argument as it is supported by external sources and aligns with Wikipedia's notability guidelines.

6. <user_id=Smallbones> argues that the current article reflects media coverage, which they claim is more focused on Plotkin. However, this argument is challenged by <user_id=Factchecker25> who provides specific references to show that other individuals were also central to the scheme. This is a weaker argument from <user_id=Smallbones> as it seems to rely on an incomplete assessment of the available sources.

7. <user_id=AndyTheGrump> emphasizes that Wikipedia's notability is determined by significant coverage in reliable sources, which supports the argument for focusing on the scheme rather than an individual. This is a strong argument as it is based on Wikipedia's core content policies.

Overall, the arguments presented by <user_id=Factchecker25> and <user_id=AndyTheGrump> are stronger as they are more aligned with Wikipedia's guidelines on notability and neutral point of view. They also provide specific references to support their claims. The arguments from <user_id=Smallbones> and <user_id=TheRedPenOfDoom> are weaker as they either focus on procedural issues or do not fully engage with the evidence presented.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Suggestion to resolve

<user_id=North8000>
This can and has become a soapbox-via-coatrack of the more general GMO debate.  While, of course, the talking points of the movement and responses to those could be considered germane, that's a slippery slope to duplicating the whole GMO debate here.  My suggestion:  have only a small amount of talking points here, and equal amounts from the two sides. ''North8000''

<user_id=Viriditas>
I'm not seeing any potential for a coatrack nor a soapbox.  Your advice is a prescription for disaster and follows the failed media equivalency model that the scholarly articles rail endlessly about, and the last time I saw it implemented was in the Tea Party movement article. This protest has eight primary issues raised by protesters (popular support, labeling laws, limits on corporate lobbying, product safety claims, private and public revolving door, loophole legislation, patent claims, and sustainable agriculture).  What is Monsanto's ""side"" to this?

<user_id=Jytdog>
As far as I am concerned, the reason for the Fringe tag were the statements (which I think no longer exist) saying that currently marketed foods from GMOs are actually dangerous.  This is not a ""Monsanto point"" - it is the scientific consensus.  There are not just two ""sides"".   Others here have raised Fringe issues about other statements that they felt did not accord with reality (which again is different from ""Monsanto's side"") - I am not sure what the status of those objections are.  No Wikipedia article should be ""balanced"" in the sense of giving both ""sides"" an equal voice - that is crazy.  But every Wikipedia article should make sure that there is nothing stated that is Fringe (with respect to reality as described in reliable secondary sources - not with respect to the ""other side"") that is not tempered somehow.

<user_id=Viriditas>
I would invite people to read other featured articles on protest movements, articles like Stonewall riots, for example.  All relevant talking points are discussed in their appropriate context.  This is neither a soapbox nor a coatrack.

<user_id=Thargor Orlando>
That's because there are people here willing to do the work to keep that from happening, instead of treating it as a space for unquestioned bunk science.

<user_id=Thargor Orlando>
I've re-added the assertions of consensus from scientific bodies to bring us in line with policy on the matter.  As long as that's in place in some form, I have no further objections, for the record.  Yes, North is right that this is likely to become a soapbox without vigilant editing, but it appears enough of us are up for it.

<user_id=Viriditas>
Except, ''you'' are the one presenting bunk science.  According to an article about GMOs in the May 2 issue of ''Nature'' (497, 24–26) , ""Researchers, farmers, activists and GM seed companies all stridently promote their views, but the scientific data are often inconclusive or contradictory"".

<user_id=Thargor Orlando>
The overwhelming scientific consensus is that GM food is safe.  Period.

<user_id=Viriditas>
There is no such statement in that article, and there is no such consensus nor is it stated in those terms.

<user_id=Thargor Orlando>
Thus the need to add in the scientific consensus information.  You're wrong on this, and policy requires us to combat fringe science, period.

<user_id=Viriditas>
That's not a scientific consensus of any kind.  Even the latest issue of ''Nature'' disagrees with your old sources and notes the problems with GMOs and the contradictory science.

<user_id=North8000>
Not that this will resolve it, but the general statement-of-question that is being tossed around here (GMO's: Safe or not?) is so broad/ambiguous that the conversation can never possibly more forward.   For example:
''Which''' GMO's are you talking about?  Certain ones?  The ones in common use?  The ones that haven't been tested yet?  The ones that are not yet invented but will be soon? Every GMO that might be ever invented?
''Safe from what?'''  Harming human health?   Against having ''any'' negative effects? (such as from encouraging farmer behaviors that breed superweeds?)
''What is the threshold for considering it safe?''' Proven by science (proof of a negative)? ....there is no such thing.  Generally accepted as safe (e.g. by immense testing / evidence?  No known problems?
'North8000''

<user_id=Jytdog>
Viriditas - I just want to point out the full quote from Nature that you put into the article, brings up some of the  issues around GM crops around which there is scientific uncertainty.  But please note that in that extended quote, the relative risk to human health of GM food that is currently marketed, is ''not'' mentioned as something that there is any real scientific uncertainty over.

<user_id=Jytdog>
Follow up note.  I just removed that source and content based on it, as it was written on May 1 and does not reference the MaM nor can it be a response to the MaM.  This wikipedia article is about MaM and is not about the controversy over food from GMOs - right?

<user_id=Jytdog>
Thargor, in the flurry of commenting, please do not make overly broad statements like this - it does not help keep the issues clear. The consensus is ''not'' that ""GM food is safe"", and you know this.  I know it takes more time to type the whole thing but please do so. Thanks!

<user_id=Jytdog>
Hi North8000.  Great question.  I have been trying to keep this clear, too.  The scientific consensus is about food (in other words, stuff that humans eat and its risks to human health) and is not about crops (from which food is produced) and goes like this: ""currently marketed food from GMOs is as safe as (or as risky as, however you prefer) food from conventional counterpart organisms"".  It is not about any conceivable GMO used in any conceivable way, nor is it about the effects of GM crops from which food is made on environment nor is it about applied chemicals (not the effect of these chemicals on the environment nor on ag worker health) nor is it about industrial agriculture per se nor is it is about patents or other market aspects - it is about currently marketed food from GMOs and it is relative, not absolute.  I very much appreciate your effort to keep this clear.

<user_id=Thargor Orlando>
I don't agree, the science statements regarding what's being discussed ''are'' clear.

<user_id=Jytdog>
I appreciate that you are working to make sure the scientific consensus is well represented but statements this broad are not helpful - they actually match the ""straw man"" that people who are worried about GMOs set up.  The statement that ""GM food is safe"" is not true, stated this broadly, nor is it supportable.   The consensus is 1) about currently marketed food from GMOs and 2) importantly, is ''not absolute (which is absurd) but rather is relative to food from conventional organisms.''  It is absurd to say ""Water is safe"" and it is absurd to say ""Water is dangerous"".  Please, please do not throw gasoline on the fire by making overly broad statements. This is hard enough without this.  Thanks.

<user_id=Thargor Orlando>
If you give an inch, they'll take a mile.  I've already been accused of being a paid shill for even considering that there's a scientific consensus, and including these caveats where they don't belong in this article is, while noble and understandable, doing more harm than good.  When the argument is that GM foods are unsafe, the fringe position being put out there is wrong.  I have no problem with including the language as it is stated in the reliable sources for the article, but there's no need to mince words here.

<user_id=Groupuscule>
suggests that little scientific consensus exists on any issue pertaining to GMOs. This would include the claim that ""currently marketed"" genetically modified foods are ""as safe as food from conventional counterpart organisms"". Indeed, if any relevant scientific consensus ''does'' exist, it is that techniques of genetic engineering may well have unintended effects on the host organism—and can therefore ''not'' be presumed equivalent to a combination of ancestor plant + new genes. This claim amounts to saying 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts', a piece of conventional wisdom which Big Science™ has now borne out. Also: many genetically modified foods that are ""currently marketed"" in the US are banned as unsafe in other countries. As North8000 points out, ""safe"" is an very imprecise medical claim that Wikipedia almost never makes. That the claim of ""safety"" has been pushed so heavily for this relatively untested class of foods is astounding.

<user_id=Jytdog>
whoosh.  Not sure how to respond to this. I am accurately stating the scientific consensus, which is a nuanced statement (nuance is different than ""giving an inch"").  You will do as you will.   Good luck!

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **North8000** raises a valid point about the complexity of the GMO safety debate, noting that the question of safety can be very broad and context-dependent. They suggest that the conversation needs to be more specific in terms of which GMOs are being discussed, what kind of safety is being considered, and what the threshold for considering something safe is. This adds depth to the discussion by highlighting the need for precision in the debate.

2. **Viriditas** and **Thargor Orlando** engage in a back-and-forth about the existence of a scientific consensus on GMO safety. Viriditas argues that the science is inconclusive or contradictory, citing a recent article from *Nature*. Thargor Orlando asserts that there is an overwhelming scientific consensus that GM food is safe. This part of the discussion seems to lack the nuance that North8000 suggests is necessary, as it revolves around the binary safe/unsafe without considering the complexities involved.

3. **Jytdog** attempts to clarify the nature of the scientific consensus, emphasizing that it pertains to currently marketed food from GMOs and is relative to food from conventional organisms. Jytdog's contributions aim to bring precision and accuracy to the discussion, aligning with North8000's earlier point about the need for specificity.

4. **Groupuscule** challenges the notion of a scientific consensus, suggesting that there is a consensus that genetic engineering can have unintended effects and therefore cannot be presumed equivalent to conventional breeding. They also point out that some GMOs are banned in other countries, which complicates the claim of safety. This argument adds another layer to the discussion by introducing international regulatory perspectives and the concept of unintended effects.

Overall, the discussion quality is mixed. Some participants, like North8000 and Jytdog, strive for precision and acknowledge the complexity of the issue. Others, like Thargor Orlando, make broad statements that oversimplify the debate. Viriditas and Groupuscule bring in additional perspectives but also seem to be at odds with the notion of a clear scientific consensus. The discussion could benefit from more evidence-based arguments and a clearer focus on the nuances of GMO safety.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

Kenny Dalglish

<user_id=Shreerajtheauthor>
As far as I know in the club/international/individual awards not every single award has to be sourced. If you look at every football player or manager many are not sourced. But if you follow the internal wiki link for say English Football Hall of Fame or, PFA Players' Player of the Year you will find Kenny Dalglish at the years provided.
Of course If I can find additional external source links then I'll include them as it increases the credibility with more references, but you don't have to remove the current internal link I put there as they are valid, you can check them all.
Look at Alex Ferguson, Bill Shankly, even good rated articles like Lionel Messi. Many of the individual awards are not externally sourced.
Like I said I can add external source references where I find them but it's not defamatory or controversial like you said, and doesn't warrant removal.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

Everything unsourced on Biographies of Living People are subject to removal.  

<user_id=Shreerajtheauthor>
Not trying to be difficult Qed, but then you should remove every single award that every single football player or manager has as 90% of them are unsourced. Check them out. Like I said I would like to restore all of the individual achievements, and as I get time i'll add references that I find. But if you're expecting an external source for Dalglish winning the FWA Footballer of the Year in 1979 then it's VERY hard to find that.

<user_id=Qed237>
WP:OSE I can not be expected to edit all article, but I do know that many honours has been tagged and removed on other articles. When you add something you are responsible to source it.  

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Shreerajtheauthor argues that not every award listed on Wikipedia for football players or managers is sourced, and that internal Wikipedia links to pages like the English Football Hall of Fame or PFA Players' Player of the Year should be sufficient to verify the awards won by Kenny Dalglish. This user is suggesting that the practice of not sourcing every single award is common on Wikipedia and that the internal consistency of Wikipedia's content can serve as a form of verification.

2. User Shreerajtheauthor also mentions that they are willing to add external sources to increase credibility but believes that the existing internal links should not be removed as they are valid and can be verified by following the internal links.

3. User Qed237 counters by stating that everything unsourced on Biographies of Living People (BLP) is subject to removal. This is a reference to Wikipedia's strict policy on BLP, which requires a high standard of sourcing to ensure that information about living individuals is verifiable and not potentially defamatory.

4. User Shreerajtheauthor then challenges Qed237 by suggesting that if this standard is to be applied, it should be applied universally to all football players and managers on Wikipedia, implying that there is a lack of consistency in the enforcement of sourcing requirements.

5. User Qed237 responds with WP:OSE (Other Stuff Exists), a Wikipedia guideline that essentially states that just because other articles have unsourced information, it does not justify including unsourced content in the article in question. Qed237 also reiterates that the responsibility to source content falls on the person who adds it.

Evaluation of Arguments:

- User Shreerajtheauthor's argument is based on the observation of common practices on Wikipedia and the use of internal consistency as a form of verification. However, this argument does not align with Wikipedia's strict sourcing policies for BLPs, which require clear and reliable external sources.
  
- User Qed237's argument is grounded in Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, which prioritize the verifiability and reliability of information, especially for living individuals. Qed237's stance is more in line with Wikipedia's standards for sourcing and the responsibility of contributors to provide sources for the content they add.

Overall, while User Shreerajtheauthor raises a point about the practical difficulty of finding sources for certain historical awards, the argument does not adequately address the importance of adhering to Wikipedia's BLP sourcing policies. User Qed237's argument is more consistent with Wikipedia's guidelines and emphasizes the need for verifiability and the prevention of potential defamation.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6

The score reflects that while there is an understanding of Wikipedia's practices and some valid points are raised by User Shreerajtheauthor, the discussion is ultimately guided by Wikipedia's policies as highlighted by User Qed237. The score is above average because both parties are engaged in a substantive discussion about Wikipedia's content standards, but it is not higher due to the initial resistance to Wikipedia's strict BLP sourcing requirements.",6.0

Reviews of The Hindus

<user_id=FreeKnowledgeCreator>
Two long quotations from reviews of Doniger's ''The Hindus'' have been added, one from Shrimali, and the other from Locher. I appreciate the need to include critical reviews of Doniger's work, but those quotations are much, much too long, and need to be cut back. We need only the basic points made by the reviewers, not lengthy quotations whether disparaging or not. See WP:UNDUE.

<user_id=Fowler&fowler>
I'm aware of WP:UNDUE.  But, Wikipedia places academic peer-reviewed sources above all others.  There are two other reviews available in scholarly sources, but by lesser-known scholars, and they are not particularly complimentary either.  The quotes are certainly not UNDUE as reflection of scholarly response in the scholarly literature.
Moreover, as it stands, the article has plenty links to best book lists, everyday reviews and everyday reviewers.  An open-letter by Arundhati Roy which describes Penguin (founded in the mid-1930s to supply a market for cheap paperbacks in depression-era England) as ""one of the oldest, grandest publishing houses in the world. You existed long before ... mosquito repellent or scented soap"" has been cited twice (This, when OUP and Cambridge have been around since the 16th century, and commercial perfumed soaps and mosquito repellents (not to mention birch bark) have been sold at least since the 18th century) Why then does Ms. Roy's ""we're all in this"" suddenly become reliable and notable?  Doniger herself, no expert on Indian law, describes the ""real culprit"" to be a section of Indian law (section 295A of the Indian Penal Code), when the case never went to trial. Why is that notable and reliable?

PS The point needs to be made that ''The Hindus'' is a shabby book, written by an author who has bitten off more than she can chew.  A book which relies on popular trade histories such as Keay's ''India: A History'', which even Wikipedia's India page does not allow to be used in its references, cannot be a rigorous scholarly effort.  The book, moreover, is littered with errors of historicity (such as the ""Bengal famine of 1850–56,"" for the Bengal famine of 1770, which are more than misprints, evidence of half-digested understanding; myriad others, abound on other pages.  This has nothing to do with the insidious design of the Hindu nationalists, but needs to be pointed out as part of a scholarly assessment. Doniger has written great books in the past.  This, sadly, is not one of them.

<user_id=Goethean>
The long quotations are flagrantly inappropriate, as F&F; no doubt understands. This is a biographical article on Wendy Doniger. It is supposed to be about her entire life and career, not on two reviews of her latest book. I have removed the long quotations. —

<user_id=Fowler&fowler>
Why then do you have a separate section on ''The Hindus''?

<user_id=Goethean>
Because it was banned in India, which is a highly notable event in Doniger's biography. The fact that a book designed for a popular audience has received ""scant attention"" in academic journals is not only unsourced and unsourcable, but a complete non sequitur. —

I've removed facts sourced to Roy per your comment. One would think that Doniger's statement in response to the bruhaha is notable to her own biography, her knowledge of Indian law notwithstanding. —

OK.  I hadn't really looked at the article's history, which I just did.  Didn't realize that ''The Hindus'' section was just added.  I've read most of WD's books going back to Siva the Erotic Ascetic, and I think she is a splendid scholar; the other books need some coverage as well, as do the Hindu nationalist motivations, reactions, and responses, none of which are particularly scholarly, but have considerable scholarship devoted to them.  Sadly, I'm flat out of time, and I've already spent more time that I had for this page.

<user_id=Goethean>
This edit makes no sense and should be reverted. References to reviews of a popular book in all the book reviews should be presented before reviews in two academic journals. Also, the long pointless descriptions of the professors titles and universities is unhelpful (this coming from an editor who, hilariously, just removed the name of Doniger's professorship ''from her own biography''!) —

<user_id=Shii>
I agree that the book's exceeding popularity deserves a mention before its academic reviews, and that it is pointless to write out the names of reviewers. But  I respectfully disagree that popular reviews are more important. A principal factor in the book's popularity is Doniger's claim to academic expertise in India.

<user_id=Fowler&fowler>
Reply to both Shii and Goethean: Academic peer-reviewed sources take precedence over popular reviews.  I am happy to summarize the content of the academic reviews without naming reviewers.  In addition, there are two other academic reviews that I could find; I'm happy to add them, as well.  They are not gushing either.  Professorships, especially painfully long ones that the University of Chicago is wont to grandiosely invent (e.g. Charles R. Walgreen (of drugstore fame) Distinguished Service Professor in the Booth School of Business, Professor in the Department of Economics, Professor in the Department of Sociology, and the College) are unencyclopedic.  Can you find any such cockamamie formulations in Britannica? Why should Doniger have such a turgid fruit salad in her lead when much better-known Indologists such as Max Müller (Taylorian professor of MEL, later of Professor of Comparative Philology at Oxford) and Robert Charles Zaehner, Doniger's own Oxford adviser (and holder of the Spaulding Professorship of Eastern Religion and Ethics) have nothing, simply descriptions of what they did?  I'm strapped for time, saddled with family emergencies, as my user pages proclaims. I have already wasted enough time.

<user_id=Fowler&fowler>
PS I dispute that this book was popular either in India or the US.  For starters, it cost Rs 999 (=$22 in 2009 money) in India beyond the range of most middle-class Indians.  It was number one in the Hindustan Times nonfiction best seller list during the week of October 15, 2009.  We have no idea how these lists are computed and what the sales were.  English language books typically sell poorly (in absolute numbers in India). VS Naipaul said in an interview that his Indian market was insignificant.  A few thousand copies sold push you to the top of these lists.  Penguin New York, for example, are now rushing only some 3,000 books to India in light of this controversy.  If they had anticipated a bigger market, they would have shipped more.  We need some numbers for its sale in the US and Britain to gauge popularity.

<user_id=FreeKnowledgeCreator>
I see you have shifted the quotations to a footnote. I'm afraid that seems completely pointless. I don't think the quotations serve a useful purpose, and would be in favor of removing them entirely.

<user_id=Fowler&fowler>
I don't see how you can object to them.  They amplify the scholarly objections.  Besides, the journals are subscription only; the quotations provide proof that the summary is accurate.  One review is 15 pages long, more detailed than any published review of the book anywhere, written by one of the foremost historians of ancient India; the other three pages long by one of the foremost Indologists.  Quotes are routinely included in scholarly citations.  There is a good reason that both Sfn and Citation templates have ""arguments"" for quotations.  There is also a good reason, why the {{Request quotation}} template exits on Wikipedia. You apparently simply want to gloss over Doniger's errors.  She was a good scholar, but she sadly overreached, and is looking silly, especially in the early-modern and modern sections of the book.  It is painfully obvious that she's not a historian, excellent translator and expositor of Sanskrit texts though she might be.  That's not my fault, nor the Hindu nationalists' (though they have plenty other issues).  It's hers alone.  She should have stuck to what she knows best.

<user_id=Fowler&fowler>
PPS According to a BBC story, the top two English language nonfiction bestsellers in India for 2011 had sales of 47,000 each (averaged).  Moreover, the market had grown 45% in the previous six months.  Based on this, if we take the yearly rate increase of the previous two years to be conservatively 60% per year, the top nonfiction bestseller in 2009 would have had sales in the range of 18,000 for the year 2009, and in all likelihood fewer.  Doniger's book was No 1 for that week.  A couple of weeks later it had slipped to number 4 or 5.  In other words, we are talking about relatively minor sales.  Western English language non-fiction bestsellers sell more than that in one day.

<user_id=FreeKnowledgeCreator>
The quotations prove nothing at all if people cannot access the original scholarly journals and verify their accuracy. They thus don't serve any real purpose. (Since you raise the question of my motives, I should add that I haven't read Doniger's book, of course have no opinion about it, and couldn't care less about protecting it or its author from criticism).

<user_id=Fowler&fowler>
Many editors (college and graduate students and academics) do have access to these journals through their institution's subscription.  Wikipedia relies on them to keep editors who create content honest.  The larger number of editors who don't have access rely both on the quotations for more details and on the former group for vetting those details.  Quotes are not unusual for articles on controversial topics (see for example Death of Subhas Chandra Bose.  Besides, the internet gives easy access, in this instance to the views of both the Hindu nationalist hatchet men (Rajiv Malhotro) and the liberal shallow water waders, such as Pankaj Mishra, William Dalrymple, and Arundhati Roy.  The sober academic reviews written by the experts blush unseen in the desert air.  I apologize for insinuating that you were attempting to snuff criticism of the book.  I have scratched the comment above. Again, please accept my apologies.

I'm sure you've noticed but if not, The Hindus: An Alternative History has been created.  ''''

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The discussion begins with a concern about the length of quotations from reviews of Doniger's ""The Hindus"" in the article. The user FreeKnowledgeCreator suggests that the quotations are too long and violate the Wikipedia policy WP:UNDUE, which states that undue weight should not be given to particular views.

2. Fowler&fowler responds by emphasizing the importance of academic peer-reviewed sources over other types of reviews and defends the inclusion of the lengthy quotations as reflective of scholarly response.

3. Goethean argues that the long quotations are inappropriate for a biographical article and removes them, focusing on the notability of the book's ban in India as a significant event in Doniger's biography.

4. Fowler&fowler and Goethean discuss the relevance of academic reviews versus popular reviews, with Fowler&fowler asserting the precedence of academic sources and Goethean emphasizing the overall balance of the article.

5. Shii enters the discussion, agreeing with the need to mention the book's popularity but also supporting the importance of academic reviews due to Doniger's claim to academic expertise.

6. Fowler&fowler provides additional context about the book's sales and popularity, questioning the significance of its bestseller status and arguing for a more nuanced view of its impact.

7. FreeKnowledgeCreator questions the utility of the quotations if the original sources are not accessible to all readers, suggesting that they do not serve a real purpose.

8. Fowler&fowler defends the use of quotations for those who do have access and for providing more detail on controversial topics, and apologizes for an earlier insinuation about FreeKnowledgeCreator's motives.

9. NeilN informs the group that a separate article for ""The Hindus: An Alternative History"" has been created, which could potentially change the context of the discussion.

Reverts

<user_id=Mattnad>
There have been some reverts to eliminate some of the nuance of the recent studies:

<user_id=Mattnad>
Well, here's the quote from the Washington Post that supports that, ""Researchers acknowledged the possibility of an overstated victimization rate because there was evidence that hundreds of thousands of students who ignored the electronic questionnaire were less likely to have suffered an assault.""  I'd be interested in how what was written is not supported by the source.  If it is not, then how?  We can edit accordingly rather than eliminate it.

<user_id=Mattnad>
This change was made because an editor didn't like the source, arguing it's editorial.  So here's the same information from the study itself.  On page 110, which itemized why someone did not report an incident, 58.6% indicated, ""I did not think it was serious enough to report"".  It's not an editorial statement.  It's right from the study.  I can provide a citation for that and will if that will satisfy, but Wikipedia does not have a prohibition on article or editorials just because an editor doesn't like the source.  What we require for is verifiability.  Unless someone can say it's not verifiable, then it's POV to exclude.
removes a concurrent 2015 survey.  It was presented as a different survey, and if the editor had looked at the title of the section, it falls under that section nicely (2015 Campus Surveys.  If he or she wants to qualify it with more information, that's fine, but anyone who does survey work knows that low sample rates can lead to reporting bias and that highlights the differences.  Removing it because it's different is not supportable given the topic.

<user_id=Nblund>
Regarding point 1: I missed this. I self-reverted, but reworded a little to attribute the statement to researchers, and to avoid too closely paraphrasing the source.

<user_id=Nblund>
Regarding 2: I agree that this is giving undue weight: this is a major academic study, the criticism being cited applies to every sexual assault survey discussed in this section. The consensus among researchers is that this really isn't a problem with the surveys: people often downplay even very serious sexual victimization because of guilt, fear, or embarrassment. The implication that this invalidates the surveys is just not supported by existing evidence.

<user_id=Nblund>
Regarding 3: Perhaps I'm misreading this, but according to the link they cite in the article the 5% figure for Kentucky is the number of students, both male and female, who were raped in the current school year (see: link). This is actually higher than the comparable finding in the AAU surveys (3.2% vs 5%) and the CSA.

<user_id=Mattnad>
Thank you for self reverting the first.  On the second and third items, your reasoning is different from the other editor's (which suggests that his or her reasoning was reflexive), but let me address each:

<user_id=Mattnad>
On the Majority of respondents not thinking their assault was worth reporting, this is not a criticism at all. It's a detail from the survey that's not presented anywhere else in the article.  We are often told that the majority of assaults go unreported (true), and include that as some indictment of the state of current affairs, but we never the reason, or at least not in a quantified way.  This is actually good news in a sense, since we now have a quantified level that most sexual assaults in these surveys did rise to a level of seriousness for the respondents to report.  It's not WP:Undue per the guidelines:  It's neither a fringe source nor presented as an opinion: it's coming from the same survey that you have no issue including high level numbers.  That it has not been detailed in some news reports (although it's covered in one newspaper and several other sites) is no more of a fringe idea than the many stats you have added in the lede that were never reported by secondary news sources and come from more obscure sources than this survey (and are not even explained at all in terms of what they are measuring and where).

<user_id=Mattnad>
On the third revert, this article is about Campus sexual assault - not Campus sexual assault of women only.  If you want to add a breakdown of the Kentucky University stats, you can, but as presented made no suggestion that it wasn't the overall numbers.  Unlike many surveys in these areas, Kentucky actually got a large sample which is also very notable and makes the results more reliable in comparison to the AAU.  If you want to elaborate more on the details, fine, but eliminating a documented and topical survey from the article seems excessive.

<user_id=Nblund>
A majority (58%) of women who gave a ""not serious enough to report"" response said that they were victims of forcible rapes. We're talking about violent sex crimes here, they're clearly serious from a criminal justice standpoint. Numerous academic articles have looked at the way victims of crimes minimize including serious violent crimes (examples: here and here). This is also true for victims of incest, domestic violence, and child victims of sexual assault. If we want to include some discussion of the subjective experiences of sexual assault by victims, we should do it using good quality material and we should make it clear that this ""not serious"" response isn't something unique to this particular study. It is UNDUE to have coverage of an important topic in the study of rape and sexual assault be limited to a single editorial from a right-leaning paper.

<user_id=Nblund>
Regarding the Kentucky survey: Kentucky doesn't provide that breakdown. I'm not saying it should be excluded because it measures sexual assaults against men, I'm saying that it is misleading to present it as though it contradicts the findings of the AAU surveys. If we use an apples-to-apples comparison and look at the combined rate since the start of the school year for men and women experiencing rape, that is actually higher than the comparable rate reported in the AAU surveys, not lower (see table 3-11 on page 67 of the full report)

<user_id=Mattnad>
On your first point, I'm not depending on an editorial (it's actually a news report).  I'm looking at the study, as have you.  On adding qualifiers, you'd be veering into original research citing sources that do not mention this study or come from it (and the study did not say it was forceable rape, you did).  BTW, only 0.3% of college women and 0.2% of men reported ''coercive'' penetration since enter college according to table 3-14/15 on pages 73-74 which I think I'll add to the section.  That written, let's see what you have in mind as a qualifier including the source. I'll add that when you look at other categories of assault like touching (nearly twice the reported rate vs. penetration), the ""not serious enough"" reason goes up to 75%.  I bring that up because the 20% overall stat for women is presented in the article includes touching.  On your second point, the section is not just the AAU study but recent campus surveys.  So Kentucky presents another study at a college (with a better sample size at that).  If you want to make it easier to compare, then you can add the combined Male/Female assault rates to the AAU study section (note that Table 3-11 you bring up is only sexual penetration from the AAU study, not Kentucky, and does not include touching).

<user_id=Nblund>
The study does call it rape (see page VIII of the introduction) so does common sense. This is a stat that is included in the AAU report, but the conclusion you're drawing isn't something that comes from that report, it comes from an opinion piece. Its also not a conclusion supported by the existing consensus among experts in this field.

<user_id=Nblund>
To be clear, I'm not suggesting this argument just needs caveats. This isn't a critique unique to this study, so it doesn't make sense to present it as though it is. Its a fairly well-researched phenomenon, the same question is presented in the NCWSV and the CSA, and the results are similar in both. This exact criticism has been cited previously by critics of this sort of sexual assault study, dating all the way back to Christina Hoff Sommers in the 70's. Researchers generally view it as a product of minimization. I'm open to including this discussion in the entry, but it shouldn't ignore the findings of experts in the field or obscure the reality of the debate.

<user_id=Nblund>
The 5% stat from the Kentucky study also doesn't appear to include non-consensual touching: page 4 of the executive summary  states that "" UK Students (n=1,053; 4.9%) reported unwanted sexual experiences (vaginal, oral, or anal sex)...""  it appears they're discussing penetration exclusively. I think the documentation here is kind of lacking, but, if anything, it appears to be higher than the comparable AAU estimate.

<user_id=Mattnad>
I'm not drawing any conclusions.  I'm just for providing a detail from the report that puts the numbers in better context ''per the study and not some unrelated original research coatrack''.  So, based on your reading, does the AAU study not report that most respondents that were categorized as victims who did not report answered because they didn't think it was serious enough? I'm not understanding your objection to the source.  Do you think that the AAU is lying? And yes, Kentucky used the same definitions of sexual assault as the DOJ and Harvard School of Public Health.  If you want to add that (per the source) we can.

<user_id=Nblund>
The statement that was removed was sourced to the Washington Examiner. Its almost a verbatim quote from that source, and the wording appears to imply that the researchers characterized things as sexual assault when they weren't. The consensus among researchers is that these are serious crimes that respondents downplay out of guilt or shame. If you want to include a statement about the reasons people choose not to report sexual assault to the police, that sounds fine, but it should be done in a way that accurately characterizes the views of experts in the field.

<user_id=Nblund>
I cited previous research on this topic by BS Fisher, who is one of the most recognized experts in this field. I don't think you're going to get very far arguing that this study is coattrack while simultaneously claiming a story from a relatively obscure conservative paper warrants inclusion.

<user_id=Nblund>
What, exactly, would you want to say with the inclusion of the info from Kentucky? The previous version seemed to imply that the findings contradicted the findings of the AAU study, but, if anything, the resulting estimate is higher, not lower. I'm not opposed to including it as long as it is accurately characterized  but it kind of seems pointless.

<user_id=DPRoberts534>
New article in Huffington Post Blog noting the discrepancy between the claims made by the AAU researchers and the mainstream reporting on the study.

<user_id=Mattnad>
I'm talking about using the survey as the citation, not the Examiner. I think you don't like is that the majority of women didn't think their experience was that serious and you want to keep that out of the article, or try to suggest that all of them might in retrospect realize they were horribly assaulted via qualification. That's OR when attached to this particular survey since Fisher didn't review this particular work. For an example of how your approach could be used in a way you'd dislike, what if we followed every marcro assault rate report with research on false reporting, etc.  There's research out there that tracks that, and if someone is biased enough as an editor, they could insist on it.  But it would be POV, OR, and rightfully removed.  If you want to include Fisher, we can bring in a comment about Fisher's findings where appropriate separately.

<user_id=Mattnad>
About Kentucky, I want to include their findings since they are topical.  The original sentence is a good start, and we can qualify it based on differences in approach. And for the record, your concerns about differences in methodology and scope did not prevent you from adding this line, ""Other research creates estimates ranging anywhere from 10%[1] to as many as 29%[7] of women having been victims of rape or attempted rape since starting college"" to the prevalence section.  Neither of those stats are qualified in the least.  We have no idea what they are measuring (including definitions), when, where, or how.  It would seem you have differing standards when it comes to detail in the article.  It's a source of frustration for me here.

<user_id=Nblund>
If you're not attributing it to another source, then its a novel synthesis: you're emphasizing an aspect of the study that is not emphasized by the authors themselves, in order to imply something that the authors would probably dispute.

<user_id=Nblund>
I think I've been fairly clear that I'm not saying that we should keep this out of the article, I'm saying we should present as a common complaint among critics of these kinds of surveys that dates all the way back to the work by Koss ( example), Cathy Young made the same criticism of the NCWSV a year ago (here).
These sorts of responses are frequently cited by critics of these studies to suggest that the incidents being measure are relatively benign, but experts doubt that is the case. From the previously cited article by Fisher:

<user_id=Nblund>
Your example isn't really analogous: there really isn't research that tracks false reporting of rape in surveys, and researchers don't generally believe that these surveys contain a large number of false reports. If those materials existed, I would support presenting these criticisms in a separate section.

<user_id=Nblund>
The original statement about the Kentucky surveys made an invalid comparison, I don't really think its a good starting point. It seems extraneous, but, if you want to include it, it should be compared to the analogous finding in the AAU report.

<user_id=Mattnad>
Ah, now I see the source of your thoughts - so Fisher is presenting a feminist interpretation of these common findings and as I read it, it's an opinion rather than a simple NPOV presentation.  You've made a big deal about article from the Washington Examiner, and are using that to disqualify what the study found.  The same article provided the overall rates - shall we say those are opinions too and use that to disqualify the study findings?  The study didn't emphasize the rates of coercive penetration either.  Are those disqualified from the article?  Shall we only include what news reports find?  Then that would eliminate most of the article that refers to study and book details.   You see where this can go.

<user_id=Nblund>
Fisher is pointing to reasons to doubt the claim that these were not serious events and calling for more study. Its a view from one of the most respected experts in the field, which happens to be shared by most other experts in the field, and one which has a substantial amount of empirical support. The overall rates appear to be sourced to an article in the Washington Post, not the Washington Examiner. Its not a problem to point out something in a book, but its pretty clear from your previous statements that you want to highlight this fact because you believe it indicates that these are not particularly serious sexual assaults. That's not a view that appears to be supported by the authors of the study, nor is it one generally supported by most experts in the field.

<user_id=Mattnad>
Fisher seems to be highlighting a fringe theory that's you'd like to attached to study. The passage you cite says ""may"" over every counter explanation.  It's very tenuous vs. the simple, straight forward results from the study. Perhaps it's not fringe to you, but it's pretty out there for an encyclopedia.  So on three points you shouldn't add this qualifier a) it's OR on your part - the Fisher passage is not related to this study by any reliable source, b) it's WP:Fringe.  Perhaps it pains you that the study captured this, but your argument that the researchers didn't highlight this is nonsense.  They asked the question and published the results.

<user_id=Nblund>
Her work is already cited in the entry: she's the lead author of the National College Women Sexual Violence Study. She's written dozens of articles and has been cited thousands of times on the topic. How are you defining ""fringe"" exactly? What do you mean by ""out there""? The notion that this is original research is absurd: previous research has asked ''literally this exact same question'' and received roughly the same result, and these findings have been addressed repeatedly in multiple published reports. Its not original synthesis to make a patently obvious connection.

<user_id=Nblund>
You've made it clear that you want to report this finding in order to imply something that isn't supported by a reliable source. As I've said multiple times in the past: I'm not suggesting that we ignore or not report this, I'm saying we should discuss it in detail  acknowledging that its been a source of criticism in the past. Aside from being based on a dubious interpretation of the rules, it seems to fundamentally go against the spirit of Wikipedia to mislead people about the scholarly consensus.

<user_id=Mattnad>
The author may be mentioned often, but the paragraph as written represents other people's views and includes opinions of others (with no attribution).  Furthermore, the statement as written is speculative, with every possible reason as ""may"".
As for what you think I'm trying to say, I'm doing my best to quote from the survey.  So, does that stat (page 110), sourced from the survey, imply something that's not from the survey?  Is the study not a reliable source?  What exactly, without your own reinterpretation, does that published statistic say? I'd really like you to read it, and tell me exactly what it says.  To me, it provides detail to the higher 1 in 5 stat from the perspective of the victims.  So here's how I interpret it: according to the survey results, when asked the majority of respondents indicated they didn't think their experience was serious enough to report.  Is that incorrect based on the survey?  How?

<user_id=Mattnad>
I will add, quoting a recent articles from: the Washington Post, ""the vast majorities of poll respondents who said they had not reported to campus authorities the events that the AAU classified as sexual assaults — 'the dominant reason was it was not considered serious enough,', Chicago Tribune, ""More than half of those who didn't report a rape said they didn't think it was serious enough to report."", NJ.com ""The most common reason cited by students for not reporting an incident was that they didn't consider it serious enough"", CNN ""More than 50 percent of the women who reported some of the most serious incidents, including forced penetration, didn’t report it because they didn’t think it was “serious enough,” according to the survey."", The Daily Toreodor ""More than 50 percent of the victims of even the most serious incidents, such as forced penetration, said they did not report the event because they do not consider it “serious enough,” according to the survey."", Michigan Daily, ""Of University students who experienced nonconsensual penetration involving physical force, 76.8 percent of them did not report the crime."", Campus Safety Magazine, ""When students were asked why they did not report incidents of sexual assault and sexual misconduct, the most common reason was that it was not considered serious enough."", My Fox 8 ""More than 50 percent of the women who reported some of the most serious incidents, including forced penetration, didn’t report it because they didn’t think it was “serious enough,” ""  These are all secondary news sources that found that it notable to comment on students not reporting.  None of them qualified that stat the way you want to.

<user_id=Nblund>
You previously quoted from an editorial criticizing the report. Some of the quotes you're providing now are substantially more nuanced. The quote from the CNN article, makes it pretty clear that these ""not serious enough"" responses happen even with fairly serious incidents  including forcible rapes  and includes a quote from an leader of an anti-rape group that notes that this may be the product of a ""victim blaming mentality"".
I don't think the notion that this is a fringe view really even warrants much discussion. Fisher is laying out the arguments, its pretty clear where she stands. Here's a more direct quote where she discusses reasons to doubt your interpretation:
You earlier stated that this was ""good news"" and suggested that these weren't actually serious attacks, but that interpretation isn't supported by existing research. Its pretty clear from the citation you used (which you reproduced almost verbatim), and from your previous statements that you want to present this in order to suggest these are mild incidents. My interpretation isn't really important. The interpretation of relevant experts is that these responses don't necessarily mean that these incidents were any less criminal or less damaging for the victims.
The statement you offered is not incorrect, its just misleading and lacking in important context. You say your goal is to provide more detail, but you seem to be arguing against including a whole lot of important information from reliable sources.

Forceable Rape is your interpretation - not necessarily that of the respondents.  Furthermore the vast majority of the survey classified incidents didn't fall into that category. See how your own biases intrude on what should be a neutral presentation of the findings?  Can you even concede that some lesser incidents like touching may also not be that significant to the respondents?  I think my proposed language is neutral, conforms to what are in several reliable sources (nuanced or not) and doesn't fall prey to POV editorializing that you propose. As I already stated, '''not one''' of the sources commenting on the survey include your interpretation.  Frankly, I think I've done enough to justify reinserting that sentence and will provide a few news reports as sources.  If you disagree, take it up with the RSN.

<user_id=Nblund>
Forcible rape is defined elsewhere in this article  these respondents said that someone used physical force or the threat of force to sexually penetrate them. This is rape by any definition, and the majority of these victims said it was ""not serious enough to report"". Other sources, including academic ones and the popular sources you just cited, have noted this fact in their reporting that state, and one source even noted that it might be a product of ""victim blaming"". Multiple reliable academic sources have provided exactly that interpretation of this exact same survey question.

<user_id=Nblund>
I think an RfC would make sense here  the problem isn't really with the reliability of the sources, its with the neutrality of your proposed edit. You've turned down what seems like a perfectly reasonable compromise with essentially no justification, just summarily re-adding the information seems pretty tendentious.

<user_id=Mattnad>
Well on that we can disagree (neutrality and tendentiousness). What I've proposed is virtually the same as what many news sources have written.  You've claimed that it was not notable or opion, but as demonstrated it's a very common point that reliable sources bring up.  You've fixated on the original source as a means to suggest I have some POV motive, but have no answer to how it's violating neutrality when it's commonly presented and consistent with the survey as well.  And where you and I also differ, is you want to add something that's not mentioned by any of the reliable sources in relation to this survey and is WP:Undue and arguably WP:OR and WP:Fringe.

<user_id=Nblund>
That's not really true: several of the sources point out that this ""not serious"" response was common even in the majority of rapes, and several of the news articles include a discussion of barriers of shame, self-blame and embarrassment posed by reporting  they're still imperfect for an encyclopedia, but they hint at exactly the scholarly consensus I've pointed to here.
You're adamant that this particular fact must be included in response to this particular study, but you still haven't explained why  we shouldn't mention that the same criticism has been applied to other research.  Why not cite the previous statements from other critics of this type of research, and also cite the academic response? Your formulation gives the misleading impression that this is new, unusual, or unexplained, when, in fact, its a very unsurprising result that is consistent with previous work. Why do you think this is more informative than my proposal?

<user_id=Mattnad>
The barriers to reporting for some doesn't negate the responses of others who didn't think it was serious enough to report.  However, we can include that roughly 35% (if memory serves me) in the article if you like since it was brought up in a couple of reliable sources.

<user_id=Mattnad>
Now, you've said I'm trying to bring in a criticism with this stat of the non-reporting finding.  It's not.  That's your interpretation. I'm going to guess here, but I think you feel that way because it makes the 1 in 5 less impactful. To me, and many reliable sources, the non reporting reasons reflect how the men and women felt about the incident. The qualification you are proposing comes from a POV perspective.  To whit, your sources explicitly mention the ""feminist"" reaction; per Fisher, ""For feminists, however, such a response may merely indicate a false consciousness expressed by women acculturated to see their victimization as somehow acceptable. ...""  If the news reports had brought this up in regard to this study, I'd say we can include it, with qualification on who's making the statement (as an opinion/theory). But none did, which to me suggests your proposal is just as POV as something that comes from a right wing think tank.  But I'll stress again this particular detail you don't want is very common in non-partisan coverage of the survey.

<user_id=Nblund>
You're fundamentally misunderstanding what NPOV means: it doesn't prohibit us from mentioning the views of experts, even if those experts happen to be feminists. In fact, NPOV ''requires'' that we mention the relevant views in a dispute. And yes: I'm concerned that it makes the findings appear less impactful by misleading people. I'm not quite sure why you think this isn't a valid concern.

<user_id=Nblund>
This is now the third or fourth time that I've said this: I'm not calling for excluding this detail. Quite the opposite: I've said we should discuss it in detail, and in relation to multiple studies. If you can't accept this compromise, or just want to continue arguing without acknowledging that its been offered, then I think its time we called for an RfC.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The discussion revolves around the interpretation and presentation of survey data related to campus sexual assault, specifically the reasons why victims may not report incidents and the prevalence of such incidents.

2. User Mattnad is advocating for the inclusion of a statistic from the AAU survey that indicates a majority of respondents did not report their assault because they did not consider it serious enough. Mattnad argues that this detail provides important context to the overall statistics and is supported by multiple news sources.

3. User Nblund raises concerns that presenting this statistic without additional context may be misleading. Nblund argues that the interpretation that these incidents are not serious is not supported by the consensus among experts in the field, who suggest that victims often downplay serious incidents due to guilt, shame, or embarrassment.

4. Both users present sources to support their arguments. Mattnad cites news articles that mention the statistic in question, while Nblund references academic work and the views of experts in the field.

5. The discussion touches on issues of neutrality, original research, and undue weight, with both users expressing concern that the other's preferred presentation may skew the reader's understanding of the survey results.

6. The dialogue shows a progression where both users refine their arguments and respond to each other's points. There is an attempt to reach a compromise, with Nblund suggesting that the detail be discussed in relation to multiple studies and the broader scholarly consensus.

7. The discussion is civil, with both users maintaining a respectful tone and focusing on the content and presentation of the information rather than personal attacks.

8. The quality of the arguments is generally high, with both users providing evidence for their positions and engaging with the opposing viewpoint. The discussion is coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.5",8.5

POV: mass murder is not equal to genocide

<user_id=The Banner>
This article is rather POV, as it mentions several mass murders who were in no way related to genocide. A severe clean up is needed here! For example, the ''Dirty War in Argentina'', ''Zanzibar'' and ''Expulsion of Germans after World War II'' are despicable, but no deliberate attempt to kill off a specific group of people.  

<user_id=Calthinus>
You seem to misunderstand the premise of this page. If a reasonably notable source alleges that it is genocide, it goes on the page. The page isn't stating necessarily that every item is confirmed genocide.

<user_id=The Banner>
In that case, you better remove the definition of genocide because that definitions clearly excludes the three examples I have mentioned.  

<user_id=TheTimesAreAChanging>
Yes, the Dirty War is obviously not a genocide, but ""The judge who presided over the case, Carlos Rozanski, described the offences as part of a systematic attack that was intended to destroy parts of society that the victims represented and as such it was genocide"".

<user_id=The Banner>
So, as soon as ''somebody'' names ''something'' a genocide and gets some publicity with it, it is a genocide?    get some itches about those pro-life activists that murder doctors because the perform completely legal abortusses what those activists call genocide

<user_id=TheTimesAreAChanging>
That's how the article is currently written, yes:   ""An accusation of genocide is certainly not taken lightly and will almost always be controversial. The following list of genocides and alleged genocides should be understood in this context and cannot be regarded as the final word on these subjects.""  Is that a good thing?  I don't know.  Probably some of these sections could be removed as WP:FRINGE.

<user_id=Calthinus>
It greatly helps keep the page neutral though, as it keeps the page from taking a stance on which ones are and aren't genocides. If that weren't here, and the page stated that every event listed was a genocide, this page would have seriously edit war problems, among plenty of others...

<user_id=The Banner>
I am trying to locate the book ""Wat is genocide?"" (September 2009) that was used on the Dutch Wikipedia. They recently slashed the article about genocide, based on this book witten by Maria van Haperen from the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies. In fact, their criteria are now twofold: mentioned in that book or being prosecuted/under prosecution of the International Criminal Court. I look further...  

<user_id=NeoRetro>
There is still a discussion going on on the Dutch page for this article, and there are some (including me) that are vehemently opposed to using just a single source for a major topic like this one. If you ask me, the Dutch page has just deteriorated heavily with this edit lately, based on a SINGLE source that no one even can verify. It's not even based on any scientific publication, just a reader for a bachelor's course. Please don't pull the English page down with these ridiculous arguments as well.

<user_id=Calthinus>
Looking at the Dutch page, that page has problems. One of the biggest is their chart of genocides, with its aggressor column, under which whole ethnic and religious groups are labeled ""aggressors"", implying that every ethnicityA person is guilty even if they didn't participate or even opposed the actions of their kinsmen (probably in some government or army) who perpetrated crimes against people of ethnicityB. I see that, and think that this is definitely not a page English Wikipedia should emulate... And by the way, that list is far more arbitrary than the one here. They omit various genocides that actually have official recognition, and yet they include things such as the Lebanese Muslims and Christians somehow simultaneously performing genocide upon one another (which is uncited on the page as well). I think perhaps the incomplete Dutch Wikipedia article should use the English Wikipedia as a model, not the other way around, especially considering that the Dutch page uses 3 references, whereas its English counterpart uses over 400.

<user_id=The Banner>
Don't forget to tell them dat you are already POV-pushing for years in your perennial attempts to get the use of atomic bombs in Japan into teh article, against broad consensus.  

<user_id=The Banner>
I don't thin ENWP could think as a rolemodel at all. I guess at least half of the mentioned genocides fails the definition given in the lead. But as soon ''somebody'' calls ''something'' an genocide, it is added to the list. Would you add the murder of John F. Kennedy to the list, when there is enough publicity to say so?  

<user_id=Calthinus>
Well, not just anybody. Most of the items on this list are either officially recognized, recognized by important people or relevant organizations, or at least recognized by some academics (and the page excludes cases where the academic in question used a definition of genocide that's different from the normal one, such as Afghanistan).

<user_id=Calthinus>
As I skim this list here, there are some that look iffy. I removed the India/Pakistan partition, due to lack of sourcing.

<user_id=Calthinus>
Basically, the de facto standard here is that a reasonable source must say it. The source can be biased- many of them are- but it has to be a source that we can use on wikipedia (as opposed to some lay person or worse, some wikipedia editor).

<user_id=SinhaYugaya>
Accepting biased sources is not staying neutral. It's giving in to these individual biases. The article should be renamed ""Claimed genocides in history"" if that's the basis for inclusion. A better indication would be using credible sources like the United Nations, NGOs and national governments.

<user_id=Khazar2>
Since this discussion appears to have come to a halt (one comment in six weeks), I've removed the neutrality tag per the instructions at Template:POV:

<user_id=Khazar2>
This template is not meant to be a permanent resident on any article. Remove this template whenever:
There is consensus on the talkpage or the NPOV Noticeboard that the issue has been resolved
It is not clear what the neutrality issue is, and no satisfactory explanation has been given

<user_id=Khazar2>
If editors feel there are still issues here that need to be resolved, please feel free to restore the tag and continue discussion/editing to resolve them. Cheers!

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The Banner raises a concern about the inclusion of certain events on a list of genocides, arguing that they do not meet the definition of genocide. This is a valid point, as precision in language and categorization is important in academic discussions.

2. Calthinus responds by explaining the criteria for inclusion on the page, which is based on whether a notable source has alleged an event to be genocide. This is a reasonable approach for a Wikipedia page, which aims to be a summary of available information rather than an arbiter of truth.

3. The Banner suggests that the definition of genocide on the page contradicts the inclusion of certain events. This is a coherent argument that points to a potential inconsistency in the article.

4. TheTimesAreAChanging provides a specific example of a judge describing an event as genocide, which supports the inclusion criteria mentioned by Calthinus. This adds depth to the discussion by showing how the criteria are applied in practice.

5. The Banner questions the threshold for what constitutes a notable claim of genocide, expressing concern about the potential for any claim to be included. This is a relevant concern for maintaining the quality and credibility of the article.

6. Calthinus and NeoRetro discuss the neutrality and sourcing of the page, with Calthinus defending the current approach as a way to avoid edit wars and maintain neutrality. NeoRetro criticizes the reliance on a single source in the Dutch Wikipedia and warns against similar practices in the English version. Both points are relevant to the discussion of how to handle controversial topics on Wikipedia.

7. The Banner and Calthinus discuss the potential for bias in sources and the criteria for inclusion. Calthinus clarifies that the sources must be reasonable and meet Wikipedia's standards for use. This is an important clarification for understanding the editorial standards of the page.

8. SinhaYugaya suggests that the article should be renamed to reflect that it lists claimed genocides, which would be a more accurate title given the inclusion criteria. This is a constructive suggestion that could improve the clarity of the article's scope.

9. Khazar2 removes the neutrality tag after a period of inactivity, following Wikipedia's guidelines for such tags. This is a procedural action that is part of the Wikipedia editing process.

Overall, the discussion involves a mix of valid concerns, clarifications of Wikipedia's policies, and suggestions for improvement. The participants engage with each other's points, and there is a clear effort to adhere to Wikipedia's standards for neutrality and verifiability. The discussion could benefit from more direct engagement with the specific examples raised by The Banner and a more thorough exploration of the implications of including or excluding certain events.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Idiosyncracies

<user_id=Esoglou>
This article is about coats of arms, not directly about emblems.
A website of an office of the Holy See that does not indicate a coat of arms of the Holy See is no proof that the Holy See has no coat of arms.  To state that a coat of arms of the Holy See exists or does not exist, Wikipedia requires a statement to that effect by a reliable source.  There are reliable sources that state that the Holy See does have a coat of arms and indicate what it is.  No reliable source states that the Holy See has no coat of arms.
An editor has claimed: ""Papal emblems such as the three-tiered cross, keys, tiara and umbraculum are known to have even earlier origins dating to the late thirteenth century.""  That requires citation of a reliable source.  The ""three-tiered cross"" is considered by some sources to be relative modern.  See this source.

<user_id=User16052013>
The information about the coat of arms was not removed, however, since the Holy See seems to only use an emblem and not a coat of arms currently it should be updated to include the modern information. The one book you consistently rely on is almost a century old. Things change over time, and an encyclopedia should also inform people of things that have happened after 1930. The emblem is what is currently used, the emblem should appear.

<user_id=Esoglou>
Seems is not enough for editing Wikipedia.  See WP:OR and WP:RS.  Count the cited sources that speak of and describe the coat of arms of the Holy See: Galbreath, Pastoureau, Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, Goodall, the Heraldry Society, Heim, Flags of the World.  That's a bit more than one.  You cannot cite even one single source that says there is no coat of arms of the Holy See.  If you find one, then and only then will be the time for you to edit the article in line with that reliable source.

<user_id=Esoglou>
If you wish, you may start a distinct article on the emblem of the Holy See, but this article is about the coat of arms.

<user_id=User16052013>
Your claims are dubious and misleading:

<user_id=User16052013>
(1) Flags of the World is a forum, and can not be used as a source.
(2) The Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali would be a good source, but you don't actually link to an article.
(3) Archbishop Heim wrote an opinion that there should be a difference between the arms of the Holy See and Vatican State. Examples show that the arms of both entities were drawn without concern for the placement of the gold and silver keys.
(4) The Heraldry Society actually states the arms, drawn by Archbishop Heim nonetheless, of the Papacy and of the Vatican State are with the gold key in bend and the silver in bend sinister, when this article states the silver is in bend and the gold in bend sinister. See here.
(5) Galbreath is a good source, and his book states that the keys are both silver, then found gold, then found gold and silver with examples of the gold key in bend or in bend sinister. He gives evidence that the keys have a long history of being fluid in their depictions.
(6) The Vatican has only issued information about the Holy See having an emblem currently, see here.
(7) The Vatican hasn't issued any information of late that would suggest the Holy See still uses a coat of arms. When I say ''seems'', I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that the Holy See still has arms and haven't removed that information.
(8) You can not seem to find a contemporary source that says the Holy See still has arms, and rely on information published as far back as a century ago.
(9) You constantly ignore the most recent publication issued by the Vatican itself  from September of 2013. This article is not about what the arms were in 1930, it's about the entire history. That includes 2013.

<user_id=Esoglou>
Your idea that the Flags of the World site was a forum or wiki was once mine, but I was proved wrong.  See the archives and read what Palnatoke said on 10 August 2012, showing that it is reckoned a reliable source for Wikipedia.  And it isn't the only source. The essential thing is that there is no source whatever that says the Holy See has no coat of arms, and there are many that say there is such a thing.
This article is about the coat of arms of the Holy See, not about the symbol/emblem that, every agrees, it (also) has.  The documentation of the Holy See Press Office on the official website of the Holy See gives an emblem of the Holy See, but, in spite of your insistence to the contrary, ''it does not say the Holy See has no coat of arms''.
Perhaps an example will make this even more clear.  The harp, as an emblem of Ireland, is on the reverse of Irish coins, both euro and pre-euro (see images here).  In various colours the emblem appears on government documents and letters and on Irish passports.  None of these deny that there is a coat of arms of Ireland.  There ''is'' a coat of arms of Ireland, blazoned ''azure a harp or, stringed argent''.
So you still have found not even one single reliable source that denies the existence of a coat of arms of the Holy See.
And why have you deleted information based on reliable sources?  What could be more reliable for the coat of arms of arms of Vatican City State than the picture of it in its Fundamental Law?  So why did you delete the information about that?  Why did you delete the information on the crossed keys and tiara appearing as a coat of arms in the 14th century?  Why did you ignore here on the talk page Galbreath's statement that the position of the gold key in bend and the silver one in bend sinister became established and practically made him say the opposite?  Goodall says the same, but you present him practically as saying the opposite: don't you understand that ""the practice of placing a gold key in bend over another in bend sinister of silver is not found with any certainty before the time of Pius II (1458-64)"" means that this had become the practice by, at latest, 1460 or thereabouts, five and a half centuries ago?

<user_id=Esoglou>
Your mistaken edits must once again be reverted until you have them discussed on the talk page.  Discussion does not mean merely setting forth your merely personal ideas without waiting for a reply.
As well as taking out what is sourced why have you again inserted unsourced claims.

<user_id=50.82.40.97>
Those links are to a google search, that isn't reliable. Please find actual sources. Just becuase Google links to something does not make it reliable.

<user_id=Esoglou>
Those links are to printed books and printed official documents such as the Funbdamental Law of the Church.  There is no rational reason to delete them.  And there is no rational reason under Wikipedia rules for inserting claims that have no basis in any published source.

<user_id=50.82.40.97>
No, they are links to a google search. They don't link to a book that can be open, read and verified.
The Italian Cultural Ministry link doesn't even exist, I don't know how you can think that is a source.
The other sources just use a surname, no book and publishing information. No book, no source.
Find actual sources.

<user_id=Esoglou>
Please explain what you mean.  Have you actually failed to understand that it is normal practice to refer by the surname of the author and the date of publication to books given in a bibliography or already mentioned in an article?   Don't you understand that ""Galbreath 1930"" refers to Donald L. Galbreath: ''Papal Heraldry''. Cambridge, 1930; Heffer and Sons, which has been mentioned a few lines above?  Don't you understand that ""Heim 1978"" refers to Bruno Heim: ''Heraldry in the Catholic Church: Its Origins, Customs and Laws''. Gerrards Cross: Van Duren, 1978, which has been mentioned a few lines above?  Can't you understand that Appendix B (""All. B. Stemma Ufficiale dello Stato della Città del Vaticano"") of the Fundamental Law of Vatican City State, 7 June 1929 is a reliable source?  And so on.  What makes you think these are not actual sources, highly reliable sources in fact?

<user_id=50.82.40.97>
All of that publication information isn't in the works cited section or in the article. It's definitely not ""mentioned a few lines above"", the works cited because that is a ""See also"" section. It doesn't matter if ''you'' know what it means, it matters that ''everyone'' knows what it means. Stop being an condescending arrogant ass, because people unfamiliar with this subject still use this website and they might not know who those people are. If you think you are so smart, then fill out a goddamn works cited like any high school student is required to do.

<user_id=50.82.40.97>
And it is not normal practice to refer to the surname only of an author in a works cited. The surname is used only in the actual essay, unless two or more works by the same author are used, in which case the title or surname with the title are to be used to avoid confusion. One then uses that surname to locate the publication and full information in the works cited. You just don't go around using a surname without telling people who that person is and what he wrote.

<user_id=50.82.40.97>
And if you would actrually read what I and other editors have told you, you would know the issues with the sources. Go read ""a few lines up"" because you ""failed to understand"" what people have told you. Is English a third or fourth language to you?

<user_id=Esoglou>
If the use of the surname and date of publication is a problem to you, you can be accommodated by repeating the full name of the author and the book each time the book is mentioned.  And if giving references in, for instance, the form Donald Lindsay Galbreath, ''A Treatise on Ecclesiastical Heraldry'' (W. Heffer and Sons, 1930), Volume 1, p. 9 is a problem for you, you can be accommodated by giving them in the form Donald Lindsay Galbreath, ''A Treatise on Ecclesiastical Heraldry'' (W. Heffer and Sons, 1930), Volume 1, p. 9 a form that you can reach simply by clicking on what you get by using the other form.  Is there anything else you want changed?  As you see, I am willing to accommodate you.  Discussion, not deletion, is the way to obtain fixing of whatever you believe is wrong and others do not.  So far, you have not explained why you deleted the account of the picture of the Vatican City State arms given in the Fundamental Law of the state.  If you think it in some way inaccurate, say so and bring that also to discussion.  You have looked at the picture, surely.

<user_id=50.82.40.97>
Yeah, duh, if you are going to cite a book you should put the name of the book in the references section, not just the authors surname. Hell, a full name would also be an improvement to what you put down. After all, the page number you entered is useless if we don't know what book or publication you are referencing. You're kidding that you didn't think this was a necessity? And a link to a google search doesn't count as a reference. If you are using web sources, sind the actual book and not excerpts that show up in a google search.

<user_id=50.82.40.97>
Whatever I ""believe is wrong and others do not""? The reason you have had to revert this page so many times is because several editors have disagreed with your version you keep protecting. They ceased making edits not because they realized you were right, but because you are unable to discuss any information that you disagree with. Looking at the past conversations, when someone has told you something you have even come to the conclusion of the exact opposite you were told. You are incapable of any meaningful discussion.

<user_id=Esoglou>
I have now restored the deleted material while changing the styles to yours.  I hope this is satisfactory.

<user_id=Esoglou>
To please an editor who objects to the word ""blazoned"", I have replaced it with ""described"" in reporting the depiction of the Vatican City State arms given in its Fundamental Law.  I have of course also restored the well-sourced information that was deleted without explanation, and removed the repetition of the section headed ""Vatican City State arms"".

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Source Reliability and Citation**: The discussion revolves heavily around the reliability of sources and the proper citation of those sources. User Esoglou emphasizes the importance of reliable sources and points out that there are multiple sources that affirm the existence of a coat of arms for the Holy See, while there are none that deny it. User16052013 and User 50.82.40.97 challenge the reliability of some sources and the adequacy of the citations provided. The insistence on reliable sourcing and proper citation is a strong point in the discussion, as it is fundamental to Wikipedia's standards.

2. **Historical Consistency**: User Esoglou argues for the historical consistency of the coat of arms and its established depiction, referencing sources that date back to the 14th century and earlier. This argument is important for the topic at hand, which is historical in nature. However, User16052013 points out the need for contemporary sources and the importance of reflecting modern usage, which is also a valid point in the context of an encyclopedia that should be up-to-date.

3. **Adherence to Wikipedia Policies**: User Esoglou references Wikipedia's policies on original research (WP:OR) and reliable sources (WP:RS), which is a strong argumentative strategy as it aligns with the platform's guidelines. This shows an understanding of Wikipedia's framework for content creation and editing.

4. **Personal Attacks and Civility**: The discussion deteriorates at points with User 50.82.40.97 resorting to personal attacks and uncivil language. This detracts from the overall quality of the discussion, as it moves away from constructive debate and towards hostility.

5. **Willingness to Accommodate**: User Esoglou shows a willingness to accommodate the concerns of other users by offering to change citation styles and clarify references. This is a positive aspect of the discussion, as it demonstrates a collaborative approach to resolving disputes.

6. **Clarity and Coherence**: The discussion suffers from a lack of clarity and coherence at times, with users talking past each other and not fully addressing each other's points. This makes it difficult to follow the arguments and assess their validity.

Overall, the discussion has elements of strong argumentation, particularly in the emphasis on source reliability and adherence to Wikipedia policies. However, the quality is diminished by instances of incivility, unclear references, and a lack of coherence in the dialogue.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Casting the neutrality of this into dispute. Time for overhaul?

<user_id=Mike4ty4>
I don't like this. It seems to be advocating various nonstandard physical theories such as Andrei Sakharov's alternative gravitation theories. As it seems to be slanted toward these theories (as opposed to not having a slant at all), it feels as though it runs afoul of Wikipedia's Neutrality policies (NPOV). Does anyone here agree, and does anyone want to do something about it? It also suggests that zpf somehow is incompatible with the law of conservation of energy and that this presents a significant problem in physics. Yet I've never heard of an incompatibility between zpf and conservation of energy  this sounds like some sort of ""Original Research"" that is not appropriate for WP. Anyone really, really knowledgeable about physics in all the relevant areas want to examine the claims made on the page? They seem a little suspect. I also noted cites of Harold Puthoff, whom I consider suspicious as he seems to be ""convinced"" that Uri Geller's ""psychic"" claims are valid  yet from what I've seen, Geller has been pretty thoroughly debunked and exposed as an outright fraud and con man, though this of course is no substitute for a logical exam of his claims (though that itself is beyond the scope of WP  WP is concerned with reporting on things, not investigating their validity or lack thereof.). It just adds to the growing overall atmosphere of suspectness/dubiousness of the things expounded about on this page. I also find some statements on here a little odd. E.g. ""In recent years, it has been suggested that the electromagnetic zero-point field is not merely an artifact of quantum mechanics, but a real entity with major implications for gravity, astrophysics and technology."" However I'm not sure what physicists would call the zpf ""merely"" an ""artifact"" as though it were unimportant. I could be wrong on this, of course. And ""One cannot invoke another world or universe to justify unjustifiable fluctuations just when it is useful to solve an inconvenient problem, as in the many worlds philosophy of quantum mechanics."" This seems like a strange and peculiar slam at Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory  I have not heard of MWI being used as a ""cop out"" to push away inconvenient problems. Again I could be wrong, but this just doesn't seem good.
A great deal of information has been put into this article, making it highly complex and difficult to figure out what should be kept and rejected (there might be good stuff buried in there after all), and I think someone with both good expertise in physics and good neutrality should go over this and get it up to spec with Wikipedia policy.

Mike, there are many things you've said that don't seem to add up to a valid criticism. The main criticism seems to be that the information is non-standard. It seems to be based on the idea that all points of view should always be represented, even when subject is about one particular thing. Sakharov's representation of the zpf is one of the main sources of knowledge of the ZPF. Even now his paper on induced gravity is being referenced in a course on general relativity for cosmology at the Perimeter Institute, perhaps the leading foundational research facility for physics in the world.

<user_id=75.7.12.4>
If you haven't understood that the zpf requires a huge assortment of unproven simultaneous things to make it unobserved then you just aren't thinking.

<user_id=75.6.255.139>
Mike, I'm afraid you didn't answer any of my rebuttals to your original challenge.  Until you answer my rebuttal arguments to the complaints YOU BROUGHT UP I will be reversing your banner in a little less  than a week. You defined the stage of battle and that is the stage I've acquiesced to and am argueing on. Now you want to change that stage because you know you don't know the history and cutting edge questions in physics today. Start answering my rebuttal in a physics context. This subject is about the physics of the zpf and not about physics that you might have read about 30 years ago. Established knowledge moves on, and that is what I've presented. You will have to move on also, your ignorance of modern physics and your perverse pride in that fact not withstanding. Eric Habegger

<user_id=Mike4ty4>
This is not about the validity of the physics. The questions are about whether this is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia and in the way it is being included right here. That is what this is about. Also, what top, leading-edge physicists support all your views and theories? You say this is the cutting edge, so then it should be known to the top physics renowned the entire world over. You say it's ""established"" knowledge, so then you should find few physicists today that disagree with it. Do you? And there is no ""perverse pride"", that's crap and you know it. But you can call that a lie of course or something like that, so I'll never be able to convince you. And if I don't know enough about physics where the hell can I get more knowledge about it that would be more ""current""? Apparently every source I've gone to to learn anything about physics and so on is all 30 years out of date regardless of the dates on them?! (Of course that's totally irrelevant to the WP policy issue.)

<user_id=Mike4ty4>
Also, why don't you answer the questions, such as where am I saying that ZPF has not been observed, for example?

<user_id=Mike4ty4>
So you believe the ZPF energy density actually goes down as the universe expands, so as to conserve energy? Or what? Also, the CMB radiation is not the ZPF, either. It's essentially leftover photons from the Big Bang. The ZPF of the EM field is what you're left with if you were to remove ALL photons (that's why it's called ''zero-point'' field!). As the volume of the universe increases the photons get more widely spread and also redshifted.

<user_id=Mike4ty4>
No, I'm not an ""expert"" in physics. But what I'm really after here is the appropriateness of the material for WP, which does not depend on the scientific validity of the theory involved.

<user_id=BenRG>
Eric, this article is such a mess that I don't know where to begin. I prefer to end content disputes by coming to an agreement about the content, but I think that's hopeless in this case, so I'm going to stick with policy. Wikipedia is not the place to publish revolutionary paradigm-shifting ideas in physics. That's not what it is about. You can write about them on your own web site, or you can write an overview paper and try to get a journal to publish it; you just can't publish it here.

<user_id=Mike4ty4>
That's correct, that's what this is about: what's compatible with WP policy. I suppose if there was to be an ""agreement"" about the content, then he'd have to agree to that, and that would involve sticking only to published research and sticking to the neutral point of view.

<user_id=75.6.255.139>
BenRG, I think you should be much more specific about it being a ""mess"". As one example, the last section in which I mentioned the ratios of lengths that Feynman brought up, but with the only contradiction being ""G"". Now, it can be just left at that but we know more now than he did that there really is a cosmological constant that fits and that it isn't zero. He assumed G had to be right because he thought the cc was zero. It seems to me I'm just asking an ordinary question if G really is correct if we now know there really isn't a balance of positive zpf energy and something that completely cancels it. Is asking that question and delving into the suspected answer to be considered just a ""mess"" considering the fact that changing ""G"" would clear up just about every other conctradiction between gravitational physics and quantum physics? It does not seem like an arcane or complicated subject to be investigated even if there are not direct references.
How do you want to handle the ""G"" question? I have a feeling there are references related to this question that are relevant but I don't know where they are. You are assuming there are no references to this and that therefore the question cannot be asked. I would say the task for you is to find the references that are closest and then modify the subject matter to those references rather than do a wholesale alteration. I've put a huge amount of work into this article. Couldn't you make a small effort to find those references. The previous banner to have it wikified was justified but you are assuming its my job to do everything and if ""I"" don't do it then it has to be sort of destroyed. It seems to me the wiki community is just letting the article dangle in the wind by not contributing substantively with links and references. That's what the Wikify banner was suppose to promote.

<user_id=Mike4ty4>
References are needed per WP policy. Furthermore, you should've put the references in while writing the thing, and also minded the neutrality. If you don't know where these references are, then I want to know where you're getting the information from that you have put in here. If it was in a book or paper or something, then that would be an initial first choice for a reference, but you might want to also consult Wikipedia's reliable references guidelines to determine if it would be up to snuff. If it's something you came up with yourself, then it's not suitable for Wikipedia unless someone else already came up with it and it is somewhere in a reference or you have had it published elsewhere in a sufficiently reliable outlet, all per WP's no original research policy.

<user_id=75.6.251.17>
I think you have assumed wrongly, in combination with my lack of references, that the main substance represents new research. But it is mostly just a different, and more physical approach to the subject. But it still seems to me that if both you and BenRG want to be constructive and not destructive, you would find the applicable references from the names I mentioned, including Feynman, and then harmonize the article regarding ""G"" with those references. I hereby assign you that job because Wiki is a group effort and no one person can do it all. I also still think that the Wikify banner covers the problems, including references, in this article. I think both of you have jumped the gun in declaring it POV without trying to find the references yourselves. If no references can be found for some of the subject material, THEN it may be profitably removed. Intuitive physical understanding and technical mathematic underpinnings often are two ways of describing the same things and I think you might be surprised how much reference material there is between the two things.

<user_id=75.6.251.17>
Research in the term ""original 'research'"" is a little more broad than that: what Wikipedia means by the term original research includes ""unpublished facts, arguments, speculation, and ideas; and any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to advance a position."" So the first question then is: is this ""approach"" (which I'd say would be an ""idea"") published in ''any'' source outside of Wikipedia? If so, what sources? The sources must agree with the reliability guidelines. There is also a ""burden"" on the poster of material to provide the necessary sources and citations, as well. I don't have access to academic libraries, so I myself might not be able to do the proper research to verify the claims and/or provide the necessary sources. Though I know I might not be able to, I nonetheless also know this likely can't be on here at least not the way it is written. Yet I see an awful lot of statements that seem to be making conclusions (some I mentioned) and statements that don't have references added, and that is what I was coming here to point out. So I'll ask again: where are you getting the information from? Where did you get all those statements from? As if you were getting them from a book, paper, etc. you could have referenced it, provided it met the reliability guidelines. You would not have to go and do some digging somewhere because you'd have the material right there!

<user_id=75.6.251.17>
My proposal is this: both of you try to find ""in good faith"" the references to the problems you see in the article. I'm talking about references in established respected media and journals that agree with the article. One can always find references from prior knowledge that is out of date and that does not count. This probably will take a long time if you do that and then harmonize it with them. In the meantime I propose to delete the POV banner on the original timetable if you agree with that. In this way you will no longer have a problem with me taking over the subject matter for this article and you will be contributing substantively to the article and increasing your own knowledge of subject simultaneously. May I suggest you watch Feynman's first Messenger Lecture on the TUVA site for your first introduction to the G problem.
So where are you saying all this stuff came from, if not such media and journals?
What I'd suggest is that you should first review the neutrality policy, which among other things means that conclusions cannot be advanced in Wikipedia articles, and also that opinions in disputes must be weighted according to how widely they are held. And also the original research and verifiability policies, if you haven't done so already. If you have, my apologies, I just don't know. If these views and theories are not mainstream (though you called it ""established"" in one post), then they might not belong or might be only briefly referenceable in this article about ""zero-point field"", per the weighting guidelines section of the neturality policies, which is about that subject in general not a specific theory about it. If they are notable enough, they might be deserving of a distinct article. Even if not worth their own article, they may be includable in another existing article or articles  I'm not sure what they'd fall under as I haven't seem a name for the theories. I'd say you should consult with other Wikipedia editors, who may be able to advise you further in determining, for example, the notability of the theories, getting better references, presenting it from a neutral point of view, etc.
Finally, as long as this argument is still ongoing, I'd suggest the banner be retained as the argument/""dispute"" is still going.

<user_id=Mike4ty4>
I know it wasn't addressed to me but I thought I'd offer my comment. Also, it's not an ""emotional response"" to anything, it is rather a response based on what appears to be things that aren't suitable for Wikipedia ''per its policies''. Those policies are there regardless of any ""emotional response"". Also, you may wish to review the definition of the ""wikify"": Wikipedia:Glossary#Wikify ""To format using Wiki markup (as opposed to plain text or HTML) and add internal links to material [i.e. to other Wikipedia articles], incorporating it into the whole of Wikipedia."" If there was any ""emotional response"" it would likely have been to a few certain key claims, for example to the inclusion of giving certain views which I consider highly ""pseudoscientific"" a free pass in the ""Related"" section by saying ""some consider them pseudoscience"" but only in the middle of stuff that seems to buttress it. This ""emotional response"" though would be more because the views seem highly against science, esp. the ""messages in water"" thing whose discoverer even ''admits'' to the use of selective methodology in, which is pretty much useless insofar as determing if any phenomena are really occuring. Also, perhaps there was some ""emotional response"" that came later, when you seemed to refuse to answer questions in the above section about, for example, how ''your'' theories resolve claimed ""pradoxes"" like the constant zpf density vs nonconstant cosm volume thing, more like frustration really. However, emotional responses are an aside: the issue still remains, regardless of them, the compliance or lack thereof of this article with Wikipedia policy. Do you see what I am talking about?

<user_id=Mike4ty4>
I'm curious: have you subjected ''your'' ideas to the exact same level of rigorous examination you'd want me to subject mine to?

<user_id=75.6.251.17>
I'm a believer in giving people what they think they want. Only that way do they learn the hard work and contentious issues that come up. Therefore I will no longer contribute to this article or to Wiki. I'm only suggesting that you, or you and BenRG do the research on references that back up the information in the article. That way you'll have a clear conscience instead of just deleting things and suffering the consequences from others. I think I've had it with Wiki from this experience with you. Take it over and you and BenRG can make it into whatever you want. I don't want to turn into a defensive person by having to deal with blanket accusations from the both of you after doing so much work gratis. Bye. Eric Habegger

<user_id=Mike4ty4>
This is not ""accusations"", I'm just pointing out what the policy says, and why this doesn't seem to conform. You failed to tell me what sources you got what you wrote from, which I questioned you on because you seemed to make it sound like it would be a huge hassle for you to add the references, yet if you got your stuff from some other sources, then that's what you cite and citing them would not be hard at all since you know what they are! Do you see? If you made it all up yourself then it's not suitable for Wikipedia unless you have already premiered it elsewhere that is sufficiently reliable, per the original research policy. See? That's all I'm trying to say.

<user_id=Mike4ty4>
Oh and as for suffering ""consequences"", if the consensus of the community  which is something I'm still plumbing for as it seems few others have come to weigh in on this  is to delete, there are no ""consequences"" and no unclear conscience. I have already said that I myself am not in the position to be able to do the research myself, so I ''can't'' do it. I just '''''do not have''''' the '''''ability''''' or means to do the necessary work, as I have explained to your earlier. Learn well the difference between ""not willing"" and ""''not able''"". If the consensus is to trim, then it gets trimmed. If someone else with the necessary access and ability which I lack finds sources, then sources get added. If the consensus is the article could be saved but it requires a big rewrite to meet NPOV, then that's what happens.

<user_id=Mike4ty4>
And also, if you want to preserve the work, there's nothing that says you can't take that stuff you yourself did off to a website other than Wikipedia. You can even include stuff someone else has done, provided the distribution is done in accordance with to the licensing agreements (see WP:C).

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. <user_id=Mike4ty4> raises concerns about neutrality and adherence to Wikipedia's policies, specifically NPOV (Neutral Point of View), no original research, and verifiability. He questions the validity of the content and its sources, particularly the promotion of nonstandard physical theories and the involvement of individuals with questionable credibility. His argument is based on Wikipedia's established guidelines, which is a strong basis for argumentation in this context.

2. <user_id=75.7.12.4> and <user_id=75.6.255.139> (presumably the same individual, Eric Habegger, based on the content of the messages) defend the content, arguing that it is based on knowledge from a reputable source (Sakharov) and that the criticism is unfounded. However, the defense lacks specific references to back up the claims and does not address the core issue of Wikipedia's policies on neutrality and verifiability.

3. <user_id=BenRG> supports Mike4ty4's stance on policy adherence and emphasizes that Wikipedia is not a platform for publishing original research. This reinforces the argument for neutrality and compliance with Wikipedia's guidelines.

4. <user_id=Mike4ty4> continues to press for references and adherence to policy, demonstrating a consistent and policy-driven approach to the discussion.

5. <user_id=75.6.251.17> (also Eric Habegger) suggests that others should find references to support the content he added, which is not in line with Wikipedia's policy that the burden of evidence lies with the person who adds or changes content. This weakens his argument as it shifts responsibility away from the content creator.

6. <user_id=Mike4ty4> remains consistent in his request for policy adherence and offers suggestions for how the content could potentially be improved or where it could be moved if it does not fit within the scope of the current article.

7. <user_id=75.6.251.17> expresses frustration and decides to withdraw from contributing, which does not contribute to resolving the issue at hand but rather ends the discussion without a resolution.

Overall, the arguments from Mike4ty4 and BenRG are strong because they are grounded in Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, which are the framework for content on the platform. The arguments from Eric Habegger are weaker because they do not adequately address the policy concerns and fail to provide the necessary references to support the content in question.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

NPOV re-added

<user_id=Jokestress>
I have re-added the NPOV tag following WP:COI edits by , made to align the the article with the POV of his boss coworker Ray Blanchard. I also added a reference for the word derogatory. I also believe that we should have a section called ""academic use"" vs. ""scientific/medical use."" Separating the ideologies of Ray Blanchard and Janice Raymond is a POV move. Both hold the same points of view about the terms she-male and about trans people.

<user_id=Benjiboi>
has this been resolved?

<user_id=James Cantor>
Because the scientific RS's fail to support the activists' POV, no resolution is likely without substantial input from otherwise uninvolved editors.  I recommend reading the arguments and sources, and asserting your own conclusion.

<user_id=Benjiboi>
What's the main issue in your opinion?

<user_id=James Cantor>
The main issue, in my opinion, is the use of WP by some trans activists to encourage the use of the terms they themselves prefer over the terms used by other members of the trans communities or by medical/scientific experts.  There are activists who prefer terms that indicate their womanhood (such as ''transwoman'') over terms that do not, and the term ""she-male"" contains includes the word ""male"" rather than ""female.""  The term is used non-pejoratively, however, by sex trade workers and in sex research studies.
Rather than merely indicate the alternative uses, however, the article space is becoming another WP battleground on which community activists selectively cite the uses that they prefer and attempt to discredit those who do otherwise.  (That is, instead of the article saying ''Some people use the term this way while other people use it that way'' the article is being pushed to say ''This term means only this one thing and all dissenters are transphobic.'') This pattern has played through a great many of the trans-related articles.  Rather than precipitate a repeat conflict, however, I instead encourage you to read the article and sources and come to your own opinion.

<user_id=Benjiboi>
I may be missing something here but both cases are true. It is commonly used in a derogatory fashion and, similar to other slurs, has been in part either adopted or reclaimed. It is still a despised term and any scientist who had the nerve to set up a classification would seem rather disreputable whereas just noting it as a self-descriptor by those the scientist is studying would seem acceptable similar to having a list of different labels or even a blank where someone would self-identify. Blanchard's bit, IMHO, should include that his work is maligned for such usage. Meanwhile, erotic and sex industries capitalize on the use and transwomen do identify as shemale as needed to earn money, they would also just as easily identify as almost anything else conceivable and believable to appease a customer's preference. So I think it's a little disingenuous to assert the point with more emphasis than that. IMHO, it's a temporary label - even when used as a self-descriptor - not conforming to one's self-identity as much as reclaiming a word like ""freak"" ""nigger"" and ""faggot"" to take the sting out and dis-empower ones degraders. Usage within one's circle can be seen from a sociological view but I'm quite suspicious of adopting it well beyond that or that the number of people doing so is significant.

<user_id=James Cantor>
I can suggest only that one look up the references given in the article, which do not say what the main page says they say.  For example, the main page says that the term shemale ""is often seen by transsexual people as a term of abuse"" citing as a source Herbst (2001).  Herbst (2001) does not say any such thing, however.  In fact, the only comment that Herbst makes regarding the connotation of the term is ""The term may also refer positively to androgyny.""  The second source given on the main page is an online dictionary, which has questionable status as an RS, and which says, in parentheses, ""sometimes offensive,"" which I agree with, but which is not very neutrally conveyed by 'often a term of abuse.'
In general, the term 'shemale' is considered derogatory when applied to people ''other than'' MtF folks who have socially transitioned but not undergone gential surgery (e.g., masculine lesbians or MtF folk who ''have'' completed transition).  The cites in opposition to the term are comments made by community activists who are generally postsurgical MtF folk (and, thus, for whom the term would be innaccurate and negative), who have expertise only in areas outside linguistics (such as biology), and who are expressing their personal (and non-expert) opinions about the use of the term ''for them'' rather than the use of the term ''in general''.
To repeat my earlier comment, I agree entirely with the page reflecting the mixed status of the term, but not with using the article space to actively promote the idea that the term is or is not offensive.  As a tangent, I am not actually the person who added the POV-tag to the page.  Whether the current content of the page accurately conveys what is said in the cites, or adds a spin of its own, is up to you to decide for yourself after reading the RS's.

<user_id=James Cantor>
I have asked for input regarding the online dictionaries at RS/N.

<user_id=Jokestress>
When referring to trans women, this is a term used by Janice Raymond, Ray Blanchard, J. Michael Bailey, and pornographers. Almost all trans women find the term and the people who use it abhorrent, as noted in the reliable source. Contorting this into some sort of value-neutral term is just another attempt to insert the POV of your boss colleague/buddy/etc. This article is a big mess thanks to drive-by edits. It lacks cohesion and fails WP:UNDUE by trying to present this as a value-neutral term.

<user_id=James Cantor>
When WP becomes What-Jokestress-Says-Pedia, then what Jokestress says about ""almost all trans women"" might be relevant (as if she spoke for almost all transwomen).  Meanwhile, all we have is ''some'' of the sources (of debatable reliability) saying that ''some'' people object to the term when used in ''some'' circumstances (such as when refering to lesbians).  ''None'' of the sources says anything approaching ""almost all trans women"" nor uses any term as laden as ""abhorrent.""  The RS's do, however, contain what I have already said: There are people who find the term negative and there are people who find it neutral; the article should therefore reflect that. Because ''no one'' here is presenting the term as value-neutral (I have written multiple times that the term is used different ways by different people), Jokestress is debating a mirage of her own creation.  (Missing from Jokestress list of who uses the term how are the sources (added to the page by people other than me) that also provide only neutral definitions, like Blanchard, devoid of negative connotation.)

<user_id=James Cantor>
Moreover, Blanchard and Bailey do ''not'' use the term to refer to postoperative folks, and Jokestress should either provide an RS showing they do or strike out her misstatement. Finally, although we collaborate on many projects, Blanchard is not my boss.  Jokestress should provide evidence he is, or strike that out as well.

<user_id=Jokestress>
Most transwomen find the term abhorrent. Please read the article more carefully for the source to which I referred in my earlier comment. I can provide plenty of other sources that reflect reality about this term's usage. If you have a source that says this term is a ""neutral"" way to describe trans women, please provide it.

<user_id=James Cantor>
After I point out that ''none'' of the cites support your claim, a response of ""Go find the cite yourself"" essentially proves my point.  There is no such cite.
Statements like ""I can provide plenty of other sources..."" are similarly unconvincing when unaccompanied by any actual RS's.  I would indeed encourage you, or anyone, to locate such RS's.  For what it is worth, the discussion at RS/N suggests that such RS's should be from more established sources than the online dictionaries currently appearing on the page.

<user_id=James Cantor>
As for RS's for neutral definitions: The Oxford English Dictionary makes explicit when terms have negative connotations, and the OED entry for she-male contains none of the OED's usual notes to that effect.

<user_id=James Cantor>
Finally, given that you have also failed to produce any RS's about who my boss is (nor for Blanchard or Bailey's use ''she-male''for postoperative MtF folks), you also have some striking-out to do.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Use of Reliable Sources**: The discussion revolves around the use of reliable sources (RS) to support claims. James Cantor emphasizes the importance of citing reliable sources and points out that the claims made by Jokestress are not supported by the sources she references. This insistence on adhering to Wikipedia's standards for reliable sourcing is a strong aspect of the argument.

2. **Neutral Point of View (NPOV)**: Jokestress raises concerns about edits made that could align the article with the point of view of certain individuals, which is against Wikipedia's NPOV policy. This is a valid point in the context of Wikipedia's guidelines.

3. **Relevance of Expertise**: James Cantor argues that the opinions of community activists, who may not have expertise in linguistics, should not be used to define the general use of a term. This is a relevant point when considering the weight given to different types of sources in an encyclopedia.

4. **Clarity and Misrepresentation**: James Cantor points out that certain statements made by Jokestress, such as the claim that ""almost all trans women"" find the term ""abhorrent,"" are not substantiated by the provided sources. This is a valid critique if the sources do not, in fact, support such a strong statement.

5. **Personal Accusations**: The discussion includes personal accusations, such as Jokestress's claim that Cantor is biased due to a relationship with Ray Blanchard. Cantor refutes this and asks for evidence, which is not provided. Personal accusations without evidence detract from the quality of the argument.

6. **Focus on Content**: The discussion should focus on the content of the article and the quality of the sources rather than on the individuals involved. While there are attempts to do this, the personal nature of some comments detracts from the overall quality of the discussion.

7. **Understanding of Terms**: There is a debate over the connotation of the term ""she-male"" and its usage. The discussion would benefit from a clearer understanding and presentation of how the term is used in different contexts, supported by reliable sources.

Overall, the discussion shows an attempt to engage with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, particularly regarding the use of reliable sources and maintaining a neutral point of view. However, the quality of the discussion is affected by unsubstantiated claims, personal accusations, and a lack of clear consensus on the interpretation of sources. The insistence on reliable sourcing and the relevance of expertise are strong points, while the personal nature of some comments and the lack of clear evidence for certain claims are weaknesses.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Removing ""World Pantheist Movement"" Advertising on Pantheism page

<user_id=NaturaNaturans>
Wikipedia should not be a method of advertising for an environmentalist political group that identifies with ""pantheism"".  There is no ""symbol"" of pantheism and ""The World Pantheist Movement"" picture should not be the first thing readers see when looking up pantheism.  Furthermore, there have been excessive references to ""The World Pantheist Movement"" and so-called ""naturalistic pantheism"" political views imposed onto this page.  Wikipedia readers deserve an impartial view of what pantheism is all about, not just an environmentalist political person's agenda that has little to do with what has been called pantheism for over 100 years.  (  )

<user_id=Naturalistic>
Hmmm, Allisgod aka Rev Allen White of Unity Church in Silver Spring, I thought we had progressed beyond paranoid attacks from you. I have tried to develop a cooperative approach between us dedicated to neutrality and accuracy. You have assiduously promoted your own agenda of determinism and ""Classical Pantheism"" in your contributions.

<user_id=Naturalistic>
The spiral is the pantheism symbol in widest use on planet today and the World Pantheist Movement is by a long stretch the largest pantheist organization on the planet so there's nothing unusual in mentioning it. Moreover, Naturalistic Pantheism does not get special treatment since all the forms of pantheism are mentioned and described without bias in favor of one or the other.

<user_id=Naturalistic>
By attacking the WPM in the way you do, you blatantly reveal your own biassed agenda.

<user_id=NaturaNaturans>
Certain groups of Hinduism, Taoism, Wicca, and Kabbalah, among others, are the largest pantheist groups on the planet, not an internet website soliciting donations for environmental causes.  Determinism and Classical Pantheism are not my agenda.  I happen to be an environmentalist as well and donate to environmental causes.  That doesn't mean I try to twist around a deep word born out of Spinoza's philosophy on wikipedia to promote environmental politics.  That would be what you're doing and that is unacceptable.  Wikipedia is not for self promotion.  In fact, members of the Church of Scientology were recently banned from Wikipedia for trying to control the page on Scientology.  You're taking it a step further beyond the ""World Pantheist Movement"" wikipedia page and are trying to control the ""Pantheism"" page to suit your purposes.  Your ""spiral"" is a symbol of a donation based organization used to promote itself.  That symbol does not belong on the wikipedia page on pantheism. (  )

<user_id=Naturalistic>
Okay, I agree to removing the symbols and hope that you agree to removing your panegyric of Spinoza. I would suggest a lineup of famous pantheist faces instead: Marcus Aurelius, Girodano Bruno, Spinoza, Wordsworth, Whitman, Emerson, DH Lawrence, Frank Lloyd Wright, Einstein, Margaret Atwood.
See Determinism entry for agendas.

<user_id=NaturaNaturans>
I take issue with you referring to the highlighting of Spinoza on a page on pantheism as ""panegyric"".  Pantheism is inextricably bound to no one more influential figure than Spinoza.  That is a plain fact and you cannot use a wikipedia page to attempt to mitigate the fact that the man is referenced first by just about everyone who uses the word pantheism.  If you choose to use the word in a different way and for another purpose, that's your prerogative.  But you are doing a disservice to people looking for information on wikipedia when you try and force your divergent viewpoint upon a popular information page. (  )

<user_id=Naturalistic>
Panegyric refers to the effusive language and references to prince and prophet etc. These are pure evoluations without information content. Spinoza represents one specific type of Pantheism and focussing so powerfully on him actually reduces the page's neutrality. Placing such emphasis on Hartshorne, a panentheist critic of pantheism, also distorts the page's neutrality.

<user_id=Naturalistic>
Re agendas, I have repeatedly explained what my agenda here is: neutrality, accuracy, and avoidance of personal point of view (POV) and original research (OR). I will continue to vigorously defend these Wikipedia principles which you frequently ignore and I can do so indefinitely. You have explicitly explained that your agenda is pushing Spinoza, Hartshorne and determinism. Inclusion of the largest pantheist organization in the world is natural in an article on Pantheism.

<user_id=Naturalistic>
I have repeatedly asked for cooperation, mutual respect and so on and you have continued to choose confrontation and edit wars. Until we begin to proceed on the basis of cooperation, this situation will persist. I was content to leave the page as it was about a month ago and it stayed that way for several weeks and included quite a number of changes in your direction, which I was not entirely happy with but left alone for the sake of peace and continuity.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Relevance to Topic**: Both users are discussing the content of the Wikipedia page on Pantheism, which is relevant to the topic at hand. User NaturaNaturans is concerned about the potential bias and self-promotion of the World Pantheist Movement on the Pantheism page, while User Naturalistic defends the inclusion of the organization and its symbol based on its size and relevance.

2. **Factual Accuracy**: User NaturaNaturans argues that the World Pantheist Movement is not the largest group of pantheists and that historically significant groups like certain sects of Hinduism, Taoism, etc., are larger. User Naturalistic counters by stating the World Pantheist Movement is the largest pantheist organization. This is a point of contention that would require external verification for clarity.

3. **Neutrality and Bias**: User NaturaNaturans raises a valid point about the potential for bias and self-promotion, which is against Wikipedia's guidelines. User Naturalistic argues for the inclusion of the World Pantheist Movement based on its size and the use of its symbol. The discussion about neutrality is crucial for Wikipedia's integrity.

4. **Adherence to Wikipedia Policies**: User NaturaNaturans references Wikipedia's conflict of interest policy, which is an important aspect of maintaining an unbiased and informative Wikipedia page. User Naturalistic emphasizes Wikipedia principles such as neutrality, accuracy, and avoidance of personal POV and OR.

5. **Rhetorical Strategies**: User NaturaNaturans uses a comparison to the Church of Scientology's ban from Wikipedia to illustrate the potential for conflict of interest. User Naturalistic suggests a compromise by removing the symbols and adding a lineup of famous pantheist faces, which could be seen as an attempt to find a middle ground.

6. **Coherence and Civility**: The discussion, while heated, remains relatively civil and coherent. Both users present their arguments logically, and there is a clear structure to the conversation.

7. **Constructiveness**: User Naturalistic expresses a desire for cooperation and mutual respect, which is constructive for resolving the dispute. However, there is a sense of ongoing confrontation and edit wars, which detracts from the overall constructiveness of the discussion.

Overall, the discussion is relevant, touches on important Wikipedia policies, and shows an attempt at finding a compromise. However, there are points of contention that are not resolved within the discussion, and the tone suggests an ongoing conflict rather than a resolution. The arguments are average in quality, with both sides presenting some reasonable points but also engaging in a somewhat confrontational manner.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.",6.0

@Schneid9:  Please make available the thematic fragments and figured bass from the Mangano copy provided by Nicola Schneider. They could be uploaded to imslp.org as they are certainly in the public domain.  Then we can all judge for ourselves what was Albinoni's and what was Giazotto's in the Ricordi publication.   4:27, 12 February 2013 (UTC)

Sadly, this is not the case. What is found at that file is a typeset score, with the figured base in large notes and the melody in small notes. While it is claimed to have been made from a photostatic copy of the photograph in the Dresden library, it could just as easily have been made from Remo Giazotto's score.—

<user_id=Rdtennent>
@Jerome Kohl:  It is the case.  I typeset the transcription reproduced in Nicola Schneider's dissertation.  That dissertation is available from Dresden if you want to see it.  Whether the transcription was the source of Giazotto's composition or vice versa is indeed an open question but I certainly didn't make the score from Giazotto's.-  —Preceding undated comment added

<user_id=Jerome Kohl>
Meaning no disrespect, nor to doubt your integrity, but I cannot judge from your typeset version whether the the original appears to have been copied in a genuine 18th-century hand, whether the figuring of the bass is in a characteristic Italian manner, whether the staff lines were printed on the paper or drawn with a rastrum, or any of dozens of other features that might indicate something of the provenance of the source.  Not can I tell whether the writing is hasty, like a sketch, or careful, as might be found in a fair copy. In short, we cannot deduce anything at all about what may have been from Albinoni and what may have been from other hands, including but not limited to Giazotto. Even seeing the photocopy in the thesis would not, of course, enable any judgment about the actual age of the paper, type of ink, and other factors involved in an authentication of this source, but at least the main features of the calligraphy could be examined.—

<user_id=Rdtennent>
The relevant sections of Nicola Schneider's dissertation (translation above) make it clear that it is not an 18th century Italian transcription: ""a handwriting that appears to belong to the first half of the twentieth century. The transcriber was evidently German.""   —Preceding undated comment added

<user_id=Jerome Kohl>
In that case, without a provenance for this manuscript, it might just as well be considered a simulacrum based on Giazotto's edition.—

<user_id=Schneid9>
Nicola Schneider's Master's thesis of 2007 (written in Italian) sheds new light on the provenance of the ''Adagio''. It doesn't offer a final answer, but it shows that Giazotto did use some kind of source. The following is an edited Google translation of the relevant passage (Nicola Schneider: ''La tradizione delle opere di Tomaso Albinoni a Dresda'', tesi di laurea specialistica, Facoltà di musicologia dell'Università degli studi di Pavia, Cremona 2007, pp. 181–186; footnotes are from the original, additions by me are in small type and {curly brackets}):
{{quotation|But there is another version of the origin of the ''Adagio'', supplied by the same Giazotto, which differs considerably from that of 1958. According to the friendly communication by Remo Giazotto's last assistant and academic collaborator, Dr. Muska Mangano (Verona), the aged musicologist, near death, explained the genesis of the ''Adagio'' again, prompted by an article by Piero Buscaroli {published on 22 September 1992}. The following is Muska Mangano's letter:
According to this testimony, Giazotto received the fragments of the ''Adagio'' at the very beginning of the war without giving notice in his monograph published later.Perhaps because of scruples about the authenticity of the fragment? The discrepancy between the six and the four bars of the first violin mentioned in the versions of 1958 and 1992 respectively should certainly not be taken literally because at that time Giazotto was already very ill. Questions addressed to his heirs about the existence of material relating to his book left in their possession have not produced any results so far, therefore the allegations reported are not verifiable. But shortly before Giazotto's death, Muska Mangano undertook to finish his work on Clementi,Clementi 2002 {= Muzio Clementi: ''Epistolario 1781–1831.'' A cura di Remo Giazotto. Skira, Milan 2002}. and among his papers she found related studies and notes, including a modern photocopy of the fragment that had been the source of the ''Adagio'' in the edition of 1958. {...} The appearance of this document in Muska Mangano's possession must be considered an important fact since that copy is the only foothold of the original Dresden source.
The paper is a recent photocopy of a modern manuscript bearing in the top right-hand corner a stamp stating unequivocally the Dresden provenance of the original from which it was taken. Since, unfortunately, it is not a frame like those that constituted Giazotto's research material, namely positive images with writing in white on a black background (as seen reproduced in the monograph of 1945), it is difficult to evaluate this document. It should be noted immediately that the copy does not reproduce the basso continuo in print of which one has read many times, but its manual transcription in a handwriting that appears to belong to the first half of the twentieth century. The transcriber was evidently German – as indicated by the title {Albinoni’s Trio Sonate G moll} – and wrote down the entire figured bass, inserting the six fragmentary bars of the first violin in their place on the staves. Unfortunately, the photocopy has cut up the writing on the stamp, which thus is not decipherable, but it should be reconstructible by comparison with similar contemporary documents; the words may have contained the name either of the photo studio or of the library that is running the photograph. You can read very well the words below: “Dresden. – Lichtbild | von”. It is unclear what the doubly underlined number “7” refers to, which is located directly below the stamp; it could possibly refer to the number of bars (77 without the 'soli' in bb. 20/21), but this would be an unusual position for a number – at the top and not at the end of the piece. In any case it cannot be the beginning of a signature because in the Dresden system introduced in the years 1926–30 signatures begin with the word 'Mus.' followed by the composer's identification number (Albinoni, in this case, was given the “2199”).
Apparently, a manuscript copy of the printed source was first drawn up in Dresden, in which the melodic fragments of the first violin were then inserted, and from this manuscript the photograph was taken that came to Giazotto. From some source, however, he must have heard about the printed bass part he mentions several times. It is not clear why the Dresden library did not send a frame or a microfilm of this printed part, as they did for all the other sources. When Giazotto sold all the photographic material relating to his work on Albinoni in 1940, he could not foresee what turn the war would take. At that time, the scope of devastation the British fleet would cause in the German city shortly thereafter was unimaginable for all, which is why, perhaps, Giazotto could not calculate the value of his collection of microfilm, which preserved, at least in content, many sources that are no longer available because they burned or were dispersed.E.g. that of the concerto for violin and orchestra Co 3 held at D-Dl, Mus. 2-O-1.
Talbot and many others have “disattributed” the ''Adagio'' to Albinoni – remember that Giazotto never claimed that the piece was all original – on purely stylistic grounds. The stylistic categories to determine the authenticity of the ''Adagio'' should be applied, if anything, only to the figured bass. To facilitate a comparison of the score in Giazotto's edition, the basso continuo attested by the Dresden copy and the authentic trio sonatasThe op. I and the six sonatas So 20–25. by Albinoni, there will be a diplomatic transcription of the page of music at the end of this chapter. When he began to elaborate the figured bass, Giazotto was perhaps mindful of the example of Nikolaus Heinrich Gerber, who under the auspices of Johann Sebastian Bach had worked out an accompaniment on the figured bass of the sonata Op. VI, 6, which Spitta reprinted in the appendix to his work on Bach.Giazotto 1945, p. 84, was aware of it. A comparison of Muska Mangano's copy and the Ricordi score reveals that the bass without the figures in Giazotto's score can be found almost unchanged in the left hand of the organ. One notices slight rhythmic variations in support of the new melody and some advances designed to emphasize the essentially “romantic” character of Giazotto's piece. The original melodic fragments of the first violin are not marked as such, while many expressive and agogic indications (which at that time were not a rarity even in historical-critical editions – think of Malipiero's editorial practices) are by the modern author. The harmonic progress required by the original figures is largely respected, even if the high concentration of 9–8 suspensions, which creates a highly pathetic atmosphere, has no equivalent in the genuine trio sonatas by Albinoni.

<user_id=65.96.160.196>
Does the Dresden ""stamp"" add any plausibility to this? since it would, if true, corroborate what Giazotto had said concerning his discovery (or alleged discovery). If not, I take it you are arguing that this document would be a fabrication and part of the hoax.  Either way, thanks to @Schneid9 for finding and translating this section of Nicola Schneider's thesis.

<user_id=Schneid9>
I think we must beware of two extremes: (1) dismissing the ''Adagio'' as a pure hoax, (2) considering the Mangano discovery as solid proof of the authenticity of the fragments.
(1) Giazotto never claimed that the ''Adagio'' was all Albinonian. The original preface clearly states that it was ""composed"" by Giazotto on the basis of a printed figured bass and 6 bars of the first violin, and the cover of the Ricordi edition gives Giazotto's name in much larger print than Albinoni's. Still, the preface calls the work a ""reconstruction"", which probably suggested a greater degree of authenticity than was actually warranted, so that later editions and arrangements sometimes omitted Giazotto's name altogether (e.g. , , , , , , ). And, of course, the fact that the ''Adagio'' was often recorded together with real Albinoni works also contributed to the general impression that it was authentic (a few examples from the past: I Musici, Karl Ristenpart, Alain Boulfroy, Jean Witold; more recent ones: , , ).
(2) As R.D.Tennent said above, Nicola Schneider neither claims nor believes that the sheet of music discovered by Muska Mangano among Giazotto's papers is an 18th century manuscript or even an Albinoni autograph. Instead, he places it in the first half of the 20th century (because of the handwriting) and in Germany (because of the German title ""Albinoni's, Trio Sonate G. moll"" and the fragmentary stamp ""Dresden. Lichtbild von""  [= Dresden. Photograph by]). If this interpretation is correct (and I see no reason why it shouldn't, except perhaps for the rather awkward spelling of the title – ""Albinonis Triosonate G-Moll"" would have been more normal), it might be defensible to conclude that Giazotto did base his ''Adagio'' on a source, though we still don't know (a) who wrote the manuscript, (b) if the manuscript was held by a Dresden library or if it was only photographed in Dresden (the Saxon State Library may well have been right in their denial that the manuscript had ever been in their possession!), (c) if Albinoni was the composer. What I don't believe is that the manuscript was based on Giazotto's score: The only person who would have had a reason to do so was Giazotto himself (because he was constantly bothered about his source), so if he really made such a masterful forgery (including the idiosyncratic stamp!), why didn't he produce it during his lifetime? Or does anybody think his assistant Muska Mangano made it to restore Giazotto's good reputation? Then why did she give it to a student of music for his unpublished Master's thesis instead of making it available to the general public?

<user_id=Schneid9>
All things considered, I would suggest that (1) the POV expression ""hoax"" should be removed from the article and (2) the passage about the Mangano fragment should be worded more carefully: The discovery of the fragment doesn't really indicate ""that Albinoni was his source"" but only that a source seems to have existed.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The discussion begins with a request from Rdtennent to make available the thematic fragments and figured bass from the Mangano copy, which is believed to be in the public domain. This request is based on the desire for transparency and the ability for the public to assess the authenticity of the Albinoni-Giazotto Adagio.

2. User 109.41.10.71 responds by indicating that this has been done, but Jerome Kohl counters that the typeset score available does not provide enough information to assess the provenance of the source, which is a valid concern when dealing with historical documents and authenticity.

3. Rdtennent clarifies that they typeset the transcription from Nicola Schneider's dissertation and raises the question of whether the transcription was the source of Giazotto's composition or vice versa. This adds to the discussion by providing a source for the typeset score and further questioning the relationship between the transcription and Giazotto's work.

4. Jerome Kohl expresses skepticism about the ability to judge the original manuscript's characteristics from the typeset version, which is a reasonable point when considering the importance of physical characteristics in historical document authentication.

5. Rdtennent provides information from Nicola Schneider's dissertation that suggests the transcription is not an 18th-century Italian manuscript but rather appears to be from the first half of the 20th century and likely German. This is a significant contribution to the discussion as it provides context and potential origin for the manuscript in question.

6. Jerome Kohl suggests that without provenance, the manuscript might be considered a simulacrum based on Giazotto's edition, which is a cautious approach to the authenticity of the document.

7. Schneid9 provides a detailed account from Nicola Schneider's thesis, which adds depth to the discussion by presenting new information about the provenance of the Adagio and the involvement of Giazotto. This is a substantial contribution as it provides a more nuanced view of the situation.

8. User 65.96.160.196 asks about the plausibility added by the Dresden stamp, which is a relevant question as it pertains to the credibility of the document's origin.

9. Schneid9 warns against two extremes: dismissing the Adagio as a hoax or considering the Mangano discovery as solid proof. This balanced view is important for maintaining objectivity in the discussion.

10. Schneid9 suggests changes to the Wikipedia article to reflect a more nuanced understanding of the situation, which is a constructive approach to resolving the controversy.

Overall, the discussion is characterized by a thoughtful exchange of ideas, careful consideration of historical authenticity, and a willingness to delve into detailed research to inform the debate. The participants use logical reasoning and provide evidence to support their points, which contributes to a high-quality discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 9.",9.0

POV issues

<user_id=Eladynnus>
I've been reading this and other articles relating to the Serer, and the feeling I get is that the information here is being presented to us in a way that suggests that Serer culture is or was far more sophisticated than it actually is. On this page in particular there are several references to and a gallery of pictographs which are apparently indigenous, but the only reference is to phonecia.org, which does not appear to be reliable. Searches on Google and JSTOR turned up nothing. I think that some kind of task force composed of French speakers (not including Tamsier, who has written virtually everything about the Serer on Wikipedia and has an attachment to these articles) investigate the content and tone of it all.

<user_id=Drmies>
The claim that the French wiki is superior to the English wiki is silly enough, but that this would have something to do with the French nationality is laughable. You're claiming systemic bias in the same breath with which you proclaim that one nationality is superior to another one. As for this article and this tag, I happen to agree with the removal (though your edit summary is, as usual, insulting): I don't see how for instance the images in the article skew its neutrality.

<user_id=Eladynnus>
I could understand if there was little attestation of Raampa on the internet. However, there is none except for the phoenicia.org citation, which itself does not seem to be a trustworthy source (I haven't seen it in citations about any other Phoenician topics) and which makes some very dubious claims about Linear A. I will find the appropriate tag and use it shortly.

<user_id=Eladynnus>
Tamsier, I am somewhat offended by your suggestion that I am automatically biased simply because I speak English and edit pages on the English Wikipedia. I believe that this and related articles suffer from, among other things, an extreme lack of concision and oversight (for example, you are literally the only editor of the Serer topics template and are the author of all the content in many others, which you have marked as top-importance on the Gambian and Senegalese wikiprojects). I have also noticed that you are quick to remove tags which might cast an article's quality or objectivity into doubt. Taken as a whole, this situation smacks of impropriety and it is because of this that I added the tag and suggested that a group of French speaking Wikipedians examine these articles. Please bear in mind that just being aware of systemic bias does not free one from it; this is just as true for you as it is for me.

<user_id=Tamsier>
Hello Eladynnus, I was going to send you a longer reply with diffs but I had a crash so I will make it as short as I can. Not short enough but there you go. Most Serer articles I have created have their corresponding French article which have been gone through by experienced French editor (who are more tougher than English). You are more than welcome to go through my French userpage and all the articles I have listed there and you will find that I have actually invited them to go through them and they have done so (see their edit history). The Raampa thing that you are going on about is actually the work of the anthropologist Moranz because it was available on the net, I thought I made a link to it, but I could have easily cited many scholarly works including those of BIFAN, Gravrand's - ""Le Symbolisme sereer  Mythe du Saas et symboles"" , etc. The Raampa are Serer religious symbols. Raampa itself is not English, not French, not even Serer-Sine language but a Saafi word from the Cangin group who are ethically Serers. You seem to come here assuming a lot of bad faith but even worst passing judgement on a culture you surely know nothing about. Serer ultra traditionalists care less about Linear A or anything of a sort. The Serer traditionalists are proud of their Black African herigage. They do not look to Egypt, they do not look to Rome or to Arabia via Islam to feel validated. I think you are mistaken the Serer traditionalist with other ethnic groups or other people from other parts of the world. I have never ever met a Serer traditionalist who looks to Egypt or anywhere else. The Serers are proud Serers (Black Africans) not Egyptians or Carthagians, so please don't panic. The Raampa pictographs are religious pictographs rooted in Serer symbolism.  In French Wiki, the Raampa was actually cleaned up and arranged properly after going through the source by an experience French editor from the Saafi article I previously added it in , and here I am giving her credit as I add  it back to the Serer religion article . French Wiki is tougher than English. Unsubstantiate claims or rubbish will be deleted if not tagged as needing citation. As you can see in one of the sentences in Saafi's lead where the editor added a citation needed tag and in her edit summary she says  ""sources for the Gambia not found"" . Not everything is in google at a click of a mouse or that sources only have to be in English. I suggest you read Wiki sourcing policy. You cannot hold Wikipedia or Serer, Senegambian or any article to ransom by hoping that someone who speaks French will pop-up and do your work for you. I have heard it all before but I have never heard that one in all the time I have been on Wiki. ) With respect, and no offense meant, it is not my problem if you cannot read French. The French language is not my mother togue eiter, but I have to learn it and still learning it (not perfect but ok) so do the same. Now I asked you a question, do you have other reliable sources that substantiate your claim? Or is this just one of those drive-by-tagging and Spider-Man episodes? So that you know, I do not own these  articles. If you find other ways to improve the article with reliable sources, by all means be bold and just do it. Go ahead and improve it. It saves you and me and every body else time. But you cannot hold articles to ransom. I have never head of that.

<user_id=Eladynnus>
Tamsier, what happens at the French Wikipedia is not relevant to this conversation and your repeated assertion that what we produce here is untrustworthy and inferior is not constructive. In addition, your comments about what ""ultra traditionalists"" think about Raampa suggests that you don't even believe the article you cited is true! You cannot just ignore the parts of a citation that you disagree with. It is for this reason, and the reasons I discussed above, that I feel some kind of oversight is needed.

<user_id=Tamsier>
I am not going to edit war with you over a tag, frankly I do not have the time or patience. I hate edit wars and find them rather distructive to the project. I asked you for sources but you have provided nothing. I am also finding it rather difficult to understand your last comment. It is not making sense like the former. You also came here hoping some French speaking editor would come and do the work for you. You formerly placed the same tag and I removed it even another editor says that your tag was unjustified. Yet, you went and placed the same tag again. My advise is that you read the neutrality policy and Wiki policies in general before placing tags. I have couple of issues for you which you may be able to help me with. You placed the tag on the top which indicates you doubt the neutrality of the whole article or a major part of it. Question  what are you going to do to improve the article? Tagging is the last resort and you have to do something to make it better rather than just tagging. Considering I have told you to be bold and improve the article with RS, you have done nothing so far, you did not even leave an edit summary on your first tag. Since you have an opinion about this article, I would like to know how you are going to improve it? Or must we all be patient and wait until Eladynnus can find a French speaker? No offense, but do you know how ridiculous that sounds? At present, you have done no edit to the article other than trying to force your view on the talk page and plastering tags on the article. Why don't you just be bold and improve it since you clearly have an opinion about this religion? I am not stopping you. I don't own this article or any article on Wiki. If you have ways to improve the article or the project, then by all means just go ahead and do it rather than being disruptive and placing unjustifiable tags just because you can and it is the easiest thing to do. Oh wait! Don't tell me you have never edited an article before? I give you one day and if I do not see any attempt from you to improve the article (the ""things"" that you take issue with) and remove the tag, I will remove the tag myself. And if you replace the tag I will report you. This project does not need drive-by-taggers.

<user_id=Eladynnus>
I am very busy today and don't really have time to explain myself, but I ask you to refer to WP:TIND. I am not a drive-by tagger and you are not in a place to issue ultimatums or reverse edits simply because you disagree with me. Also, contributing to Wikipedia means more than just editing an article - I am drawing attention to what I perceive to be POV and quality issues.

<user_id=Tamsier>
If you believe there is a POV or quality issue, then go ahead and fix it. I have told you that many times. If I see an unref article for instance, I add refs. If I see an error, I fix it. Sure, all articles can be improved but you have made no attempts to improve the article other than placing inappropriate tags to it just because you can. I am not going to waste my time having these meaningless ""discussions"" with you. I have neither the time nor the inclination. You have a day.

<user_id=Tamsier>
Someone has just placed this article under speedy deletion (an IP user). Somehow, this has never ever happened to this article before until you've showed up and started placing tags. All the editors who contributed to this article so far have tried to improve it in one way or the other, even the ones I have had disagreements with have always provided proposals. What just happened has never happened to this article before until you showed up. Very strange. I've removed the speedy deletion template. I have been assuming lots of good faith but vandalising Wiki articles is not a nice thing to do. I 've also removed your tags. If you are really interested in improving the article (since you have an opinion about it) go ahead and improve. You do not need to tag it. I will be filing a report if this continues.

<user_id=Eladynnus>
Please call this to the administrators' attention, I've been saying for days now that that is needed. Tags are not vandalism (except maybe deletion tags placed on an article by a never-before-seen IP editor - good thing you were there to undo it a few minutes later!), and it is improper to remove tags as quickly as you do in these Serer articles, and especially without saying so in your edit summary as you did in this most recent edit here, instead only saying that you have reverted vandalism.

<user_id=Tamsier>
Although I could have been more detailed in my edit summary (I give you that), I did so in my edit summary and made reference to here . What I find strange is that, this has never ever happened before. Inspite of all the previous disagreements, which were finally all settled amicably by all the major previous editors on this article, such a thing has never ever happened before until now. I have great respect for many of those former editors including Halaqah (who in the end we finally made our peace and got on). I have also expressed my respect for Halaqah on their talk page and elsewhere in spite of all the previous disagreements. I am sure if he was here he would be just as disappointed at just what happened. This has never ever happened before until now. Very strange. Looking at the IPs contribution, it looks like it was specifically directed to this article because I could find no contribution log as of todate where they have ""contributed"" to another article apart from this one IP 70.94.83.11 @ on Serer religion. I have looked into Whois and here are the IP's details. I think admin would be able to do a comparison analysis to find out which computer it came from and whether a registered editor also uses that computer.

Evaluation of Discussion Quality:

- The discussion shows a clear conflict between the desire for neutrality and the defense of existing content.
- Eladynnus is persistent in expressing concerns about neutrality and source reliability but does not provide alternative sources or specific edits to address the issues.
- Tamsier defends the content robustly, citing other scholarly works and the review process on the French Wikipedia, but becomes confrontational and sets ultimatums rather than addressing the concerns in a collaborative manner.
- The discussion becomes less about the content and more about the behavior of tagging and removing tags, which detracts from the substantive issue of article quality and neutrality.
- There is a lack of collaborative problem-solving and an escalation of tensions, which reduces the overall quality of the discussion.

Incorrect and inappropriate photo

<user_id=Ogwikitem>
I am new to wikipedia so please bear with me if this is not the correct place to discuss this. I appear the a photo towards the bottom of this article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lady_Thatcher_at_dinner_2008_crop.jpg) and I would really like the photo to be removed or replaced by another. First, the caption reads ""Thatcher surrounded by Young Conservatives"" and I am not and have never been a Conservative. I was actually at the event to help out my friend's parents and didn't realise it was a Conservative event prior to turning up. Second, I am actually looking for a job in progressive politics and this may really impede my efforts. Third, I never consented to my photo being used in this way. I realise that you cannot totally manage the way that your image is used on the internet but I would really like this to be rectified. The photo does not actually add any great substance to the article so perhaps a different photo from the same Author could be used instead. I checked and there are some that are just as good. I would obviously change it myself if I could but the article is semi-protected.

<user_id=Ogwikitem>
Can someone please advise me about the best way to proceed?

<user_id=Malleus Fatuorum>
So you were wearing a Wandsworth Conservatives sash, but you didn't realise that it was a Conservative event? What the fuck did you think it was?

<user_id=Ogwikitem>
I actually said I didn't realise until I arrived, and once I was there it would have been pretty rude and petulant to leave. I obviously wouldn't put myself in that situation now and couldn't have foreseen that it would end up on Thatcher's wikipedia page. Anyway, the information is wrong and I presume it should be rectified. Like I said, I'm new to wikipedia so I'd just like to see what can be done about it.

<user_id=Malleus Fatuorum>
So having realised what the event was, why did you don a Wandsworth Conservatives sash and allow yourself to be photographed with Margaret Thatcher? In what way is the information wrong? Were you not there? Were you not wearing that sash?

<user_id=BritishWatcher>
You could try raising this matter on the picture talkpage here. However i am unsure if there is anything that can be done, had you been a conservative and changed your mind and now become a liberal, the image would still be accurate. The fact that the sash says conservatives does back up the description. However the description of the picture on this article could be changed to the description of the photo on its file page which is ""Lady Thatcher at a conservative dinner in London, UK.""   The picture certainly does not need to be removed, but depending on how others feel the rewording to be in line with the original description the image was uploaded with might be a compromise. But im certainly not convinced the change is needed,

<user_id=Ogwikitem>
OK, so I suppose the series of events are quite implausible, and I could just be lying about the ""not being a Conservative"" thing. The whole situation was pretty awkward and with hindsight I should have acted differently. But I was young and didn't want to be rude or rock the boat. However, the caption makes a factual claim about Thatcher being surrounded by young Conservatives. Now, being a Young Conservative requires membership and I'm sure that the fact I was not a young Conservative can be verified by checking some records. That would be much more accurate than inferring from the photo, especially given that I am now saying that I was (and am) not. Like I said, I'm not clued up on how these things work and I wanted to check on here to see what, if anything, can be done. I'm happy to compromise and I really don't wan't annoy anyone.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

<user_id=BritishWatcher>
I have changed the caption to reflect the description of the image when it was initially uploaded. So it now is more accurate and does not state that everyone in the image is a conservative. With the caption now changed, im not entirely sure what else can be done. I see no justification for removing the picture all together. However it might be worth asking at Wikipedia:Help desk on if there is a way for you to request the image be deleted due to you being in it. But apart from that, i dont know what else to suggest.

<user_id=Malleus Fatuorum>

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The initial concern raised by <user_id=Ogwikitem> is legitimate and is presented in a polite and reasonable manner. The user is concerned about being misrepresented in a photo on Wikipedia and explains the potential personal consequences of this misrepresentation.

2. <user_id=Malleus Fatuorum> responds with skepticism and a confrontational tone, questioning the user's account of the events and using inappropriate language. This response does not contribute constructively to the discussion and lowers the overall quality of the argument.

3. <user_id=BritishWatcher> provides a more constructive response, suggesting a possible compromise by changing the caption to better reflect the situation and directing the user to the help desk for further assistance. This is a helpful and relevant contribution to the discussion.

4. <user_id=Ogwikitem> acknowledges the implausibility of their situation but reiterates the factual inaccuracy of the caption and expresses a willingness to compromise. This shows a continued effort to resolve the issue in a civil manner.

5. <user_id=BritishWatcher> follows up with an action that addresses the concern by changing the caption, which is a positive step towards resolution. However, they also express doubt about the need for further changes, which may not fully address the user's concerns.

6. <user_id=Malleus Fatuorum> makes another unconstructive comment that does not contribute to resolving the issue and includes an insult directed at another user.

7. <user_id=Caesar's Daddy> and <user_id=Skyring> call for civility, which is important for maintaining a respectful and productive discussion environment, but their comments do not directly address the original concern.

Overall, the discussion includes a mix of constructive suggestions, factual considerations, and unproductive, confrontational remarks. The quality of the arguments varies, with some users attempting to address the issue at hand and others detracting from the discussion with incivility.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

The Greatest?

<user_id=189.104.125.79>
Hello, I'd like to know why Maradona's article is the only for a footballer that states that he is the greatest footballer of all time. Pelé, Beckenbauer, Cruijff, Garrincha, none of theses player's articles says that. Thank you.

<user_id=Kevin McE>
The first response is that it doesn't say that.  It says that some people have described him as such, and then has a vast number of citations to prove that the statement is true.
The other reason is that each article attracts the attention of different editors, and different editors will choose to phrase and construct articles differently.  Don't expect formulaic consistency across Wikipedia.

<user_id=201.50.41.96>
So if someone wants to edit Pelé's article the same way (and, believe me, a lot more people say he was the best, there are even more sources), noone will revert it?

<user_id=201.50.41.96>
And I don't expect ""formulaic consistency"", I expect impartiality.

Citations about polls, and votes of players and experts should not be deleted.
These references should not be deleted from the page.

Considering the whole number of different sources the phrase: ''Many experts, football critics, former players, current players and football fans in general consider Maradona as one of the greatest football players of all time.'' is quite accurate.   —Preceding undated comment added

<user_id=Lsw10>
Kevin McE, Wikipedia states: ''Editing from a neutral point of view (NPOV) means representing fairly, proportionately, and as far as possible without bias, all significant views that have been published by reliable sources.'' '''All significant views'''. That was what my references were about. Editors here only include the FIFA internet poll, the only major poll which Maradona won, and omit prestigious Ballon D'Or, IFFHS, and the most respected football magazines and experts, among them Guerin Sportivo, and World Soccer magazine. Votes from the 30 Ballon D'Or winners in 1999, from the International Federation of Football History and Statistics, and from internet polls from Marca(over 85000 voters) and Goal com '''are''' significant and should not be removed or omited.   —Preceding undated comment added

<user_id=Lsw10>
Kevin McE,Your reasoning is not sensible at all. Many players have people regarding them as the best ever, that does not mean that their Wikipedia page justifies the description: Regarded by many as the best in history.

<user_id=Kevin McE>
Why did you post that precise claim at an article then?

<user_id=Lsw10>
The amount of sources supporting that claim in that article justify that description, which was actually not first written by me. I started by just adding further references. Many people have chenged the text content through the years of the article. You are the one who deletes references and leaves the Maradona article much more poorly sourced than I do. Any player can just have a couple of references stating he is the best of all time. It is still a bit misleading. I explained about the value of the Ballon D'Or, and the IFFHS votes. Omiting them indicates a biased point of view.

<user_id=Lsw10>
With this logic any player who receives a few votes in the Yearly FIFA Ballon D'Or vote, or in fans poll, can justify a comment in his Wikipedia page as something like this: ''...x player is considered by many as the current best player in the world.'' Players like Iniesta, Xavi, Neymar, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic, Falcao could all have that description and with justification, since there are quite a few who believe that they are the best in the world today.

<user_id=Kevin McE>
16 refs is plenty. Your intentions here are clear, and unencyclopaedic.

<user_id=Kevin McE>
Re your ballon d'Or comments, such temporary comments are clearly inappropriate if undated, but are you suggesting that it would be inaccurate to say that many respected commentators considered any of those to be the best player of the early 2010s?  You would clearly be in error to oppose such a statement.

<user_id=Lsw10>
No, they just three references on the top of the page. Unless you regard as serious references in players like widely unknown scot FRANK McGARVEY and biased Argentines Mario Kempes, Lionel Messi and Maradona's son in law Sergio Aguero! Like I said earlier, then you are the one who should show consistency and edit many players pages who also have claims as the best in the world or the best ever.

<user_id=Lsw10>
Quoting another user, Cambalachero, deleting sources is VANDALISM. ""It was mere vandalism, it was undone. Thanks for your contributions Cambalachero (talk) UTC"". Look below at the ""Vote"" section. No, it would not be inappropriate if it was that specific as you describe now. Naming person. But not generalizing taking advantage of a few quotes. Do not delete references, it is considered vandalism.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The initial concern raised by the first user is about the impartiality of Wikipedia articles, specifically regarding the claim that Maradona is the greatest footballer of all time. The user compares Maradona's article to those of other football legends and questions why only Maradona's article contains such a statement.

2. Kevin McE responds by clarifying that the article does not outright state Maradona is the greatest but rather that some people have described him as such. He also mentions that different editors contribute to articles differently, which can lead to inconsistencies.

3. The user with the IP address 201.50.41.96 questions whether similar edits to Pelé's article would be accepted and expresses a desire for impartiality across Wikipedia articles.

4. Lsw10 argues for the inclusion of citations about polls, votes, and opinions from various sources that support the claim of Maradona being one of the greatest. This user emphasizes the importance of representing all significant views published by reliable sources.

5. Kevin McE challenges the reasoning behind adding such a claim to any article and questions the justification for doing so.

6. Lsw10 defends the inclusion of references by highlighting the number of sources that support the claim and criticizes the selective omission of prestigious awards and polls that could support similar claims for other players.

7. Lsw10 also points out that if the logic of including a few references to support a claim were applied consistently, many current players could be described as the best in the world on their Wikipedia pages.

8. Kevin McE asserts that the number of references currently in the Maradona article is sufficient and implies that Lsw10's intentions are not in line with encyclopedic standards.

9. Lsw10 counters by questioning the quality and bias of some of the references and calls for consistency in editing across different players' pages.

10. Lsw10 cites another user's comment that deleting sources is considered vandalism and argues for the inclusion of references without generalizing based on a few quotes.

Evaluation:
- The discussion involves a debate over the neutrality and consistency of Wikipedia articles, which is a valid concern for an encyclopedia.
- Both parties present arguments with some merit: the need for neutrality and the inclusion of significant views supported by reliable sources.
- The dialogue, however, becomes somewhat circular, with both sides repeating their points without reaching a consensus or compromise.
- There is a lack of constructive resolution or a clear path forward to address the concerns raised.
- The discussion could benefit from a more collaborative approach and a focus on Wikipedia's guidelines and policies to determine the best course of action.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5. The discussion has some valid points and shows engagement with the topic, but it lacks constructive progress and resolution.",5.5
"<user_id=Scott MacDonald>
Original research

<user_id=Scott MacDonald>
Does any reliable source say this is a global term, or has significant use outside North America? Otherwise what we have here is original research based on Wikipedians finding the term in one or two sources. That's unacceptable.
It has been documented is also weasel wording. By whom? Has a study been done? Or is it simply that wikipedians have found a few usages and drawn a conclusion from their own research? Has any reliable sources documented the various international usages and drawn an independent conclusion that we can record?

<user_id=Telemachus.forward>
Scott, on the Category deletion discussion page (for this topic) you have been presented with a list of ""military brat"" organizations (using that exact term) from several different countries, including New Zealand, the Philippines, Canada, Britain, Australia, America and India.
That alone shows the term to be in use in all of these countries^^.

<user_id=Telemachus.forward>
So you shouldn't comment on something unless you read what has been presented to you thoroughly.
Also, please do not make personal attacks, by using the term ""Weasel words"", when debating Wikipedia editing issues.

<user_id=Scott MacDonald>
Nonsense. First, I made no personal attacks. I commented on the wording - see WP:WEASEL. Second, pointing to a source here and a source there and drawing a conclusion none of the sources individually support is the nature of original research. Please don't personalise this. If no source suggests this is an ""international term"" then Wikipedia must not do that either. I have read what has been presented, and it is not adequate under our policy.

<user_id=Telemachus.forward>
Actually, you haven't read this as thoroughly as you think.
Over there (and here) are cited articles describing ""Canadian military brats as an institution"", Indian military brats as having ""a different way of life"", academic citations citing the British use of of the term (""British Regiment Attached Traveler"") and a Wikipedia article citing the use of the term ""Brat""
in (In Britain, associated with the RAF) in relation to this subject as far back as 1922. Also cited are books that focus on the subject of ""military brats"" in American culture.
This is all'' in addition'' to the fraternal organizations in numerous countries that I have mentioned above.

<user_id=Telemachus.forward>
Also I'd like to mention a common mistake that many people make in failing to understand ""military brat"" cultures: They will think about children of veterans that they know (and their lives) and assume they have the whole story.
Second, most ""military brats"" are children of''' career''' military families who serve for 20, 30 even 40 years. So (in terms of the '''""subcultural""''' use of the term) they are '''not''' the children of ""Joe"" or ""Michael"" down the street who only served in the military for 4 years. They are the children of '''career''' military families who grew up totally immersed in the culture and rituals of the military in a way that many civilians do not understand.

<user_id=Scott MacDonald>
That's what I thought. The answer to my question is ""no"".

<user_id=Telemachus.forward>
That's your opinion. There are plenty more sources available as well, academic sources, news articles, literature, electronic media, government studies

<user_id=Balloonman>
That's right... if we disregard international organizations that use the term, international news papers/news media that use the term, international scholars that have used the term, etc then you are entirely correct.  But only after we disregard the numerous sources that do use it.  Give me a break.-'''''' ''''

<user_id=Scott MacDonald>
Sorry, Balloonman no. I do not believe this is an international term, I suspect it is a US term that has (like other bits of US culture) been occasionally transmitted into other spheres. If you want to say it is an international term, you will need to provide a source to support that. Pointing to occasional uses, and inviting a conclusion, does not support that. Indeed it is the essence of a synthesis towards original research. It is, of course, entirely possible that I am wrong and that this is an international term, but so far I've seen no source to support that assertion, and for myself I find it somewhat unlikely. However, my opinion is not relevant - nor is any inference you or I may or may not draw from such usage as we might find, since we are not doing research. So, is there a source saying that this is an international term? I will keep pressing that question.

<user_id=Scott MacDonald>
My opinion, or my interpretation of some sourced instances, is irrelevant - as is yours. We are not doing research. Is there a source saying this is an international term?

<user_id=Telemachus.forward>
When there are acceptable sources for referencing the use of the term in several countries then yes, that is proof of International use of the term.

<user_id=Scott MacDonald>
No it's not. It's proof that it as been used on those few occasions, that's all. It does not prove that it is an international term at all.

<user_id=Balloonman>
But therein lies the point though Scott.  You have tens of thousands of people from England, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Canada joining various face book groups dedicated to Brats.  You have several organizations from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc that date back to the 1990's that use the term brat in reference to children of military personell.  You have various media outlets and (especially in the case of Canada) governmental agencies using the term to reference brats.  You have international scholars (albeit not many) who use the term.  The very existence of The Australian and New Zealand Brats of Singapore which has been in existence since 2001 and had annual reunions since 2003 shows that this term is international.  As does the Canadian Air Force Brat Association which started its website in 1996 and claims over 10K members.  You have similar terms (pad brats and scale-e brats) that have no American antecendent, but are used elsewhere to describe military brats.

<user_id=Balloonman>
The existence of the term and usage around the globe can't be disputed; it is fact and easily discernable.  You do not need a source that says, ""This term is used internationally"" when you can show sources that prove it.  Frankly what you are asking for is absurd and not necessary.  What you are saying is, ""I need a source that says, 'military brat is a term used in canada.'""  When provided with multiple sources showing that the term is used in Canada, you are saying, ""No no, the fact that the term is used in Canada isn't enough, I need a source that says it is used.""  That's ridiculous.-'''''' ''''

<user_id=Scott MacDonald>
You have demonstrated that an American slang term is occasionally used in other contexts. Congratulations, that is true of most American slang terms. To draw an inference from that is original research. We don't ""demonstrate"" hypotheses in Wikipedia - no matter how obvious they may seem to you. We document what the sources say. No more, no less.

<user_id=Balloonman>
No, I have shown that it is used internationally and has been for at least 10-15 years, and even if originally a US slang, it has been co-opted on an international level.  I've also posed a question, if the term ""brat"" were used exclusively by the US to reference military brats, please explain the terms ""Scaley/scalie/scale-e brat"" and ""PAD Brat""?  Those terms are used by the children of British military personell and have no US antecedent.-'''''' ''''

<user_id=Scott MacDonald>
You've presented a case, yes. That case may well be be correct. And your research in presenting that case is obviously extensive. My question is: ss this research original, or has someone else done this documentation and reached this conclusion first? If it isn't original then there's isn't a problem.

<user_id=Balloonman>
It's not a ""case"", it's the way things are.  We don't need to cite every sentence, only those that are questionable/dubious.  Those that are plainly discernable/provable, don't have to have individual citations.  I don't know how long (or widespread) the term has been used in England/Canada/New Zealand/India/Australia, but it is incontrovertable that the term is used internationally and has crept into their lexicons.  It is also incontrovertable that at least two derviations (pad and scale-e brat) have no US antecedent.  Now if I were to argue that the terms scalee and pad brats were more common in the 1960s'/70's, then yes that would be original research.  And yes, based on what I've seen, I suspect that to be the case (people who use the terms appear to be older).  The international usage of the term, however, is merely acknowledging the fact that brat is used in other countries to denote children of military service members-it is easily discernable and verifiable.  No ""research"" is required.

<user_id=Balloonman>
I am interested in seeing how this article evolves... as I have not seen enough reliable sources to merit writing a full article on the concept of military brats outside of the US that would not involve Original Research.  (But I haven't really looked since I worked on the US subculture one.)  Using Wertsch/Ender's books to talk about military brats in foreign countries is dubious at best (those were dealing with US brats and in Wersch's case Cold War era brats)-some countries don't move around as much, some countries the military member moves around while the family stays put, others don't go off to war as much, for others it is a constant state of life.  I never felt like I could write a comprehensive article/definition that adequately answered those variances in military life.-'''''' ''''

<user_id=Telemachus.forward>
I think those are all great points. And I agree that the case for International use of the term is overwhelming.
I also think Balloonman is absolutely right that there is a variance of ""mobility"" in the lifestyle from country to country. The article might benefit from detailing (with sources) some of those variances, as well as highlighting commonalities.
I'm still pretty busy today but I'll say briefly that I have been able to dig out information on mobility among military brats (also called ""Fauji brats"" in India) The mobile lifestyle is internal to India, but still cross-regional and given India's diversity, cross-cultural in nature). Perhaps this is due to British influence, since British military brats have been very mobile, especially were so during the time of the British Empire (up to the 1940s) and the Indian military was previously a part of the British empire.
Canada, Britain, New Zealand and Australia also have degrees of mobility in the lifestyle. I don't know about the Philippines. Or Pakistan.
There are now two Filipino military brat subcultures, one has assimilated into the US military, (is multi-generational) and there is academic writing about it.
There is also a subculture of current children of the Philippine military.
I can totally understand how one could spend huge amounts of time on American military brats alone, there is a lot there to spend time on.

<user_id=Balloonman>
Oh yeah, Scott, I would consider it original research if this were based solely upon blogs/individual websites, but the fact that it has been used by major media sources and researchers elsewhere speaks to the usage.  The fact that it has attracted not just a few hundred followers on websites, but that the India/Canada/British brat facebook groups have attracted thousands of followers speaks to its usage.  If all of the facebook groups for India/Canada/Britian showed a few hundred followers and the US cite numbered in thousands, then that would say something.  The fact that tens of thousands of non-US brats have joined various groups does say something about the usage outside of the US.-'''''' ''''

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Original Research Concern**: Scott MacDonald raises a concern about original research, which is a valid point in the context of Wikipedia's guidelines. Wikipedia requires that content be verifiable and not based on original research. His insistence on reliable sources to support the claim that ""military brat"" is an international term is in line with Wikipedia's policies.

2. **Evidence of International Use**: Telemachus.forward and Balloonman provide evidence of the term's use in various countries, citing organizations, academic citations, and media usage. This is a strong argument that the term does have some international usage.

3. **Weasel Words and Personal Attacks**: Scott MacDonald points out the use of ""weasel words"" and clarifies that he is not making personal attacks but critiquing the wording. This is a relevant point in maintaining the objectivity and neutrality of Wikipedia content.

4. **Understanding of Subculture**: Telemachus.forward explains the difference between children of short-term military personnel and those of career military families, which is an important distinction in understanding the term's subcultural context. This adds depth to the discussion.

5. **Synthesis of Information**: Scott MacDonald argues that pointing to individual instances of usage does not necessarily prove that the term is internationally recognized. This is a valid point in terms of avoiding synthesis of original research.

6. **Existence of International Organizations**: Balloonman argues that the existence of international organizations and the use of the term by media and scholars is sufficient to demonstrate international usage. This is a strong argument for the term's international presence.

7. **Requirement for a Direct Source**: Scott MacDonald's insistence on a direct source stating the term is international is a stringent requirement that may not always be necessary if the usage is widespread and can be demonstrated through multiple independent instances.

8. **Derivative Terms**: Balloonman's mention of derivative terms like ""pad brat"" and ""scale-e brat"" suggests that the concept of military brats has been adapted and used in other cultures, which supports the argument for international usage.

Overall, the discussion shows a good understanding of Wikipedia's policies, a clear presentation of evidence, and a debate on the interpretation of that evidence. Both sides present valid points, and the discussion remains civil and focused on the topic at hand. The arguments are generally coherent, relevant, and show factual accuracy, although there is a disagreement on the interpretation of Wikipedia's guidelines regarding original research and the synthesis of information.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

The info-box should have an Establishment/Formation section, not merely an 'Independence' section.
The British occupation and end thereof are a miniscule portion of the history of India. 'Independence' from the British and Islamic occupations are signposts not beginnings or ends in themselves.
India as an entity has been in existence for thousands of years. It seems silly for this page to subscribe to the nonsensical notion that India is a recent construct or that it came into existence at the end of the British occupation.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

This article is about the modern country of India and as such didnt exist before 1947.

<user_id=114.143.116.232>
If it is about the 'modern country of India' then why is there a History section that mentions 'Ancient India' and 'Medieval India'? By your logic there shouldn't be a single shred of information about anything that happened before the end of the British occupation. Governing systems, dispensations and even geography may change but the page is about the cultural and geographic entity that has been known as India for millennia. [Side note: I find it amusing that an Englishman is the presiding judge deciding on matters concerning the India page.]  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=114.143.116.232>
Also, if this page is solely about the 'Republic of India' then there cannot logically be a mention of 'independence', because it was not the present republic that gained said independence. If we are confining ourselves to the republic then surely we must state that it came into being (once again we must use the word formation) on August 15th 1947. Sticking to the logic of this page the entity that gained independence was not the current republic but that thing which preceded it.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

<user_id=MilborneOne>
Nothing wrong with having information about the history before independence to put everything in context. But the present ""India"" in this article didnt exist before 1947 which was larger and different hence the information to put it all in context.

<user_id=114.143.116.232>
Was the People's Republic of China established in 221 BCE? Was the current Federal Republic of Germany formed in 962 CE?  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

Like I said earlier geography and dispensations may vary but the entity in question remains unchanged. The present 'Germany' in the article on that country didn't exist in 962 did it? The India before 1947 may have been larger or smaller but it wasn't different and that is the point. This is clearly a serious matter that calls for a serious discussion and a re-think on the very nature of the India page. I think we need some higher level people involved here.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

Higher level? I think you will find eveybody is at the same level. And please dont make comments about other editors it doesnt help. Not sure why you think it is serious we have a large number of articles on the history of india and this one is about the current country called ""India"" it has sibling articles about other bits of what was also called India like the British Raj. Nobody is saying that the Republic of India doesnt share a common path back in time with other bits of the Indian subcontinent but this article is about the Union and the Republic of India. You are welcome to make a formal proposal for others to comment but you need to define exactly what you want to add to the infobox.

<user_id=114.143.116.232>
I wasn't threatening to go over your head on anything. I just meant if this is a change that you are not authorized to perform then a higher-level editor might be called for. I would like more people joining in on this that is all. As for making myself clearer on what I want, I would request you to peruse some of the other country pages, the China and Germany ones that I mentioned for instance. It is simple fact that the 'current' Germany was not formed in 962 CE but that is what the infobox says. It is simple fact that the current China was not formed in 221 BCE but that is what the infobox says. I am sure those countries also have separate 'History of' pages - that is not the issue at hand. The point is that India, China, Germany, Russia (formed in 862 apparently) have all been in existence in one form or another for eons. The current form of these countries is just that, the current form, of entites, be they geographic, cultural, and/or ethnic that go back a long way. What a country page should do is form a thread backwards starting with the current entity, It should not regard the current entity as a standalone. Moreover what I am calling for is uniformity and the application of similar standards across all country pages.

<user_id=Curb Chain>
I've commented on the DRN you filed but will elaborate here.
The problem is not with this page but the other pages.  Those are wrong years by your argument and I encourage you to be WP:BOLD to update/change the dates of years where the political entity formed.

<user_id=114.143.116.232>
No, I am not arguing that those dates are wrong. Of course there can be different points of view on what constituted the beginning of a nation but those dates for are more in keeping with the spirit of what I am saying. Which is that these current entities are merely the latest form of nations that have been around in one form or another for a long time. For India it might be worth considering the time of Ashoka as some sort of establishment date. Albeit that too will surely be contested with some saying it should be earlier. If for example it is decided to use 265 BCE (the Maurya Empire at its peak under Ashoka) as the date when the India that we recognize today truly came into being, then that would be the first date in the infobox and the significant subsequent periods could be mentioned under it, such as the Kushan Empire which followed the Maurya Empire, or the various Islamic ocupations, or the Maratha Empire, or the Sikh Empire, or the Company occupation, or the British occupation, etc.

<user_id=Guy Macon>
User 114.143.116.232, I couldn't help noticing that you filed a case at WP:DRN but have not returned to join the discussion or respond to the advice given there. Would you like me to close the case?

<user_id=114.143.119.26>
I don't understand why people keep repeating the 1947 date. That the British occupation ended on that date is simple fact beyond dispute. That is not what I am arguing about. I thought I was fairly clear on what I was trying to convey, which is that 1947 does not mark the beginning of the entity known as India. As for the specific point of this article referring to the 'political entity', that is precisely why I have drawn everyone's attention to other country pages, which even though are also about current 'political entities' use ancient dates for establishment/formation. I would like to put forward the date of 265 BCE as my contribution for a possible 'first date' in the infobox.

<user_id=Dharmadhyaksha>
And do you have a RS saying that India was established in 265 BCE? §§

<user_id=114.143.119.26>
We could use the same source(s) that establishes the extent of Ashoka's empire in the year 265 BCE. I don't think there is any doubt that Ashoka's Empire covered all of India at that time is there?

<user_id=114.143.119.26>
Kievan Rus' was a lot smaller than modern Russia. The Holy Roman Empire was a lot larger than modern Germany. Yet anyone with the slightest knowledge and understanding of history will recognize that those two entities were precursors to modern day Russia and Germany respectively. The area that is today Pakistan (and Bangladesh) has always been a part of India. Even the Mughal occupation at its peak did not cover the southern tip of India. The notion that Ashoka's India does not qualify as India because it included present-day Pakistan is ludicrous. I have already covered the greater/lesser argument. The logic of what I am saying should be abundantly clear to any unbiased listener. It is fairly evident that what we have here is merely good old-fashioned India hatred. I believe I have sufficiently made my point. I will not press this matter any further. This issue can now be considered closed.

<user_id=Fowler&fowler>
''Comment by Fowler&fowler;''' (Since this IP is forum shopping, I have to post here as well.)  This is a non-issue, mischief created and garbage dumped by an IP, who clearly doesn't have the courage to get a Wikipedia account and be responsible for his actions.  As a long-standing contributor to the India page (since 2006), I can say without hesitation, that the Republic of India, the subject of the India page, was established in 1950 after India gained independence in 1947.  There are all sorts of archaic and irredentist notions of ""India.""  Hindu nationalists in particular, with their notions of  Akhand Bharat (""Undivided India""), not only claim a provenance for their entity that even predates the beginning of recorded history in India, but also typically include many of India's current day neighbors in it.  As for Ashoka, the India page's ancient history section says, ""The (Mauryan) empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas."" So there you have it, all impeccably sourced.  What is ludicrous is that you think that a region controlled by a king, whose name was not even known to Indians until James Prinsep deciphered the Brahmi script, and who ruled some 2,300 years ago, when it took days if not months to even communicate between different regions, would have something like a modern nation state just because his edicts are found in disparate places.

<user_id=RegentsPark>
RK, the point is that we would need a reliable source that states that India was established in whatever year and then it becomes a point worth discussing. It's not for us to become arbiters on history by discussing amongst ourselves. That said, I don't think that India is like the uni-ethnic Germany at all. India is a multi-ethnic society with many nations and overlapping histories and is more akin to Europe than it is to any single European nation.

<user_id=114.143.119.26>
That fowler is heavily biased is fairly clear. An earlier participant had asked me what I believed should be the first date in the infobox and I had merely offered 265 BCE as my suggestion. I was not claiming it to be final in any way. It just seems like a strong candidate. If you take a look at one of my earlier comments you will see that I had guessed that others might offer even earlier dates. All I wanted was a discussion and for uniformity in the infoboxes of various countries. Fowler's warped logic seems to be that because India was under British occupation for 190 or 90 years depending on how one views the situation, it was a colony, and therefore a 'lesser' country than a Germany or a Russia which were never colonies. That is the core of his argument. It is risible, crude and not worth entertaining. Those genuinely interested in this matter should carry-on this debate about what would make a good first date in the infobox. A good way to start would be to look at other country pages and get a sense of the logic of my argument.

<user_id=Dharmadhyaksha>
A good way to start would be you coming up with a date backed with reliable sources. We aren't shopping for a wedding gown here to keep trying all and then agree on one. §§

<user_id=114.143.119.26>
I am trying to figure out if you are genuinely interested in the discussion or simply want to annoy all concerned. Can you not see that I have mentioned the date 265 BCE half a dozen times. As for the source for that date we could use the same source(s) that establishes beyond dispute the extent of Ashoka's Empire at its peak.

",1,"The discussion revolves around the appropriate date to be used in the infobox for the establishment/formation of India on its Wikipedia page. The main points of contention are whether to use the date of India's independence from British rule in 1947, or to use an earlier historical date that reflects the long-standing cultural and geographic entity of India.

User 114.143.116.232 argues for an earlier date, suggesting 265 BCE, the time of Ashoka's empire, as a potential establishment date for India. They argue that other country pages, such as those for China and Germany, use ancient dates that reflect the historical origins of the countries rather than the modern political entity's formation date.

User MilborneOne counters by stating that the article in question is about the modern country of India, which did not exist before 1947. They suggest that historical context is important but that the current political entity should be the focus of the infobox date.

User Curb Chain suggests that if the user believes other pages are incorrect, they should be bold and update those pages to reflect the correct political entity formation dates.

User Dharmadhyaksha asks for a reliable source that states India was established in 265 BCE, emphasizing the need for verifiable information.

User Fowler&fowler points out that the Republic of India was established in 1950 and that the notion of India as a nation-state is a modern concept, not applicable to ancient times.

User RegentsPark highlights the need for a reliable source to support any claim about India's establishment date and notes that India's multi-ethnic society is more akin to Europe than to a single European nation.

The quality of the arguments varies throughout the discussion. User 114.143.116.232 presents a perspective that is not uncommon in historical debates, but they fail to provide reliable sources to back their claim, which weakens their argument. User MilborneOne, User Curb Chain, User Dharmadhyaksha, User Fowler&fowler, and User RegentsPark all emphasize the importance of reliable sources, the focus on the modern political entity, and the complexity of India's history, which strengthens their arguments.

The discussion is somewhat circular, with User 114.143.116.232 repeatedly asserting their viewpoint without addressing the core issue raised by others about the need for reliable sources. The other users maintain a consistent stance on the importance of sourcing and the definition of the modern nation-state.

Overall, the discussion is somewhat productive in that it highlights the complexity of defining historical dates for countries with long histories. However, the lack of consensus and the repeated arguments without new evidence or sources detract from the quality of the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Edit war over post-metal in infobox

<user_id=Fezmar9>
The details contained within an infobox are meant to be more general than specific. Deftones' music has been noted to be influenced by a number of different genres over the years. Hell, the musical style section of this article lists a dozen or so different styles that Deftones have been referred to as. But the infobox should not contain all 12 of these genres. Which ones should it contain? Maybe two or three of the genres most commonly used to describe the band's sound overall. In my own research, the top two are typically nu metal or alternative metal. The sources provided in this article currently do not describe the band's overall sound to be post-metal. The ''Honolulu Weekly'' continuously being added by Trascendence does not describe Deftones' overall sound as post-metal, but merely says the band ""dabbles"" in various genres such as post-metal. In fact, I don't think any of the five sources in the style section say Deftones' overall sound can be described as post-metal. For these reasons, in addition to the reasons found in HrZ's edit summaries, I do not support the inclusion of post-metal into the infobox.

<user_id=NJZombie>
I agree. Additionally, unless I'm mistaken, aren't sub-genres not to be included within infoboxes? It's not a policy I necessarily agree with myself, but I seem to remember that being the guideline.

<user_id=Trascendence>
-In favor of post-metal
I don't understand why  now says that don't supports it, because he is a regular editor of the article and post-metal was added when he was around  (see May 22 onwards, his name appears three times after post-metal was added) he was aware of the addition and seemed to be ok with it.
The question here rather than why post-metal must be added would be why this source  is enough to add ""experimental rock"" to the infobox, but when comes to add post-metal, using the same source, then ""it's not enough"". Post-metal have more sources than experimental rock has, and unlike nu-metal there are no writers and reviewers saying that Deftones was lazily/accidentaly labeled as such (that without mentioning that Deftones haven't played anything close to it in more of 10 years), wich if doing a WP:UNDUE balance, would leave nu-metal out. If anything post-metal has more supporters than any of these two and there is no real reason to leave it out at all, this looks as if other editors had some personal opinion about the band not playing post-metal or not being post-metal enough, disregarding all the sources that backs up the genre, and also ignoring that wikipedia is not about personal opinions, but verifiable sources.

<user_id=Fezmar9>
Neither of  your bullet points seem at all relevant, nor are your opinions backed up by reliable sources. I have 1,200+ pages on my watchlist and I also have a job and attend school. I don't have the time to check every single edit on my watchlist. My interest in this article has mostly pertained to recent events in the band's history; I really don't care about edits made elsewhere and I only stepped in because I saw an edit war beginning. Experimental rock in the infobox is an entirely different argument. This discussion is specifically about post-metal's inclusion in the infobox.

<user_id=Fezmar9>
The following points of yours are purely opinion and not backed up by any evidence: ""Post-metal have more sources than experimental rock has,"" ""unlike nu-metal there are no writers and reviewers saying that Deftones was lazily/accidentaly labeled as such (that without mentioning that Deftones haven't played anything close to it in more of 10 years)"" and ""post-metal has more supporters than any of these two and there is no real reason to leave it out at all.""

<user_id=Fezmar9>
Now, let me illustrate this point with a table. The following illustrates various genres Deftones are sometimes labelled as, and the number of times an article in Google News' archives associates Deftones with a given genre. It should not be assumed that the number hits directly correlates to the number of articles that actually ''call'' the band this genre, as it's entirely possible that there's an article about another band that happens to mention Deftones. However, this simple Gnews test should give a pretty rough idea of what published and authoritative sources refer to the band's genre as. Notice how post-metal, and what you claim to be a synonym of post-metal, ""metalgaze,"" have the fewest hits? It's easy to infer from this chart that Deftones playing post-metal is a minority opinion at best. This table also suggests that your earlier points of post-metal having more supporters than experimental is invalid.

<user_id=Trascendence>
My points are relevant because i have the sources to back up my statements and i'm acting accord to Wikipedia's policies. How can experimental rock and post-metal be a different argument when both appears in the same source and wikipedia criteria must remain the same for all the content included in the sources?

<user_id=Yawaraey>
Actually, you searched ""deftones"" ""nu metal"" for everyone of them. If you search any of the other genres, nu metal and alternative metal were the only ones that showed up more then ten times. Post-metal showed up four times and ""metalgaze"", zero.
Also, experimental rock only showed up once, so, you should be more careful lest you want that removed.

<user_id=Fezmar9>
I cannot account for this discrepancy. Though each link clearly has nu metal in the URL, clicking on each link correctly brings me to the proper search results reflecting the same exact data I have provided—this might be due to Google's new feature where it searches for results while you finish typing. Maybe part of the search is saved in my computer's memory, while the rest is in the URL? How did you perform your own searches? I had both the band's name and the genre in their own quotes in my search box (<""Deftones"" ""nu metal""> OR <""Deftones"" ""alt metal"">), also performed a Gnews Archived search. Regular Google News only searches for results within the last few weeks, but a Google News Archive search digs up hits older than the last few weeks.

<user_id=Yawaraey>
I just replaced ""nu metal"" in your search results with tags such as ""alt metal"", ""alternative metal"", etcetera.

<user_id=Fezmar9>
Hm, I really don't know what to say. I just clicked on all those links using a different computer on a different network, and they worked just fine. Can someone else try clicking on the links and see if they experience the same issues as yawaraey? Alternatively, could someone pull up a Google News Archive Search (without clicking the links provided) and try to conduct the same searches?

<user_id=HrZ>
Links all work fine with me. Also, I'm not going to reiterate what I said in my edit summaries or what I have said to Trascendence on his talk page, but I do not support the inclusion of post-metal into the infobox. On another note, with this edit Trascendence removed more of the hidden note, without explanation.

<user_id=Trascendence>
I removed that part of the hidden advise because it was the same message repeated another two times. Not sure how these links works for you, but when i click into nu metal there is only 17 results, anyway, to search words is not a legit way to validate your statements or in fact anything, use articles that clearly refer to the band as nu metal, stills, there is nothing that refutes Deftones being post-metal.

<user_id=HrZ>
I'm sure there is a reason it has been repeated, perhaps so that no one could ignore it? Anyway I could be wrong but I'm sure this discussion is wither or not there is enough for it's inclusion in the infobox as a prominent genre along with the three already there, not wither or not their music is post-metal. The source you provided states that they dabble in numerous subgenres listing post-metal among them. Doesn't say outright that they are a post-metal band. The fact that there is a source is no reason either, because a number of genres (including nu metal and experimental rock) have sources in the musical style and influences section of the article (it should be noted that the sources provided for metalgaze and post-metal in that section were deemed unreliable in a previous discussion). As Fezmar9 said, it would be ridiculous to include all of these genres in the infobox. Why should post-metal be included instead of any other genre? If the arguement is simply ""it has more sources"" then it would help you're arguement if you could provide them, making sure they are reliable by Wikipedia's standards. The reasons for their being sources in the infobox in the first place is due to the genre warring that happened constantly over a year ago (see this discussion). It was due to this warring that the notes stating ""Discuss any changes through the ""discussion"" tab before making them"" were added to the article.

<user_id=Trascendence>
Down in the ""musical style"" section post-metal is the genre with more references, and from these, at least three does it fine regarding the reliable sources topic (so much that are used to back up another statements in this article).

<user_id=HrZ>
There are enough sources that it merits a mention in the article (which it already does) but having ""more references"" isn't a valid arguement seeing as how some should be removed or moved. The ''Honolulu Weeky'' merely states they have dabbled in post-metal. Straight.com states only shoegaze not post-metal. Sputnikmusic mentions post-rock, not post-metal (pretty sure I mentioned that in a previous discussion). And Thrash Hits isn't considered reliable. Creative Loathing does refer to ''White Pony'' as a ""shoegaze-metal"" but that leaves you with barely two sources. So why should it be included in the infobox above any other sourced sub-genre?

<user_id=Trascendence>
Because if we apply the same highly demanding criteria that you're applying to post-metal any of these other genres will barely have reliable support at all. Actually Thrash hits is now borderline , while is prefered to keep it away in controversial topics, this is not the case, because there is another five sources (Three of them reliable) claiming the same thing.

<user_id=HrZ>
Borderline? Now you appear to be selective; ""You might be correct, if you could prove he vets every article on the site, or that he wrote the article in question. Neither of those facts is true though. '''Ergo, not RS'''"" is the last reply from the editor (as of this posting, there may be more replies by the time you read this). And where is the five sources? Not all the sources after post-metal in the musical section are sources for post-metal, one is just for shoegaze, one says post-rock (to quote an earlier reply from you: ""'''use articles that clearly refer''' to the band as nu metal."" Clearly this article doesn't say post-metal) and Thrash Hits is not unreliable per your own check at the reliable sources noticeboard. Honolulu Weekly has been used more than once, I hope you are not counting that as more than one source. So again, you only really have two, Honolulu Weekly and Creative Loathing. And what about what the sources state? One album (not the band's overall sound) is labelled as shoegaze-metal while another source states they have simply dabbled in post-metal. This doesn't give the impression of a prominent genre. But what is your arguement for it's inclusion in the infobox (when it's already included in the article)? All I could gather is that post-metal has some sources but no reason as to why it should be included in the infobox.

<user_id=Trascendence>
As i said above if we were willing to apply the same highly demanding criteria that you're applying to post-metal any of these other genres will barely have reliable support at all. Post-metal would still among the most sourced genres, that's why, and it's a fact that Deftones music is refered as post-metal more often than experimental rock and is less debated than nu metal, if anything post metal have more weight than these two.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Genre Classification**: The discussion revolves around whether the genre ""post-metal"" should be included in the infobox of the Deftones Wikipedia page. The participants are debating the appropriateness of this classification based on the number of sources that support the genre as a descriptor of the band's music.

2. **Arguments for Inclusion**: Trascendence argues for the inclusion of post-metal in the infobox, stating that there are reliable sources that refer to Deftones as post-metal and that this genre is less debated than nu metal and more often referred to than experimental rock.

3. **Arguments against Inclusion**: Fezmar9 and HrZ argue against the inclusion, stating that the infobox should contain only the most commonly used genres to describe the band's overall sound. They also point out that the sources provided do not describe the band's overall sound as post-metal but rather suggest that the band dabbles in it.

4. **Evidence and Sources**: Fezmar9 presents a table with Google News hits as a rough indicator of how frequently the band is associated with various genres. Trascendence challenges the methodology and suggests that the search may not be accurate. HrZ questions the reliability of the sources provided by Trascendence and the interpretation of those sources.

5. **Wikipedia Policies**: NJZombie brings up Wikipedia guidelines regarding the inclusion of sub-genres in infoboxes, suggesting that there might be a policy against it.

6. **Consistency and Precedent**: The discussion also touches on the consistency of applying Wikipedia's criteria for including genres in the infobox and the precedent set by previous discussions on the topic.

7. **Quality of Arguments**: The quality of the arguments varies. Fezmar9 and HrZ provide clear reasoning for why post-metal should not be included in the infobox, emphasizing the need for a general description and the lack of sources describing the band's overall sound as post-metal. Trascendence's arguments are less convincing, as they rely on the assertion that post-metal is less debated and more often referred to than other genres without providing strong evidence to support these claims.

Overall, the discussion shows a reasonable level of engagement with the topic, with participants providing evidence and referencing Wikipedia policies. However, there are discrepancies in the interpretation of sources and the methodology for determining the prevalence of genre descriptors. The discussion could benefit from a more structured approach to evaluating sources and a clearer understanding of Wikipedia's guidelines for infobox content.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5

I think the infobox should be changed to the one that the Prime Minister of the UK and the President of the US have. It look much more professional and has more info, like the residence and website. I have tried to change it but someone keeps cahnging it back so I would like to disscuss it here and see what everyone thinks. Tell me if you like it or not. (To see what it would look like see the President of the US or Prime Minister of the UK page.)

If you wanted more information in the box, all you had to do was change the template or ask someone to do it for you. I have put into the template used here the additional slots the other one has.

<user_id=Miesianiacal>
The template you keep deleting was designed so as to use a colour coding system to differentiate between ministers in simple states and federations, as well as between federal and provincial/state ministers in the latter. You are not entitled to bulldoze all of that out of the way because you don't like it or because of what's done on other pages (though, the infobox employed here is used on other articles as well).

<user_id=174.7.14.105>
Okay... I still don't agree. The Prime Minister of the UK has almost the exact same job as the Prime Minster of Canada so they should have the same infobox. It makes no difference. It would look better and more professional and the info it the same. I don't care if it was designed for whatever. When something needs to be changed to something more modern and better looking we should change it. I am willing to change all the provincial and federal position that have that.

Now, you're inserting incorrect information into the box, particularly about the Prime Minister's term. The constitutional maximum life of a parliament is completely irrelevant.

Never mind, actually. I've managed to fix it.

FWIW: ways the PM leaves office. 1) can be fired by the Queen (through the Governor General) - See King-Byng Affair as an example. 2) resign from office, which is what out-going PM's do. 3) die in office, such as Macdonald & Thompson.

<user_id=Miesianiacal>
True. But, why did you italicise the date of Harper's appontment as PM? have you not inserted the date of Harper's appointment properly - in the right field and without italics?

<user_id=GoodDay>
I was trying to get to match the other 'office incumbent' infoboxes. PS: The out-going PM has to resign ''before'' his/her successor is appointed. In theory, one could be PM permanently (until death, resignation, getting fired). Of course, the Queen/GG tend to bend to Parliament's wishes.

<user_id=Miesianiacal>
Fixed to be in line with the other infoboxes, GD (as earlier noted to you elsewhere).
Now, I wonder if the anon (or his/her brother - difficult to tell as they use the same IP and seem to hold the exact same opinions) would care to explain why we should include code for an infobox field that doesn't exist.

",0,"The discussion begins with user 174.7.14.105 suggesting a change to the infobox template to match that of the Prime Minister of the UK and the President of the US, arguing that it looks more professional and contains more information. The user expresses frustration over their edits being reverted and seeks to discuss the matter with the community.

User Miesianiacal responds by explaining the purpose of the existing template, which includes a color-coding system to differentiate between various types of ministers. Miesianiacal also points out that the user should discuss changes before implementing them, referencing the Wikipedia policy WP:BRD (Bold, Revert, Discuss).

User 174.7.14.105 continues to push for the change, emphasizing aesthetics and a desire for uniformity with other similar pages. However, they do not provide a strong argument for why the change is necessary beyond personal preference.

Miesianiacal, on the other hand, provides a rationale for the existing template and offers to work on incorporating the additional information requested by user 174.7.14.105 without changing the entire template. This shows a willingness to compromise and improve the template while maintaining its original purpose.

The discussion then shifts to a more technical debate about the correct information to be included in the infobox, with Miesianiacal correcting inaccuracies introduced by user 174.7.14.105.

User GoodDay joins the conversation, providing additional context on how a Prime Minister can leave office, which contributes to the accuracy of the information in the infobox.

Throughout the discussion, Miesianiacal demonstrates a stronger command of Wikipedia policies, guidelines, and the technical aspects of the infobox template. User 174.7.14.105, while passionate, lacks the same level of detail in their arguments and does not adhere to Wikipedia's collaborative editing practices.

Overall, the discussion quality is moderate. While there are moments of constructive dialogue and attempts at compromise, there are also instances of disregard for Wikipedia's editing policies and a focus on personal preference over community consensus.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5

Google books survey

<user_id=Olli Niemitalo>
I had a look at the first 40 hits returned by a Google books search on '''""resource based economy""'''. It appears that the main definition contrasts resource-based economies with knowledge/human/service-based ones. The alternative definition is used in 4 books (10 %), 2 of which are by Fresco. That is very marginal especially concerning third parties, so the weight of the alternative definition in the article should be kept at a minimum and the article structuring/wording should not convey the impression that it is a majority definition. I don't think that the alternative definition should be completely removed, because it is still a borderline significant majority and a lot of people are probably going to be looking for that definition in particular.

<user_id=The Banner>
It is indeed interesting to see that the alternative use of the term is used by four books in the first 20 hits (5 in the top 40, based on the summaries). Still a Google Books search on ''""venus project"" OR fresco OR zeitgeist ""resource based economy""'' gives 297 books, 30 hits on Google Scholar and 7800000 hits on Google Search. Certainly not something to ignore.

<user_id=The Banner>
BTW: have you seen my new draft, mentioned just above here?

<user_id=Olli Niemitalo>
I saw your proposal, but I just wanted to share the survey results and be gone.

<user_id=Earl King Jr.>
Okay, replaced ""Economic model"" by ""economic theory/ideology"". In fact, it is funny. I find thousands of links to Fresco/Venusproject/Zeitgeist-related items, but I can't find a definition of the ""normal"" use. Night of the Big Wind' From above.
As a reference to the articles ala what Night of the Big Wind is saying, their version is probably ok with the 'theory ideology' part adjustment. Its doubtful there is a 'normal use' because this article was crafted a certain way with the ''Resource-based economy'' phrase being spelled a certain way, the way Fresco 'invented' it, (according to Fresco http://thevenusproject.com/the-venus-project/resource-based-economy )

<user_id=The Banner>
The interesting thing is that what I called ""the normal use"" is mainly found in books and scientific articles. Fresco/Zeitgeist/Venus Project-type use is severely underrepresented there. But with Google Search it is just the other way round. I get the idea that the use related to producing and exporting raw materials is the oldest of the two, that is why I call it ""normal use"". But again, I am not an economist, just some fool trying to draft a new version to stop an editwar.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
No, you are completely right. There is definitely a ""normal"" academic use of the term, and then a new use after The Venus Project got all the hype some years ago, with Fresco completely unrelated usage of the term. It is unfortunate that he started using this term in this completely misleading way, but it is an effect if hi also not being an economist and also have no clue what he is talking about. -) But it's nothing we can do anything to fix, utopianists are now talking left and right about a ""Resource-based economy"" and thinking it is something new and different, when it's just a new word for technocratic communism (and boy would I love it if some economist would actually write something about it).

<user_id=Earl King Jr.>
Its pretty much all based on this biophysical economics with a strong dose of this history . The original technocrats had nothing to do with Communism or Capitalism or Socialism etc which according to their information was not connected to resource based economics using an energy metric of value instead of money. Anyway that was the original meaning from the early 1930's, example link,

<user_id=Earl King Jr.>
I just found these two things http://technocracy.org/transition/economy/279-transition-doll and this http://conspiracies.skepticproject.com/articles/zeitgeist-addendum/ Is it worth using either? Steven Doll is or at least was a member of Venus Project and Technocracy group. Fresco an ex technocrat pretty much got the idea from Technocracy source.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
I don't see how they can be labeled reliable sources for anything they say.

<user_id=Earl King Jr.>
Steven Doll is or was a board member of Fresco's when he incorporated his ideas as Venus Project or 'Future' by design or what ever he calls it. He lives in Florida. He and Fresco are friends or so it seems. He was/is also a member of the main Technocracy group where he is an essay writer and thus an official speaker published by TechInc on their website.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
Doesn't matter. See WP:RS.

<user_id=Biophily>
To say that the Technocracy movement uses the term resource based economy is too severe of a generalization. The over-generalization is so glaring it is nearly erroneous. I don't understand how one could think that Fresco, would pick up the phrase from Doll (a very obscure technocrat by the way), who used the term only once in one article, the single and only article of Technocracy that ever used it, and then believe that Fresco would go on to based his entire ideology around this term. Good reason should suggest the contrary: Doll used Fresco's term. In fact, I have heard recordings from 1973 in which Fresco explains this term.

<user_id=Earl King Jr.>
The term is a spinoff of biophysical economics, energy economics and has very little to nothing to do with original thinking of Fresco. Technocracy groups probably used it one way or another, the same ideas from 1918 on. Fresco got most of his information from Technocracy groups in the mid to late 1940's. He is a former member. Steven Doll helped Fresco incorporate his ideas Google or ''search'' 'Steven Doll Venus Project'. He is was or is integral to Fresco's setting up his group and he is still a part of it it looks like. Doll may seem obscure to you but he is a known published essay writer. From the tone of your post you sound almost angry about your opinions here. Take it easy. Its a controversial subject because of the groups in questions which have cult like followings.

<user_id=Biophily>
Be sure, I'm not angry. The claim in the article just strikes me as misinformative. It's too much of a stretch. It is probably true that biophysical economics and a resource based economy represent the same idea. But there are no sources that state that, that I know of, and they are in fact two different terms that I feel no one here has the right to conflate. The article could be modified to be more specific about this issue. If it can be shown that the Technocracy movement used it much more often, or that biophysical economics is equivalent to a resource based economy by some source, then I would take no issue. If not, I recommend that the article be modified to reflect the limitedness of the fact in question.

<user_id=Earl King Jr.>
Technocracy group in their official information advocate a resource based economy. Just because that is not repeated over and over does not matter. It is a part of their official information presentation on their official website http://surepost.com/igdtech/technocracy/eco1.php Accounting For Nature, by Steven Doll.
Much like the rest of the article where do you draw the line? Fresco uses the ''-'' to make resource'-'based economy, does the '-' make it a proprietary term? Something he invented? No. The people being discussed are apparent friends. What came first, the chicken or the egg and does it matter? It is a fact that Technocracy the ''group'' uses the term and it is currently a part of their information and it appears that some persons probably cross over between all the three groups mentioned though they are in no way affiliated with each other. As a former technocrat Fresco learned something while being involved with them probably. Probably the larger part of his philosophy comes from their material with different twists and turns. That is speculation but it looks that way. Just because Fresco and Zeitgeist have lots of redundant information on the same topic does not gain notability or importance. All it takes is one endorsement of an idea and published material on an official website that is current. Doll has published elsewhere. I think his full name is Steven L. Doll.

<user_id=Biophily>
I suppose it's not worth much more push, but I look at it this way: Imagine if a communist of modest reputation used the term positively in one of his essays. Would it be right to say, ""The Zeitgeist Movement and Technocracy Movement uses the term resource-based economy, as do the Communists"" ?

<user_id=Earl King Jr.>
That is probably a bad example because of the connection of the two groups personality wise. Fresco having gotten his basic ideas from ideas of energy accounting. No connection to your example, and the essay by Doll says ''Converting to a resource-based economy will require a monumental change in our thinking.'' since he is an official speaker to Technocracy Movement the citation is proof of using the term. That is pretty blatant. Energy accounting would be a resource based economy. That is a verifiable citation. That is what counts.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
One person using the word ""resource-based economy"" in one article on a website does not mean that the whole movement can be said to use the term in any reasonable sense. If it would be on a Technocracy Movement FAQ, sure. If the article said ""The aim of the Technocracy Movement is to reach a resource.based economy"" or something like that, yes. But this is not the case here. This article is also the single article on that ""Technocracy Research Library"" page that uses the term. There is no basis for saying that the technocracy movement uses the term.

<user_id=Earl King Jr.>
Wrong. That may be your opinion but you have your facts wrong. Its not just ''one'' website it is the official Technocracy website. It is not just one person, it is an official published essay writer for Technocracy. It says in black and white the same term and it is being used in the same way. The groups are historically connected though not literally connected. So, please stop removing information that is cited from the article. Even the other editor wanted to ''qualify'' the information not remove it  Removing a citation that proves a connection? Why?

<user_id=OpenFuture>
Because it doesn't prove a connection. Even if it is an ""official essay"" (it's definitely not ""published"" in the normal sense of Wikipedia) this does not prove that the movement as a whole uses it regularly, In fact the complete absence of the term from other technocracy materials indicates that they don't. Including this material is original research. You are not a reliable source.

<user_id=Earl King Jr.>
Wrong again. Its published Published in: The Northwest Technocrat, 4th quarter 1994, No. 337. That means it goes out to libraries and other readership just like any other piece of information from an organization. It mentions the term ''resource-based economy'' It uses the term. What do you mean by regularly? Why remove the information when it can be qualified? The other editor qualified it, not removed it. You did not answer those questions. What do you mean by ''You are not a reliable source?''. What has that got to do with anything? Why are you calling ''me'' not a reliable source? Your commenting on ''me'' and not the issue which is the source and citation and the wording and the connection. It says that the Technocracy movement ''uses the term''. It is documented that they use the term. The criteria is not whether the ''whole movement'' which is very nebulous says it but the official information says it, published it and has stuck with that information to the current time.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
Not exactly a peer-reviewed journal is it? -) But, OK let's not argue about the definition of ""published"". It's practically irrelevant anyway, as the source does not claim that the Technocracy Movement uses the term. It is one article, by one person in the technocracy movement. Claiming that therefore ""The Technocracy Movement"" uses the term is not supported by that source.
'""It is documented that they use the term.""'' - No, it is not.
'""the official information says it""'' - No, it does not. An article by a person in the movement is not ""official information"". An offical FAQ would be official information. By your logic, if say, The Rand Institute published an article where they discuss TZM / TVP and how resource-based economy is just another word for utopian techocratic communist (I can dream, can't I?) you could then claim that Rand ""uses the term"" which either is absurd, or reduces the meaning of ""uses"" to meaninglessness.
To claim that the technocracy movement uses the term, you have to have either a source that they do use it, or you need to show that they do so in ""official information"" or at least that the term is pervasive within the movement.
Once again: One article, by one person does not a movement make.

<user_id=OpenFuture>
And since I don't want to edit war about it, and since I don't want to escalate this sort of ridiculous nonsense, please self-revert.

",1,"The discussion revolves around whether the term ""resource-based economy"" is used by the Technocracy Movement and if it should be included in the Wikipedia article. The participants are debating the validity of sources, the interpretation of the term's usage, and the historical context of the term.

1. **Argument about the definition and usage of ""resource-based economy""**: The initial argument by Olli Niemitalo is based on a survey of Google Books hits, which is a reasonable approach to gauge the prevalence of a term's definition. The argument is that the alternative definition (related to Fresco's Venus Project) is marginal and should not be overrepresented in the article.

2. **Argument about the prevalence of the term in various sources**: The Banner points out that the term, when associated with the Venus Project and related concepts, has a significant number of hits on Google Books, Scholar, and Search. This is a valid point that suggests the term has gained traction in certain circles, even if it is not prevalent in academic literature.

3. **Argument about the historical use of the term by the Technocracy Movement**: Earl King Jr. argues that the term ""resource-based economy"" is connected to the Technocracy Movement and biophysical economics, which predates Fresco's use. This argument is based on historical connections and the sharing of ideas, which is a plausible line of reasoning.

4. **Argument about the reliability of sources**: OpenFuture challenges the use of certain sources to support the claim that the Technocracy Movement uses the term. The argument is based on Wikipedia's standards for reliable sources and the distinction between one person's use of a term and the movement's official stance. This is a strong argument that emphasizes the need for clear evidence of widespread use within the movement.

5. **Argument about the interpretation of one person's article as representative of a movement**: Biophily and OpenFuture both argue that using one person's article to represent the entire Technocracy Movement's stance is an overgeneralization. This is a logical point that aligns with the need for multiple sources to establish a pattern or consensus within a group.

6. **Argument about the significance of the connection between individuals and movements**: Earl King Jr. argues that the personal connections between individuals like Steven Doll and Jacque Fresco and their respective movements lend credibility to the claim that the term is used by the Technocracy Movement. However, this argument is weaker because it relies on assumptions about influence rather than documented use of the term by the movement as a whole.

Overall, the discussion quality is mixed. Some participants provide well-reasoned arguments based on source reliability and the need for evidence of widespread use within a movement. Others rely on less concrete connections and individual interpretations. The discussion could benefit from a more structured approach to evidence and a clearer understanding of the standards for source reliability and representation of a group's views.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=MrX>
AC and the induction motor

<user_id=MrX>
I have reworded a couple of sentences in this section for clarity, but removed this (in red) as WP:UNDUE:
The motor worked with a polyphase current  He received a US patent for the motor in May 1888. 

<user_id=MrX>
In my opinion, this last sentence is tangential and not important to understanding Tesla. As long as we don't make peacock claims about Tesla being the first/best/biggest/baddest, then there is no reason to explain the history of alternating current in such detail. I took out the definition of polyphase, assuming that interested readers can click on the wiki link if they want to learn more.-

<user_id=Fountains of Bryn Mawr>
Three reasons for the rewrite by me before your removal to talk.
MOS:JARGON requests that technical terms be defined in text in the article: do not force a reader to follow the link to understand a term. (Assume the reader is reading a hard copy with no wikilinks).
Readers will come to this article assuming Tesla invented AC (and the article currently does not tell them any different). The point in time in AC development should be explained.

<user_id=Fountains of Bryn Mawr>
The reason ''why'' AC was preferable/being developed has been in the article for a while and should still be there.

<user_id=Atlantictire>
I have a version of that section that explains the advantages of AC right away in the first paragraph (long distance transmission, ready conversion to different voltages). I didn't post it, because I didn't want to edit war and I wasn't confident it wouldn't be reverted or re-revised. But yes, that is better.

<user_id=MrX>
Which ""that"" are you referring to?-

<user_id=MrX>
@Fountains of Bryn Mawr: I'm flexible about the jargon, if others agree. I did consider rewording that part, for example replacing 'feeding' with 'supplying'. I can't get on board with the premise that people come to this article assuming that Tesla invented AC (unless they are electrical engineers, perhaps). I think people come here because they read or viewed videos that portray Tesla as a mad genius who made huge coils, that spewed 20 foot longs bolts of lightning, and that could alter space and time. I think Tesla's role in the commercialization of AC is important and historic, but I don't think it's a major theme for his biography.-

<user_id=Fountains of Bryn Mawr>
Judging by whats on the number one viral site on the internet, The Oatmeal, in black and white in many many books, and every Tesla question I have seen on Yahoo Answers, a whole lot of people think Tesla invented AC.

<user_id=Atlantictire>
You version. It's less misleading. There's no danger that anyone with at least a 5th grade reading comprehension will come away from that thinking Tesla invented AC. Sorry, I'm too fed up with this. Patience: gone. Gonna recuse myself for the evening from Wikipedia.

<user_id=MrX>
Perhaps, but we have to rely on our reliable sources and follow the relative WEIGHT in those sources. Your quandary is that the many many books that claim Tesla invented AC, works directly against the content that you wish to include. The sentence, at least as written, is not faithful to the collective Tesla biographies, as far as I can tell. It also introduces a topic in a way that seems to rebut a claim that was never made, which teeters on the edge of WP:OR.
I hope we are not writing this article to address the positively poor information dispensed at various sites like Yahoo Answers, or various fan sites across the internet. Show me some scholarly mainstream debate about Tesla inventing versus not inventing AC, and I will reconsider my view on this. -

<user_id=Fountains of Bryn Mawr>
My ""quandary"" is that we should state the obvious and define jargon. He worked in the ''formative years of electric power development'' (near the very beginning of AC development), its in the lead in short form, it should be in the body in long form. It should be there because of WP:OBVIOUS. We should follow WP:JARGON. We can skip stating his position in the development of AC if you want. Readers can always infer that from whats given, or yeah..... we would have to explain he did not blow up Tunguska, create free energy, have J P Morgan yelling ""where do you put a meter on this thing?"" at him, dematerialize a ship in Philadelphia, or build a particle beam weapon in his New York apartment in the 1930's (oops, do we say that? ;)).

<user_id=Atlantictire>
No,  FOBM, what you're proposing is misleading POV. Tesla designed and built the first practical AC induction motor. It really is that simple. , we may need to have a RfC on this as we did on Tesla's birthplace.

<user_id=MrX>
The main issue I have with the parenthetical explanation of polyphase current is that it really doesn't work well to explain to the lay reader what it is. Anecdotally, I tried to explain this very concept to my neighbor a couple of days ago when a lightning storm cause one phase to cut out, causing our air conditioners (but not other appliances) to stop working. Their response was a blank stare of confusion. I would expect that our average reader does not even understand alternating current, so how could they be expected to understand 'out of phase current'?

<user_id=MrX>
Since there is no claim in the article that Tesla invented AC, the most neutral presentation of the material would require omitting content about contemporaneous AC research and development. I'm open to an RfC, or perhaps others will join this discussion so that we can establish a clearer consensus.-

<user_id=Fountains of Bryn Mawr>
Per WP:YESPOV and Check your facts no. It would not be a ""true"" statement and we do not ''state seriously contested assertions as facts'' (per policy). We could present the sides but that makes the section longer and go off topic.

<user_id=Fountains of Bryn Mawr>
I see agreement on ""The reason why AC was preferable/being developed"" / ""Tesla's role in the commercialization of AC"" / ""advantages of AC"" leading to the sentence ""''At that time alternating current power systems were starting to be built in Europe and the US because of AC's advantages in long distance high voltage transmission''"" or some form of that. '''Opposed''' to RfC because it would be an RfC on something clearly spelled out at WP:YESPOV. This is not the place to rehash Wikipedia policy.

<user_id=Atlantictire>
''Support''' RfC (if it comes to this) because this is the consensus among Carlson et al.

<user_id=Fountains of Bryn Mawr>
Carlson does not support first to ""design"" and no consensus amongst sources, way to many sources call this an independent co-invention (last two declare both designs not ""practical"").

<user_id=Atlantictire>
I don't have time for this. Someone else? Re-read the entire passage upthread from Carlson. It's under the green hat.
If you want to waste your time reading through all those links FOBM just provided and explain to him how they don't at all support his claim that Tesla doesn't deserve credit for designing and building the first practical AC motor be my guest. I've been playing this game for almost a week now, and it's somebody else's turn.

<user_id=Atlantictire>
I think we ought to state in the first paragraph what the AC fuss was all about. I would add information about the advantages of AC and take out the bit about the Peck Brown profit sharing agreement. We do learn 2 paragraphs later about the sums Brown and Peck negotiated for Tesla, and right now the priority is to understand ""why AC"" without overburdening the paragraph.
Here's how I'd re-write it:
In April 1887, Tesla formed the Tesla Electric Company, financed by New York attorney Charles F. Peck and Alfred S. Brown, the director of Western Union. They established a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan so he could work on his alternating current motor and other devices for power distribution. Unlike direct current, alternating current is readily converted to different voltages and is transmissible over long distances.

<user_id=Fountains of Bryn Mawr>
I checked references on the paragraph I was adding to and found them inaccurate. I rewrote the this paragraph (and reverted it back) because it is factually wrong. Per Carlson, Seifer and other reference checks, Brown was not ""the director of Western Union"", he just worked there (and helped to set up a rival company), Tesla worked on improvements for existing motors and generators, DC devices, AC devices, a Thermo-magnetic motor, etc - it was not just to work on AC, and they did not ""share equally"" in profits. AC was not the primary reason for the business venture (Peck was not particularly interested in AC). This article is a BIO to accurately describe Tesla, some ins and outs of his business relationships are part of that.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Understanding of the Subject**: The participants demonstrate a strong understanding of the subject matter, discussing the intricacies of Nikola Tesla's work and the history of alternating current (AC). They reference specific historical details and patents, showing a deep engagement with the topic.

2. **Use of Sources**: The discussants reference various sources, including scholarly works like those by Carlson, to support their arguments. They emphasize the importance of relying on reliable sources and not perpetuating misinformation found on less credible sites or popular media.

3. **Clarity and Relevance**: The participants aim for clarity in the article, debating how to best explain technical terms like ""polyphase current"" to lay readers. They consider the reader's perspective and the potential for misunderstanding complex concepts.

4. **Policy and Guidelines**: The discussants reference Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, such as WP:UNDUE, WP:JARGON, WP:OBVIOUS, and WP:YESPOV, to support their positions. This shows a commitment to maintaining the quality and neutrality of the article.

5. **Constructive Debate**: The dialogue is constructive, with each participant building on the others' points and suggesting rewrites or clarifications. There is a clear effort to reach a consensus that balances factual accuracy with readability for the general audience.

6. **Focus on Reader Comprehension**: There is a concern for how the information will be received by readers, with an emphasis on not overwhelming them with jargon or unnecessary details. The discussants are aware that the average reader may not have a background in electrical engineering.

7. **Acknowledgment of Misconceptions**: The discussants acknowledge common misconceptions about Tesla and AC, showing an awareness of the broader context in which readers might approach the article.

8. **Willingness to Compromise**: There is a willingness to compromise and find middle ground, as seen in the discussion about how to present Tesla's role in the development of AC without overstating his contributions.

9. **Civility**: The discussion remains civil, even when disagreements arise. Participants express frustration but do not resort to personal attacks, maintaining a professional tone throughout.

10. **Intent to Improve the Article**: The overarching goal of the discussion is to improve the quality of the article, with each participant bringing forward suggestions and corrections to ensure the content is accurate and informative.

Overall, the discussion is characterized by a high level of engagement, respect for Wikipedia's standards, and a collaborative effort to enhance the article's quality. The participants use evidence-based arguments and are mindful of the reader's experience, which are hallmarks of a productive and high-quality discussion.

"<user_id=Three-quarter-ten>
From a linguistic science point of view, ""thou"" is a lexical item; it's a ""real word"" all right, although derived from a longer word by truncation. For those who oppose ""thou"" as a pagename, if you really started combing through etymologies of English-language words, I'd bet you could find many common words that came from such truncation that no longer have any registers where they ""dare not tread"". The idea that this process of linguistic evolution and expansion across registers must be stopped for propriety's sake bucks the realities of natural language. I agree that per WP:COMMONNAME, it's fine to keep the title as-is, and is actually preferable. A closer analogy would be if the article ""physical examination"" were called ""physical exam"". Physicians say ""exam"" or ""lab"" in speech much more often than they say ""examination"" or ""laboratory""; and it's a certain hyperactive (although prevalent) kind of prescriptivism that insists that those words must never be written when the longer form could be substituted. The more common usage is not as horrid as a schoolmarm would have us believe. Her sense of how language works doesn't match linguistic reality. The comparison to ""Dubya"" is really a red herring. It speciously appeals as analogous on the surface, but it's a different subclass of the phenomenon (not least because names of persons are not precisely just like all other words in the way they're used and interchanged), and it serves as an exaggerated example that ends up being a straw man. Not saying that happens intentionally—just that the assumed equivalence is speciously appealing. — 

<user_id=Badon>
This article is an artifact of Wikipedia. It does not exist in the real world. Nobody writes ""thou"" (maybe you can find some irrelevant rare exceptions). Instead, it is always written numerically, or with the word ""mil"". Look to the plastic sheeting industry for examples. This article is an abomination and should be deleted, redirected, or renamed.

<user_id=Badon>
I added dispute and citation needed templates. There are billions, if not trillions of works that use thousandths of an inch in the form of mils or just plain numbers. You could probably count on one hand the number of works that use the spelled-out literal verbal ""thou"". Nobody is ever going to be able to satisfactorily cite that ""thou"" is a unit, and ""mil"" is just another way of saying ""thou"". It's 100% total BS.
Mils and numerical forms have been used for as long as metrics capability has been able to reach that level of accuracy (probably since at least the 19th century). The most prominent usage of ""thou"" is only in this Wikipedia article. I dare you to try to find works using the word ""thou"" that predate this article. You get bonus points if you can find one that's older than Wikipedia. You don't even have to find cites to support the assertions of the article (they don't exist in significant numbers).

About 90 seconds on google brought my to Popular Science Oct 1963, page 220: http://books.google.com.au/books?id=niADAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PA220&q;=thou&f;=false#v=snippet&q;=thou&f;=false It took 90 seconds because I had to spend time to filter out Shakespearean thee, thy, thou. How do I claim my bonus? On the Australia car scene up to at least the 1980s, every mechanic would talk about overboring an engine by 30 thou, shaving 50 thou off the head or gaping the spark plugs by so many thou. Of course it's an abbreviation for thousands of an inch but it was used as a unit by practically every Australian mechanic and rev-head. Until I read it on Wikipedia, I had never even heard of 'mil'. Is 'mil' an official unit? To me it looks like another abbreviation of thousandth of an inch except it uses the romance root instead of the Germanic root. Which would make both 'thou' and 'mil' slang. Except that 'thou' is far more popular than 'mil' (at least in automotive circles). And 'mil' is going out of fashion because of confusion with millimeter.   

<user_id=Three-quarter-ten>
Badon, the mistake you're making is believing that Wikipedia only covers topics whose names are used in written registers. That's an assumption you're making, not an indisputable fact. Machinists *SAY* the word ""thou"" all day long, every day. That alone is why we are ""allowed"" to say it on Wikipedia. — 

<user_id=Three-quarter-ten>
By the way, nothing in this article, either now or before the recent edits, is or was incorrect. It's all correct. The overblown use of {cn} tags can stay, because yes it will be nice to take the time to find refs to cite, but your adding them with the tone that you think the information is wrong just exposes your own ignorance. If you were a machinist in a commercial machining environment in either the US or Australia or Britain, you wouldn't think this article is an ""abomination"" or whatever other silly hyperbolic adjective you might apply. This article exists in Wikipedia because it ACCURATELY covers the subject of what a thousandth of an inch is, and how machinists talk about it. So you're absolutely 100% wrong that ""This article is an artifact of Wikipedia. It does not exist in the real world."" Like I said above, just because the short form ""thou"" is seldom *written* doesn't have anything to do with the fact that machinists *say* it every day. — 

<user_id=Uruiamme>
Badon, the diverse ways which you are condemning this article smacks of trolling. As 3/4-10 points out, the article (faults and all) discusses the mil and thou in such a way as to make it clear that this is one of the many hundreds of units of measure that were developed before the ubiquity of the Metric system. If engineers in the 19th century '''DID NOT USE THE THOU''', then what in the world did they use? Do you propose that this article is mythology and should be deleted and yet at the same time you want it to move elsewhere? You find it so weird that ""thou"" and ""mil"" are equated when they seem like only semantic differences to those who use them? You know, some people find out new information on Wikipedia. Now that I attacked your methods, let me attack your sense of logic.

<user_id=Uruiamme>
Suppose that at least one person in the '''WORLD''' had a mnemonic or abbreviated way of pronouncing the following:
0.036 inch
Suppose that this person did not toe the line and say ""36 thousandths of an inch"" or ""36 mil."" Suppose he was unlearned, or his sense of abbreviation had gone wacko when he was dropped on his head when he was a child slaving inside a grimy engine factory in Detroit or in the Outback of Australia. And he alone said aloud, '''''36 THOU'''''. My question to you is this: Would his co-workers (a) laugh, (b) cry, (c) understand him and admonish him not to be linguistically lazy, (d) start using the same abbreviation.

<user_id=Badon>
I am a machinist (and more). A darn good one too. I have done a bit of everything: medical, aerospace, tool and die, light industrial, heavy industrial, mining, oil, military, automotive, plastics, composites, ferrous, non-ferrous, metallic, non-metallic, hazardous, non-hazardous, robotic/CNC, manual, Japanese, American, German, Swiss, English, metric, modern, antique, chemical, biological, nuclear, etc, etc. Some of the things my teams have built are on Mars right now. Other bits are flitting around parts of the universe I can't even imagine. But, none of that is important.
What is important is ""thou"" is not the name for the unit of length equal to .001 inch. It is a verbal abbreviation for the word ""thousandth"", and NOTHING MORE. Yes, everyone in industry who uses any thousandth of any unit will say the word ""thou"" as a matter of expediency. Yes, we say ""thou"" even when talking about .001 millimeters. Things like that are the reason the Mars Climate Orbiter crashed. For inches, the unit name is ""Mil"". Anything else is supplementary to that, not vice-versa.
I have seen ungodly quantities of blueprints and technical documents, in more languages than I can identify. Not one of them has the word ""thou"" on it. Many of them have the word ""mil"", though. That includes blueprints originating from Europe, China, or some other part of the world. In total, I will make a wild guess that there are at least 1 trillion written works that do NOT use the word ""thou"". The word ""thou"" is specious, and it's non-verbal usage is also specious. If it deserves an article, then it is on the same level as ain't. I don't think ""thou"" deserves its own article, but I see nothing wrong with making one.
What I am opposed to is supplanting formal ""Mil"" with informal ""thou"". It makes no sense. It would be equally stupid in any culture, and any language. You don't push aside technical specificity for vague colloquialisms. Somebody tried that once with something important, and it's now twisted up in it's own little crater on Mars. Maybe you should call that guy up ask him how his career is doing, to get an idea of how ridiculous such things are.
Mil is the correct name for the unit of length equal to .001 inch. ""thou"" is a verbal slang abbreviation for the word ""thousand(th)(s)"". That's all there is to it.

<user_id=Stepho-wrs>
I will make a wild guess that there are at least 1 trillion written works that do NOT use the word ""NASA"". Is there a point?
As for confusing ""thou"" for thousandth of a millimetre, I'd say that confusing confusing ""mil"" with millimetre is far more likely in this era of metric use. But that's off topic - we live with what the real world throws at us.

<user_id=Stepho-wrs>
Please provide a reference for the formal definition of 'mil'. Otherwise we have to put ''both'' ""mil"" and ""thou"" on an informal footing. If you can give a formal reference then the discussion is over and we can go back to being productive.   

<user_id=Badon>
Google produces 29 million results for the definition of ""mil"". Take your pick: https://www.google.com/search?q=mil+definition

<user_id=Badon>
And yes, there is a point (you completely missed it). 1 trillion written works where the subject is measurements in mil units is pretty conspicuous if not one of them uses the word ""thou"". It doesn't get any more definitive than that. Seriously, how could it be more definitive? If out of 1 trillion definitive works you can find maybe 20 questionably notable ones that say ""thou"", what kind of insanity does it take to decide the 20 is more important than the trillion? It makes no sense!

<user_id=Uruiamme>
''Ok, Badon, Me TOO!''' I think that if it was up to me, the article would be titled ""Mil"" or ""Mil (unit)"" or something and the article would use the ''mil'' for most of its language. I don't see anything horribly wrong with keeping it the way it is, but I would prefer that mil predominate. Now, what about you? Could you tolerate some or very many ''thou''s in the article? Obviously your threshold for pain was quite low on this one, so please elaborate. I am afraid some folks from UKoGBaNI and the Commonwealth states might have a '''low tolerance''' (pun intended) for instances of the ''mil''. I think in the overall scheme of things that the ''thou'' is too heavily used for my tastes, but it hasn't aggrieved me.

<user_id=Stepho-wrs>
Badon.
Yes, I saw your point but its hard to take it seriously when you go off into hyperbole and wild exaggeration. These supposed 1 trillion written works prove very little. I could find plenty of works that mention ""thou"" and do not mention ""mil"". Advantage neither side.

<user_id=Stepho-wrs>
As mentioned in the article, some fields of work naturally use ""mil"" (the article mentions thin plastics, a field in which I am not familiar) and other fields naturally use ""thou"" (eg automotive, of which I am quite familiar). Advantage neither side.
You anecdotally mentioned that you have seen many works with ""mil"" and none in ""thou"". I counted this with my own anecdote of many works with ""thou"" and none in ""mil"". Advantage neither side.
Uruiamme might have something in it being an American vs Commonwealth thing (I'm Australian but have worked in many countries). If it is an American vs Commonwealth thing then WP:ENGVAR says that both forms are valid but that we should not change the title unless there is clear consensus.  See Talk:Aluminium/Spelling and the history of Aluminium if you want to see a full fledged war based on cultural usage. Advantage neither side.
Your google search doesn't produce much that usable. I checked the first few pages and they were mostly sites like www.answer.com - not exactly first class references. I'm not going to do your work for you by wading through thousands of links. However, your search did produce http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mil but that's an American dictionary and I'm not sure whether a dictionary counts as an official definition. If dictionaries count then http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/thou makes the same claim for ""thou"". Here's the correspond google search for ""thou"" https://www.google.com/search?q=thou+definition+inch which produces sites with a similar lack of quality as your search. You still haven't provided an ''official'' body that defines ""mil"" as an official unit. Advantage neither side.
So far it looks like two informal units used in different fields and possibly different cultures.   

<user_id=Badon>
I have run out of time for addressing all of your points, some of which I disagree with still. The one thing I partly agree with is the largely informal nature of both ""mil"" and ""thou"". However, the definition for ""mil"" is unambiguous, while ""thou"" is just slang for ""thousand(th)(s)"". There's a reason we don't call the kilogram a ""kilo"".
Kilo is in far more common usage in verbal language than ""kilogram"", but it is just ambiguous slang, and not suitable for being presented as anything else. ""Kg"" is also just an abbreviation, and not suitable for an article title even though it is both standardized, and in far more common usage in written works than either ""kilogram"" or ""kilo"". ""Kg"" and ""kilo"" both take second place to the unambiguous ""kilogram"", simply because they're merely alternative forms for ""kilogram"".

<user_id=Badon>
Another proposal is to rename the article to ""Thousandth of an inch"". Then we can discuss ""mil"" and ""thou"" on equal footing, and I don't think there's any disagreement about that. What do you think?

<user_id=Stepho-wrs>
Good, we at least agree that both forms are informal. I'm still confused about a couple of your points. If 'thou' is dismissed as just an abbreviation of thousandth then why is 'mil' okay when it is just an abbreviation of 'mille' (Latin for thousandth)? And if 'thou' is dismissed because of potential confusion between thousandths of an inch and thousandths of some other unit then why is 'mil' okay when it can be confused with mm (common in metric countries to say 5 mm as '5 mil')?

<user_id=Stepho-wrs>
The article concerns the expression used. People tend to type in the expression rather than the formal concept. My preferences for the article name would be 'Thou' (first), 'Mil' (second), 'Thousandth of an inch' (very distant third).   

<user_id=Badon>
Redirects can handle whatever people are likely to type in. I concede that ""mil"" and ""thou"" are on equal footing beneath ""Thousandth of an inch"", for the purposes of this article. If we are moving towards Thousandth of an inch as the proper title for this article, then we can present the full spectrum of usage of numerical forms, ""mil"", ""thou"", and whatever else is notable, all within an unambiguous context of ""Thousandth of an inch"".

<user_id=Badon>
I disagree that the article concerns solely the expression ""thou"". Firstly, given its nature as a trivial abbreviation of the word ""thousand(th)(s)"", it is either ambiguously meaningless or not sufficiently notable for Wikipedia, separately from the full context of ""Thousandth of an inch"". ""Mil"" seems to be in a similar situation. Therefore, information about the unit of length meaning for both ""mil"" and ""thou"" naturally belongs in an article about ""Thousandth of an inch"". I learned a few things just fleshing this issue out here on the talk page - like ""mil"" is not so well-defined as I had thought, which makes it perhaps literally equivalent to ""thou"" as yet another informal abbreviation of an ambiguous word (although the choice of a Latin word was undoubtedly meant to avoid ambiguity and trivialness, much like Latin and Greek scientific naming schemes - a feature that ""thou"" does not have).

<user_id=Badon>
So, in terms of raw usefulness, I think a properly contextualized article explaining all of this would be very good for anyone looking for the information. I'm a pretty knowledgeable fellow, particularly in this area of specialty, so the fact that I didn't know some of this information is a testament to the importance of getting this article right here on Wikipedia.

<user_id=Stepho-wrs>
Yeah, I know the feeling of finding out a belief of 20 years was wrong (see my folly at Talk:Parallel_ATA#Removed Master/Slave Controversy).

<user_id=Stepho-wrs>
I much prefer 'thou' due to my own biases and could live with 'mil' in recognition of other people's biases (as agreed by both of us, both forms are on an equal footing). I'm not thrilled with moving to 'Thousandth of an inch' because nobody says that but I'm not seriously against it either. And as you said, redirects can cover all forms. Give me a few days to let it rattle around my subconscious a bit - like wine, sometimes a bit of aging brings out the fine points )    

<user_id=Badon>
Sounds good, I'll kick back and visit this talk page again in a few days. Wost Wikipedians are lifelong-learners, so I'm sure we'll recover after we integrate this ""new"" paradigm into our subconscious ) If it's any consolation, America will probably switch to the metric system after we finally figure out exactly what to call this unit we've been using for the last 200 years, and then it will be just a historical curiosity...

<user_id=Badon>
It has been a over a month since there has been any discussion of disagreement about renaming this article to Thousandth of an inch. This is a last call for further discussion, and if there's no response or no disagreement, then myself or someone else can do the move and adjust the phrasing in the article to accommodate it.

<user_id=Stepho-wrs>
Oops, I'd forgotten about this. I'm still not thrilled about the proposed name but I'll not stand in it's way. Don't forget to make 'thou' and 'mil' redirect to the new name and to mention them both prominently in the introduction.   

<user_id=Three-quarter-ten>
''Support'''. I'm not against the current title, but I'm equally OK with the change as described above (title thousandth of an inch, all redirects point to there, make sure to keep all discussion of nomenclature and usage). I think I'll go move the page now, and tweak the lede accordingly. — 

<user_id=Badon>
I like the work you hove done for the move, thank you very much!

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Argument about linguistic evolution and usage**: User Three-quarter-ten presents a well-reasoned argument about the natural evolution of language and how truncation of words is a common process in English. They argue that ""thou"" is used in spoken language among machinists and therefore has a place on Wikipedia. This argument is coherent and relevant to the discussion about the page name.

2. **Argument about real-world usage**: User Badon argues that ""thou"" is not commonly used in written form and that ""mil"" or numerical representations are standard in technical documents. They assert that the article should reflect common written usage. This argument is factually accurate and relevant, although it may not fully consider spoken usage in certain industries.

3. **Evidence of historical usage**: User Stepho-wrs provides evidence from a 1963 Popular Science magazine using ""thou,"" which supports the argument that ""thou"" has historical usage. This is a factual and relevant point that adds to the discussion about the term's validity.

4. **Discussion of Wikipedia's scope**: User Three-quarter-ten points out that Wikipedia covers topics that are used in spoken language, not just written language, which is a valid point about the inclusivity of Wikipedia's content.

5. **Argument about formal vs. informal usage**: User Badon insists on the formal use of ""mil"" over the informal ""thou,"" drawing parallels to other units of measurement. This argument is coherent and emphasizes the importance of precision in technical contexts.

6. **Cultural and field-specific usage**: User Stepho-wrs and Uruiamme mention that ""thou"" is commonly used in automotive and other fields, particularly in the Commonwealth, which is a relevant point about the diversity of usage across different regions and industries.

7. **Proposal for compromise**: User Badon suggests renaming the article to ""Thousandth of an inch"" to avoid the controversy between ""mil"" and ""thou."" This is a constructive proposal that seeks to find common ground.

8. **Consensus and action**: The discussion moves towards a consensus with the proposal to rename the article, and User Three-quarter-ten supports the move and takes action to implement it. This shows a resolution and collaborative effort to improve the article.

Overall, the discussion is characterized by a mix of well-reasoned arguments, factual evidence, and a willingness to find a compromise. The participants engage in a constructive debate, considering both linguistic and technical perspectives. The dialogue moves towards a resolution that seems to satisfy the main concerns of the participants.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.5",8.5

JAH Throne music

<user_id=Gaaarg>
The article intro currently includes this line: ""The music style is sometimes referred to as '''JAH Throne music''' in Rastafari contexts. In the Caribbean, the heavier forms of reggae are also sometimes known as '''Rockers music'''.""
I've never heard reggae being referred to as ""JAH Throne music"", and a quick Google search reveals only 451 hits. Rockers refers to a ""sound"" or a sub-genre that was popular in the later 70s in Jamaica, but it is not something that merits a mention in the introduction of a whole music genre. If no one objects, I'm going to remove it.

<user_id=Til Eulenspiegel>
So, now you're deleting information on the basis that there are 451 google hits, and you've never heard of it?  Gee, if there are only 451 google hits and you've never heard of it, I guess that means it must not really exist then, right?  Sorry, but I DO object, especially part of what you deleted included a reference.  This ref was not always in the intro and might not need to be there, but please do not undo the hard work others have done in complying with all the references and citations requests, just because in your perception of experience you are not familiar with something.  Thankyou.

<user_id=Migglesworth>
I am going to go with Gaaarg on this one.  This page is intended to be a general introduction to reggae.  I do not feel that having the term JAH THRONE (although it may be a perfectly valid term in reggae), in the page would lead folks in the right direction.  I think we should keep it out for now.  With all due respect, please post your motivation for including this term along with the term ""rockers"".  Regarding the comment on citations and the amount of work involved, sometimes it is hard work conforming to the standards of this encyclopedia and sometimes it gets erased outright.  Just because something is difficult doesn't give it precedence to stay in the page.  After your motivation is posted and it seems that the page would be lacking without term JAH THRONE, then it should be reinstated.

<user_id=Til Eulenspiegel>
The info that was Reliably Sourced should not have ben blanked just because some have a low opinion of it.  There has to be a very good reason for blanking out information from Reliable Sources, and ""because I / we don't think it's important"" usually doesn't cut it, being of course a POV.   You are free to look for contradictory references if there are any, but do not blank the ones that are there.  This is an encyclopedia that aims to be comprehensive, so we are trying to include MORE reliable information about the subject, not less.

<user_id=Gaaarg>
I've looked a bit for sources that would say reggae music is known as ""JAH Throne music"" and I can't find any. The term is not mentioned in the introductory chapter of ''The Rough Guide to Reggae'' (3rd edition), and it's not in the index. Personally, I can't recall seeing it used anywhere and I've read several books on reggae. Unless someone can dig up a reliable source, it should be removed.

<user_id=Gaaarg>
Regarding the rockers part; the source that is used does in fact not state that ""in the Caribbean, the heavier forms of reggae are also sometimes known as Rockers music"" or anything to that effect IMO. ""In rockers, the bass was as heavily amplified as ever and continued to provide the basic background throb—reggae's heartbeat. [...] In some types of heavy reggae (especially in instrumental or ""dub"" music) the bass takes over the prominent role [...]"" (''Cut 'n' Mix: Culture, Identity and Caribbean Music'' p.67). Nothing in that text about ""rockers"" being a term used in the Caribbean (as in, outside Jamaica), and the heavy part seems to be mostly about dub music. —

<user_id=Til Eulenspiegel>
So, I take it that since you can't find it on Google, therefore you do not believe this is true, and think that someone made it up out of thin air just to confuse you...?

<user_id=Gaaarg>
That's not really what I said in my message above... -) Anyways, see WP:VERIFY: ""Editors should provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is challenged or is likely to be challenged, or the material may be removed."". —

<user_id=Til Eulenspiegel>
And this is why wikipedia has the reputation it has, because of armchair experts who delete anything they can't find on google.

<user_id=Gaaarg>
I don't know why you keep assuming Google is my only source. I gave you another source above, but here's more   . I just think it stands to reason that since several books on the subject reggae don't mention the term, it's simply not in common use and hence not notable enough to be mentioned in this article; and I know Google ""hit counts"" aren't a reliable source, but it can give at least a little indication of if something is used often or not. Have you seen ""JAH Throne music"" used anywhere? Don't feel like I'm attacking you, I just think the information is false, and shouldn't be included in Wikipedia. —

<user_id=Til Eulenspiegel>
Maybe if you had ever spent time in the Caribbean, you wouldn't think this ""information is false"".  But now, thanks to Google, anyone from anywhere in the world can find 400 hits for a phrase and claim to be an expert from their armchair and say therefore it doesn't exist and that somebody made it up.  Guess ya gotta love 'em.

<user_id=Migglesworth>
Oh man.  Still there, still in BOLD for some reason.  The same logic used to insult armchair experts can be used to infer that just because someone has lived in the Caribbean and heard the term JAH THRONE in reference to reggae from 400 people, doesn't make them an expert on reggae either.  Like Gaarg said, there is no attacking just trying to get the most reliable and well known facts together.Is this an edit war?  If so this is my first.  I don't like the feeling.

<user_id=Cziltang Brone>
I've deleted the sentence in question. The use of this ""JAH Throne"" should not be included, much less in bold (sheesh!), unless specific citation can be given for it. The burden of evidence is on those wanting to '''include''' the term, not those asking for it to be removed. This is basic people. You have to prove something ''exists'', not prove its ''non-existence''. I will stand by this edit.

<user_id=Migglesworth>
One more thing.  Rockers music.  I understand that it is cited and all that.  It is in the wrong place.  One recommendation would be to create a section for other names of reggae across the world.  That would give a good opportunity to include rockers and many other names like ""boom-boom music"" and the locations they come from like ""Jeret's parents house"".  Joking aside, seriously, if you want something in there like other names for reggae across the world, create the category and add it to it.  Don't just shove it in the second introductory paragraph.

<user_id=Cziltang Brone>
I agree with  on this. The introductory paragraph should be just that  introductory. It should be of a summary nature for a topic as broad as Reggae. It is not appropriate to include synonyms or culturally/geographically equivalent terms.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Gaaarg's Argument**: Gaaarg's initial argument is based on the lack of widespread recognition of the term ""JAH Throne music"" and the absence of this term in reliable sources such as ""The Rough Guide to Reggae"". Gaaarg also points out that the term ""Rockers music"" is not accurately represented in the source provided. This argument is based on the principles of verifiability and notability, which are important in Wikipedia's content guidelines.

2. **Til Eulenspiegel's Argument**: Til Eulenspiegel's counter-argument is that the term was reliably sourced and should not be removed simply because some editors are not familiar with it. This argument emphasizes the importance of maintaining information that has been sourced reliably, regardless of its popularity or the familiarity of the editors.

3. **Migglesworth's Argument**: Migglesworth supports Gaaarg's position, suggesting that the term ""JAH Throne music"" may not be the best fit for a general introduction to reggae and that the term ""rockers"" is misplaced in the introduction. Migglesworth also points out that difficulty in adding content does not justify its inclusion if it does not meet Wikipedia's standards.

4. **Cziltang Brone's Argument**: Cziltang Brone reinforces the point that the burden of evidence is on those who wish to include specific terms, and that without proper citation, the term should not be included. This argument aligns with Wikipedia's verification policy.

5. **Discussion of Expertise and Experience**: There is a back-and-forth about expertise and experience, with Til Eulenspiegel suggesting that personal experience in the Caribbean validates the term's use, while Gaaarg and Migglesworth argue for the importance of verifiable and widely recognized sources over anecdotal evidence.

6. **Proposal for a Separate Section**: Migglesworth proposes a constructive solution by suggesting the creation of a separate section for other names of reggae across the world, which would be a more appropriate place for terms like ""JAH Throne music"" and ""Rockers music"".

Overall, the discussion shows a mix of adherence to Wikipedia's content policies and personal experiences. The arguments that focus on verifiability, notability, and the proper placement of content within the article are strong and align with Wikipedia's guidelines. The arguments that rely on personal experience or the existence of a single source without broader recognition are weaker in the context of Wikipedia's standards for inclusion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

OK, time to start a new number! Trying to take into account the talk above, and being a glutton for punishment, I offer version '''12'''. What I've tried to do is to take into account what people did and did not like about '''11d''' and '''radical-b''', and combine them:

Suggestion: ""Atheism is '''disbelief or lack of belief''' in...""

<user_id=Born2cycle>
Bravo!

<user_id=JimWae>
1> As I have commented many times before: ""lack"" implies a deficiency 2>This construction has wikipedia take a position that the absence definition is a good ""definition"" of atheism. Doing so would violate WP:NPOV. Accordingly, per WP:BRD, I will be reverting your edit to the earlier one that I also dislike.

<user_id=Cybercobra>
By implication, you're saying the absence definition is a bad ""definition"" of atheism, which is equally POV. At any rate, these threads have gotten so convoluted that I'll admit I've lost track of exactly what beefs people had with the original lede. There seems to be quite a lot of bikeshedding going on.

<user_id=Cybercobra>
Ah, right, the ""dictionary-ness"". The point of this new draft is to try and summarize the three definitions in a pithy way, succinctly, and in a single sentence; and then present the 3 more detailed definitions directly thereafter.

<user_id=JimWae>
It is not just my opinion that the absence def is deficient as a def. Nagel explicitly opposes it, and Dawkins implicitly - even the source we use says it is less rigorous (there are other reasons why that source was used - so don't change the source). Numerous other sources also oppose the absence def. I am not advocating that we say it is substandard, but the construction you reverted to endorses it. WP:BRD advises against the revert you made before further discussion has taken place - and when the issue is the WP:NPOV policy, lots of discussion is needed. The fix is to say ""Atheism ''has been defined as''..."" (a1 & a2 & a3).

<user_id=Cybercobra>
That's not gonna fly. The ""that sounds like a dictionary"" contingent won't have it. (Not that I'm part of said contingent).

<user_id=JimWae>
According to all responses to the RFC I started at the talk page for WP:NAD, there is no problem in saying ""A has been defined as...""(a1 and a2 and a3). So the concern about ""sounds like a dictionary"" is just a local style sentiment (or just a misinterpretation of WP:NAD) - not a style guideline issue. Policy issues - especially NPOV policy - override local style sentiments (and even style guideline issues).

<user_id=JimWae>
It is also POV to say ""'''Atheism''' ''is'' the position that there are no deities"" as there are 3 defs and no agreement that any one of them is what atheism ""really is"".

<user_id=Windyhead>
Agree, feel free to revert to consensus lead

<user_id=JimWae>
I'd rather you used one of your reverts for that. I've already reverted today, 1.7 times)

<user_id=Born2cycle>
I apologize if I missed it, but I see no objection above to this version (thanks to CyberCobra for wordsmithing this one):

<user_id=Born2cycle>
Atheism is disbelief or absence of belief in the existence of deities, including the position that there are no deities,[1] the rejection of belief in the existence of deities,[2] or simply the absence of belief that any deities exist.[3]
However, it was reverted twice, once without explanation, and a second time with the ""no consensus"" non-objection.  In fact, this is a wording that has addressed all stated concerns on this talk page, which is quite the feat.  So, I've restored it.  Please, if you have an objection to any wording, make it specific on the talk page.  Thanks.

<user_id=Born2cycle>
And I understand that there are objections to the ""absence of belief"" definition, however, it is a definition used in reliable sources, and is clearly qualified with ''or'', making clear it is not the only definition used in reliable sources.  Disbelief is listed first, making clear that is no way is the absence being endorsed as ''the'' definition (a much more valid objection made earlier to saying simply ""Atheism is nonbelief in ..."").

<user_id=Tryptofish>
I think ""disbelief or absence of belief"" is good, and arguably better than ""unbelief or disbelief"", although I don't think there's a big difference. I think ""lack of"" is a problem. And I think edit warring instead of discussing here is a bigger problem. Shall I, once again, request full protection?

<user_id=Tryptofish>
By the way, deity is now blue-linked three times in the one sentence.

<user_id=Born2cycle>
Wikipedia is not improved by tolerance for reverts made without explanation, include reverts made with pseudo objections like ""insufficient discussion"" or ""no consensus"".  Especially considering all the work going into this, people should at least have the decency to clearly explain their actual objection (if any) to a given version before reverting it, if they revert it at all.  Anything but reverting such a revert amounts to tolerance of such behavior, and is not good for Wikipedia.

<user_id=Born2cycle>

<user_id=Born2cycle>
T, I agree with your comments about content.

<user_id=Cybercobra>

<user_id=Tryptofish>
Thank you, but: ''Gripes about the links'': it used to be useful, and consensus, to have links to God and gods somewhere in the lead. And the theism thing, although well-intentioned, has the effect of seeming to say that theism is an example of existence of God.

<user_id=Tryptofish>
And while I'm at it (griping), I think the claim that the lead is POV is nonsense.

<user_id=Born2cycle>
Regardless of whether it is nonsense, what I don't see is an explanation from Jim (who marked it as violation NPOV) or anyone else about why he or anyone else believes it to be a violation of NPOV.  Without such explanation, the tag needs to be removed.

When I suggested ""disbelief or unbelief"", I thought the form of words had the advantage of being ambiguous, so that the next sentence could set out our three main typological traditions and we didn't need to get bogged down in POV issues with the very first sentence.  It is not clear to me that ""absence of belief"" is not tolerably contained in the dictionary definitions of either ""disbelief"" or ""unbelief"".  The proposal mentions ""absence"" in the next sentence, so to mention it in the very first sentence seems to give it more weight as compared with anything else.   I would be interested in reading why people think ""absence"" ought to appear up front.

<user_id=Tryptofish>
You make some good points there. Putting ""absence"" up front makes it a repetition of what comes so soon after in ""definition 3"". What you refer to as ambiguity can also be regarded as generality and inclusiveness. And, on a separate point, I want to observe that there has been insufficient discussion of the changes to the blue links in the lead.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The participants are discussing the definition of atheism for a Wikipedia article, which is a complex and nuanced topic. The discussion involves various interpretations of what atheism entails and how it should be presented in an encyclopedic context.

2. User Cybercobra suggests a definition that includes ""disbelief or lack of belief,"" which is met with approval by User Born2cycle but is challenged by User JimWae on the grounds of neutrality and adherence to Wikipedia's NPOV (Neutral Point of View) policy.

3. User JimWae argues that the phrase ""lack of belief"" implies a deficiency and that the proposed definition takes a stance on what atheism is, which could violate NPOV. JimWae suggests an alternative phrasing that avoids endorsing a particular definition.

4. User Cybercobra counters by saying that avoiding the ""absence definition"" could be seen as equally biased. Cybercobra also addresses concerns about the definition sounding too much like a dictionary, which some users have raised.

5. User JimWae cites responses to an RFC (Request for Comments) to support the use of ""has been defined as"" to avoid POV issues, indicating a willingness to find a solution that adheres to Wikipedia's guidelines.

6. User Windyhead agrees with JimWae's concerns about POV and suggests reverting to a consensus lead.

7. User Born2cycle defends the inclusion of the ""absence of belief"" definition, stating that it is used in reliable sources and is qualified with ""or,"" indicating that it is not the only definition.

8. User Tryptofish brings up concerns about edit warring and suggests requesting full protection to prevent further conflicts. Tryptofish also notes an issue with overlinking in the sentence.

9. User Dannyno suggests that the phrase ""disbelief or unbelief"" might be preferable due to its ambiguity, allowing for a more inclusive and less contentious first sentence.

10. Throughout the discussion, participants are generally respectful and provide reasons for their positions. They reference Wikipedia policies and guidelines, such as NPOV and BRD (Bold, Revert, Discuss), and they show a willingness to engage in dialogue to reach a consensus.

Overall, the discussion is characterized by a high level of engagement with the topic, consideration of Wikipedia's policies, and attempts to reconcile different viewpoints. The participants use logical reasoning and cite relevant guidelines to support their arguments. However, there is some repetition of points and a need for further clarification on certain issues, such as the weight given to different definitions and the handling of links in the lead.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Recreational drugs

<user_id=72Dino>
This may seem like a small item, but it's important and I don't want to edit war over it.  I do not see where Focus on the Family uses the term ""recreational drugs"".  There is nothing recreational about illegal drug use or abuse of legal drugs.  It diminishes the seriousness of the issue and is not the term used among organizations like this.  I think ""drug abuse"" is basically what the organization is against and that is the terminology I propose.

<user_id=StillStanding-247>
I don't think that anyone supports drug ''abuse''. As I explained, legality really isn't the issue, since the question is often ''whether'' it should be legal, and FotF opposes these drugs even when they are legal. The term ""recreational drugs"" is meant to be neutral, not lighthearted. It refers to drugs used for non-medical purposes. Take a look a Recreational drug use and you'll see.

<user_id=72Dino>
I have read the article.  If you can show me where Focus on the Family uses the term, I will concede.  Otherwise, recreational drug use = drug abuse for most religious organizations, and drug abuse is, in my opinion, a more correct term.

<user_id=Belchfire>
Gotta go with the best available source on this one.  FotF says ""drug abuse"".  Somebody who wants to show that FotF (or any Christian organization) draws a distinction between legal and illegal, has their work cut out for them.  ALL use of intoxicants is seen as ""drug abuse"".  There is no ""recreational"" use that fits their principles.  -

<user_id=StillStanding-247>
Even if FotF is convinced that all recreational drug use is drug abuse, that doesn't mean we get to endorse that view. Drug abuse is, by definition, negative. The people who want to legalize marijuana (and this appears to be a clear majority of the USA) would never say they support drug abuse. But it's clear that they support recreational drugs, which makes it a neutral term. To be quite frank, I just don't see a better way of expressing it.

<user_id=72Dino>
The FOTF did not say they were against ""recreational drug use"", they are against ""drug abuse"" per Belchfire's edit below.  We should use their terminology to describe their position, not the terminology and interpretation of one WP editor.

<user_id=Belchfire>
We should use their terminology.  Now where have I heard that before?  -

<user_id=StillStanding-247>
Thank you again for supporting my argument. What they ''call'' drug abuse is what is neutrally termed recreational drug use.

<user_id=72Dino>
If they state they are against drug abuse, that's what should be put in the article.

<user_id=Belchfire>
I'm sorry, but WP:NPOV prevents us from doing that, as it would require '''Wikipedia''' to agree with their apparent claim that all recreational use is abuse. There is no reliable source for such a thing, which would lead us to violate WP:RS. Really, ""recreation drugs"" is very neutral and supported. I don't see any better alternative.
Consensus is to go with the wording from the source: ""drug abuse""  Case closed.  -
Sorry, but you have no authority to declare any such thing. Instead of listening to you, I'll listen to WP:NPOV and WP:RS. If you don't like it, go complain on the content dispute resolution page. I'm confident your view will be rejected.

<user_id=72Dino>
That is your description rather than that of FOTF.  It is not up to you to interpret their statements of their position.

<user_id=StillStanding-247>
No, it's not my view, it's the view of reliable sources.

<user_id=72Dino>
Change.org is not a reliable source so I didn't bother looking at that.  The Denver Post is an RS, but I see no mention of drugs in that article.

<user_id=Belchfire>
You don't see it because... wait for it... there is no mention of drugs in that article.  He doesn't have a source, he's just engaging in vexation tactics, for what reason, we can only guess.  It's not necessary to trouble yourself - as I pointed out a while ago, we already have consensus and the only reason the article hasn't been updated is that I've already done my share of reversions for the time being.  Ignore the nonsense about ""not having authority"".  -

<user_id=72Dino>
(ec)The Los Angeles Times states the FOTF handles ""problems of chemical substance abuse"", which is also an acceptable term.

<user_id=Belchfire>
I would also be OK with ""substance abuse"", if you feel that is appropriate.  In fact, it might be even better.  Just so we avoid the qualifier ""recreational"", which we both find problematic.  -

<user_id=StillStanding-247>
Same problem: nobody supports ''abuse''.

<user_id=72Dino>
What does it matter if no one supports substance abuse?  Either get rid of it or use the term ""abuse"" as stated by FOTF and by the LA Times.

<user_id=Belchfire>
If that's the remaining counter-argument - that nobody supports substance abuse - then we have a winner, and ""substance abuse"" is our term of choice.  The counter-argument fails ''ab initio'' because MANY people and organizations support the abuse of illegal substances.  -

<user_id=StillStanding-247>
You keep speaking for yourself as if you speak for others. Why?

<user_id=StillStanding-247>
It matters because that makes it a biased description. It's not that FotF opposes abuse, since ''everyone'' does, it's that is opposes recreational use on the non-objective basis that all use is abuse. This means that following their bias would violate WP:NPOV. That's why the LA Times was careful to attribute the drug abuse idea as ""according to Dobson"". Of course, if I were to phrase it as ""what it considers drug abuse"", I fully expect that Belchfire would launch into an edit war against ""weasel words"".

<user_id=72Dino>
It is the description from the organization and a reliable source.  You may not add your own original research and interpretation of the sources.  Either it should be removed or use the term used by those sources.  Do you want yet another DRN on this article?

<user_id=StillStanding-247>
No, actually, it's not. This isn't complicated: there is no RS for FotF being against actual drug abuse. There are many RS for FotF being against recreational drug use on the basis of considering it to be abuse. That's why the LA Times was so careful in its phrasing, and why we must do the same. If you can't handle this and want a DRN, go for it.

<user_id=Lionelt>
The sources presented make a strong case for ""substance abuse"" or similiar. I agree with Belch's and 72Dino's well reasoned argument. –

<user_id=StillStanding-247>
WP:NPOV does not permit use to equate drug use with drug abuse. This is not negotiable.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Terminology Dispute**: The core of the argument is about the terminology used to describe Focus on the Family's (FotF) stance on drug use. One side argues for using the term ""drug abuse,"" as it is the term used by FotF and reported by a reliable source (LA Times). The other side argues for using ""recreational drug use"" as a neutral term that does not carry the negative connotations of ""abuse.""

2. **Neutrality and NPOV**: StillStanding-247 emphasizes Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View (NPOV) policy, arguing that using the term ""drug abuse"" would imply Wikipedia endorses FotF's view that all recreational use is abuse, which would be a biased stance. They argue that ""recreational drug use"" is a more neutral term that does not imply a negative judgment.

3. **Source Interpretation**: 72Dino and Belchfire argue that the term ""drug abuse"" is directly from the source and should be used to accurately reflect FotF's position. They suggest that using any other term would be an interpretation or original research, which is against Wikipedia's guidelines.

4. **Consensus and Policy**: Belchfire claims that there is a consensus to use ""drug abuse,"" while StillStanding-247 disputes this, suggesting that the consensus is not in line with Wikipedia's policies on neutrality and reliable sourcing.

5. **Quality of Arguments**:
   - The argument for using ""drug abuse"" is based on direct terminology from the source and the organization's own language. This is a strong point because it emphasizes accuracy in representation.
   - The argument for using ""recreational drug use"" is based on maintaining neutrality and not endorsing a particular viewpoint. This is also a strong point because it aligns with Wikipedia's NPOV policy.
   - Both sides present valid concerns regarding policy adherence (NPOV, RS, and no original research).
   - The discussion includes references to Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, which is a positive aspect as it shows an attempt to align the debate with the platform's standards.
   - The dialogue, however, becomes less constructive towards the end, with some participants making assertions about the motives and actions of others, which detracts from the overall quality of the discussion.

Overall, the discussion shows a good understanding of Wikipedia's policies and a strong engagement with the subject matter. However, the quality is somewhat diminished by the lack of a constructive resolution and the occasional ad hominem remarks.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.0",7.0

Wording in the lede

<user_id=CJCurrie>
I have restored the long-standing introduction, while also making it clear that not ''all'' pro-Israel media watchdogs use this term. Can others suggest why the long-standing wording should be changed?

<user_id=Jaakobou>
Don't be ridiculous. Find a source to make your change and stop edit warring. Find a source please  you know how to read edit summaries, don't act like you invented the wheel and are not the one introducing a personal opinion into the lead. ''''

<user_id=83.111.100.10>
I agree with CJCurrie. The original lead should be retained absent actual reasons to change it.

<user_id=Jaakobou>
That was not the ""original"" and you require a source to make that change. Whoever you are. ''''

<user_id=CJCurrie>
I see that Jaakobou has implied that I'm using a sockpuppet. My response to this statement, and to his latest revert more generally, can be found here: .

<user_id=Jaakobou>
[S]ome pro-Israeli media watchdog advocates is an incorrect presentation and is also a poor choice of words. You're selecting a sub-group of the far larger group people of those who use the term (e.g. Zionist neocon blogsphere, Elders of Zion, Palestinian Authority, Right wing Israelis, Settlers) and you need a source. That is simple Wikipedia guideline for controversial statements  and this is one of those. Catfish? ''''

<user_id=Jaakobou>
p.s. tell your two alter-egos in the Arab peninsula to stop making reverts for you. Please.

<user_id=CJCurrie>
This is what the source we're using for the lede actually says:
'But pro-Israel media-watchdog advocates have gone further, arguing that the footage is a prime example of what has been dubbed ""Pallywood"" - media manipulation, distortion and outright fraud by the Palestinians (and other Arabs, such as the Reuters photographer caught faking photos during the Second Lebanon War), designed to win the public relations war against Israel.''
Based on this (and other reasons that I've already mentioned), I think it's entirely appropriate for us to indicate that the term is used by pro-Israel media watchdog advocates. I've added the qualifier ""some"" because I don't think it's appropriate for us to indicate that ''all'' pro-Israel media watchdog advocates find this (racist) term appropriate.

<user_id=Jaakobou>
Sonia has made a clear improvement to the initial insertion. Thank you for your efforts! Still, the initial phrasing  ""some pro-Israeli media watchdog advocates""  is still in there and is of poor choice even if we accept a special notability for this group, which I tend not to do. I'm not sure on how sources (i.e. not a single source) notate this issue. As such, I've decided to do the work I asked you to do for your change and have come up with these results in my first 3 sources...
Book by David Pratt (historian) - mentions only professor Richard Landes as the source.
Book by Cindy D. Ness (anthropologist) - does not outline a special group of users. Side note: I like her concise definition (per ""phenomenon of manufacturing documentation about the conflict"", ""staged by local organizations to acquire sympathy and support from the outside world"") better than the current quoted phrasing.
Book by Anna Geifman (historian) - uses the term on her own account.
After this short review I'm even more convinced that introduction of a certain group into the definition is incorrect. Moreso, when the current phrasing suggests the people behind the term represent watchdog organizations and are not free thinking individuals and proper researchers.

<user_id=Jaakobou>
See also:
WP:MOSBEGIN for the concept of opening with a clear definition.
Wikipedia:NOTFORUM#FORUM for understanding why it is of poor form to brand the article's title as 'racist' when that personal perspective is not supported by sources.

<user_id=Jaakobou>
p.s. I can see how the group of 'pro-Israeli media-watchdog' can be used further down, but sources do not support its disproportionate use in the definition.

<user_id=CJCurrie>
Jaakobou, of the three sources you've identified, two simply make use of Richard Landes's work (Ness's book has a link to Landes's film), while the third is from a ""terrorism expert"" based in Israel whose doctoral thesis was supervised by Daniel Pipes. Beyond which, I don't think that looking for works that make passing reference to the term is the best way to find acceptable wording for the introduction.

<user_id=CJCurrie>
Incidentally, you'll note that I haven't branded the term as racist in the article space.

<user_id=Jaakobou>
Whether we like it or not, all three are valid wiki-sources and were only presented to strengthen my belief that pointing out a single group in the definition itself is a poor choice that goes against policy. Best I am aware, the only notable person/origin/user for the term is  as was already presented in the article  Richard Landes. I'm open to a wider review of sources that support the alleged notability of the group you wish to insert in the definition but we can't define the term in accordance to your personal preference when there is no foundation to define it in this manner. I am not against mention of this group later down, but they cannot be singled out like this in the definition, even with the thoughtful rephrase attempt. If you want this to remain you must show some definition related notability through sources. This was my initial request to you and after doing a shallow source-hunting (first viable 3 sources I found) my initial perspective was only strenghtened that you were incorrect in this instance.

<user_id=Jaakobou>
p.s. Wikipedia:NOTFORUM#FORUM helps us avoid soapboxing from either side of the political spectrum which, in turn, helps promote collaboration and better articles.

<user_id=CJCurrie>
Jaakobou, this is Wikilawyering. There are only a limited number of credible sources that use this term ''at all''; the fact that you've found a few sources that use the term in passing does nothing to change the fact that it's been used primarily by pro-Israel media watchdogs (and some other pro-Israel commentators). For us to imply that the term has widespread usage is (i) incorrect and (ii) not supported by any sources. I suspect we'll have to take this to mediation, if you're not willing to accept any sort of compromise on this front.
Btw, my views about the nature of this term (I believe it to be racist) were applicable ''solely'' toward my decision to add the word ""some"" as a qualifer, which usage was consistent with both Wikipedia policy and basic common sense.

<user_id=CJCurrie>
''Addendum''' Here's what some published sources have said about term ""Pallywood"":
'France 2 has stuck by its story. But pro- Israeli commentators argue that this is finally independent proof of ``Pallywood'', the purported Palestinian-Hollywoodesque manufacture of news footage to further the cause, despite its fiction. We may never know the whole truth.'' (New Zealand Herald, 20 August 2008)
'Some Israelis and their supporters have suggested for years that video that might attract sympathy for Palestinians living under Israeli occupation is routinely staged and dismissed such scenes as ""Pallywood"" productions.'' (Robert Mackey, NYT Blogs, 5 August 2010)
'Since Hajj's work was discredited, the right-wing blogosphere has shifted into high gear, seeking out other potential instances of photo manipulation. Many are examining images from Qana, the site of an Israeli bombing last week where at least 28 civilians were killed. Others are digging into events in Gaza, claiming images from that Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been staged or edited for the cameras. Right-wing bloggers have dubbed that ""Pallywood."" '' (''Toronto Star'', 9 August 2006)

<user_id=CJCurrie>
Disputed wording the lede
Persons newly arrived at this discussion should note that there is currently a dispute as to the proper wording of the lede. I am prepared to accept the following wording:
''''Pallywood''', a portmanteau of ""Palestinian"" and ""Hollywood"", is a coinage that has been used by some pro-Israeli media watchdog advocates, among others, to describe alleged ""media manipulation, distortion and outright fraud by the Palestinians and other Arabs ... designed to win the public relations war against Israel."" The incidents of the Muhammad al-Durrah tapes and the 2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies (dubbed ""Hizbollywood"" or ""Hezbollywood"")'''ref name=""tagesspiegel""''''Im Zweifel für den Zweifel,' ''Der Tagesspiegel'' 2006-08-09]'''/ref''' are notable events which have been cited as examples.'''ref name=""jp071012""''''Caught in the Mohammad al-Dura crossfire, by Calev Ben-David, ''The Jerusalem Post'', October 12, 2007:: ''But pro-Israel media-watchdog advocates have gone further, arguing that the footage is a prime example of what has been dubbed ""Pallywood"" - media manipulation, distortion and outright fraud by the Palestinians (and other Arabs, such as the Reuters photographer caught faking photos during the Second Lebanon War), designed to win the public relations war against Israel.'''''/ref'''''
Others have proposed this wording:
''Pallywood''', a portmanteau of ""Palestinian"" and ""Hollywood"", is a coinage used to describe alleged cases of ""media manipulation, distortion and outright fraud by the Palestinians and other Arabs ... designed to win the public relations war against Israel."" The incidents of the Muhammad al-Durrah tapes and the 2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies (dubbed ""Hizbollywood"" or ""Hezbollywood"")'''ref name=""tagesspiegel""''''Im Zweifel für den Zweifel,' ''Der Tagesspiegel'' 2006-08-09]'''/ref''' are notable events which have been cited as examples.'''ref name=""jp071012""''''Caught in the Mohammad al-Dura crossfire, by Calev Ben-David, ''The Jerusalem Post'', October 12, 2007:: ''But pro-Israel media-watchdog advocates have gone further, arguing that the footage is a prime example of what has been dubbed ""Pallywood"" - media manipulation, distortion and outright fraud by the Palestinians (and other Arabs, such as the Reuters photographer caught faking photos during the Second Lebanon War), designed to win the public relations war against Israel.'''''/ref'''
I believe that the second wording is inappropriate in that it implies a greater currency for the term than actually exists. The term ""Pallywood"" is not widely used, and it is important for us to clarify within the lede that the term's usage is generally limited to a particular position within the Israel-Palestine dispute. Secondary sources (such as they exist) are clear on the term's framework. (I could add that passing references to the term within a few published studies are not sufficient evidence of wider usage.)
I believe that the term ""Pallywood"" is racist but I have not edited the article from this vantage point, except in that I added the word ""some"" before the phrase ""pro-Israel media watchdog advocates"" so as not to imply that all such advocates make use of the term. This action was not in any way inconsistent with Wikipedia policy.
I am open to compromise but I do not believe the second wording is at all acceptable. Comments and respectful dialogue are welcome.

<user_id=Jaakobou>
I can see your point about the second version suggesting it is of wide-usage when it is not. Give me a little while to think about a compromise suggestion. Considering your added sources, I'm conflicted on how to mention the groups which I see as most notable  i.e. pro-Israel advocates and media analysts. Another alternative, which is probably better  as I'm interested in maintaining the idea of a clear 'definition'  is to rephrase the usage part of the definition wich something such as 'which is sometimes used in the context of ""manufactured news""'. I'm open to suggestions here but I do hope you understand why I believe focusing on ""media-watchdog [organizations] advocates"" in the definition is undue.

<user_id=Jaakobou>
p.s. let's drop the word racist from the discussion. You don't see me throwing around my personal beliefs about Palestinian media. The point, which is supported by policy, is to help promote positive dialogue. ''''

<user_id=CJCurrie>
If you're willing to present a reasonable compromise suggestion, then I'm willing to consider it fairly. Thanks for taking my arguments into account.

<user_id=JonathanGo>
I completely disagree with the notion that ""Pallywood"" is not wide-used. google search on this terms gives 149,000 valid results.

",0,"The discussion begins with <user_id=CJCurrie> restoring the original introduction to an article and clarifying that not all pro-Israel media watchdogs use a specific term. The argument is based on maintaining the status quo of the article's wording and adding a qualifier for accuracy.

<user_id=Jaakobou> counters by demanding a source for the change and accuses <user_id=CJCurrie> of edit warring and introducing personal opinion. The argument here is based on Wikipedia guidelines that require sources for controversial statements.

<user_id=83.111.100.10> supports <user_id=CJCurrie>, but <user_id=Jaakobou> insists on the need for a source and dismisses the support as potentially coming from a sockpuppet.

<user_id=CJCurrie> then provides a source to justify the use of the term by pro-Israel media watchdogs and adds the qualifier ""some"" to avoid generalization. This shows an effort to adhere to Wikipedia's guidelines and provide a balanced view.

<user_id=Jaakobou> continues to argue that the term is not exclusively used by the group mentioned and provides three sources to support this claim. The argument is based on the diversity of usage of the term and the need for a clear definition without undue emphasis on a particular group.

<user_id=CJCurrie> responds by questioning the credibility of the sources provided by <user_id=Jaakobou> and argues that the term is primarily used by pro-Israel media watchdogs, which is supported by credible sources. The argument is based on the relevance and credibility of sources.

<user_id=Jaakobou> suggests that the term should not be defined by a single group and that the definition should be clear and supported by multiple sources. The argument is based on the need for a neutral and well-sourced definition.

<user_id=CJCurrie> provides additional published sources that mention the term in the context of pro-Israel commentators, reinforcing the argument that the term's usage is generally limited to a particular position within the Israel-Palestine dispute.

<user_id=Jaakobou> acknowledges the point made by <user_id=CJCurrie> about the term not being widely used and expresses willingness to consider a compromise.

<user_id=JonathanGo> disagrees with the notion that ""Pallywood"" is not widely used and provides a Google search result to support the claim. However, this argument is weak as it does not provide context or relevance to the quality of the sources found in the search results.

<user_id=Poyani> criticizes <user_id=JonathanGo> for using inflammatory language, which detracts from the discussion's quality.

Overall, the discussion shows a mix of well-reasoned arguments based on Wikipedia's guidelines, source credibility, and the importance of neutrality, as well as some less constructive comments that do not contribute to the resolution of the dispute. The participants mostly maintain a focus on factual accuracy, relevance, and adherence to Wikipedia's policies, although there are instances of personal beliefs and accusations that detract from the quality of the discussion.

Cannon's book review of an Eva Golinger book is followed in the same journal issue by another hardly any more critical review (of a different book by Golinger) by someone else. In any case, if we take this academic book to WP:RSN nobody's going to care about a book review which doesn't fit your opinion.

<user_id=SandyGeorgia>
There's no need to take it to RSN; we just have to know what we're using (as we do in all cases).  For instance, we need to know if we're parroting government data, CEPR, Golinger, Weisbrot, etc.  It is up to Lucky to be more forthcoming about what is in the book, and what data and sources it uses, so we can attribute it correctly, and decide whether it belongs in this article or elsewhere (daughter articles), according to due weight. It's a matter of using sources correctly.

<user_id=SandyGeorgia>
Just that it's the only thing I can find (and is an indication of what market the book appeals to).

<user_id=SandyGeorgia>
Also, same for Meade; we need to know what data she's citing.

<user_id=Rd232>
the ""market the book appeals to"" - please. It appeals to people interested in an academic assessment of ''Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution: Populism and Democracy in a Globalised Age''. It should hardly surprise you that this includes a bunch of old lefties. NB it's just been issued in paperback.

<user_id=Jrtayloriv>
The fact that this book appeals to Marxists is no more relevant than the fact that the Wall Street Journal appeals primarily to upper-class capitalists, as far as reliability is concerned.

<user_id=BCLH>
Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution: Populism and Democracy in a Globalised Age Barry Cannon (Lecturer DCU) and Sean Mitichell (SWP), It is a Lecturer in a Marxist Festival, he can be a Marxist but I think that eliminates him as a neutral or a reliable source of information. He speak spanish and remember that Venezuela Government has a lobby of its ideas all over the world. And most of the info of Cannon is not updated

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The initial request by <user_id=SandyGeorgia> is for establishing the credentials of Barry Cannon and for scholarly reviews of his book. This is a reasonable request as it seeks to verify the credibility of the source being used in the Wikipedia article.

2. <user_id=Lucky to be me> provides a quote from the back cover of the book by Professor Peadar Kirby, which praises Cannon's work. However, this does not constitute an independent scholarly review and is part of the book's promotional material.

3. <user_id=SandyGeorgia> correctly points out that promotional material does not establish the neutrality or scholarly reception of the book and insists on finding independent scholarly reviews.

4. <user_id=Rd232> mentions that Cannon is an academic and the book is published by an academic press, which is relevant but does not address the neutrality or quality of the content within the book.

5. <user_id=SandyGeorgia> raises concerns about the neutrality of Cannon's work based on a paper by Cannon, which they describe as lacking neutrality and critical analysis. This is a valid concern when considering the use of a source in a Wikipedia article.

6. <user_id=Rd232> and <user_id=Jrtayloriv> argue that Cannon's participation in a Marxist festival does not necessarily discredit his work. This is a fair point, as the political leanings of an author do not inherently affect the reliability of their academic work.

7. <user_id=BCLH> questions Cannon's neutrality based on his participation in a Marxist festival and suggests that this may disqualify him as a neutral or reliable source. This argument is less strong because it does not provide evidence of bias in Cannon's academic work itself.

Overall, the discussion shows a mix of valid concerns about source credibility and neutrality, as well as some arguments that do not directly address the quality of Cannon's work. The participants are engaged in a critical examination of the source, which is a positive aspect of the discussion. However, there is a lack of independent scholarly reviews presented in the discussion, which would have been the most direct way to assess the quality and reception of Cannon's work.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 6.5",6.5
"<user_id=Tuscumbia>
Azerbaijani khanates

<user_id=Tuscumbia>
Magotteers, the source () clearly says the khanates were Azerbaijani and the line in the article clearly says ''Caucasian khanates or the northern Azerbaijani khanates'' which is a sufficient compromise on part of the editor. I'm not really understanding why you are trying to diminish or get rid of the fact that these khanates were Azerbaijani.

<user_id=Tuscumbia>
And deportations is the proper term to be used since those were state sponsored movements of ethnic Azerbaijanis and relocation of Persian and Ottoman Armenians in their places, planning initiated and/or assisted by ethnic Armenians Lazarev and Mikoyan. With your logic, should we also consider deportation of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey from Eastern Anatolia to Middle East as ''population movement''? You're taking it to another level with continuous edit-warring. If you keep doing it, you will be reported. Thank you.

<user_id=Magotteers>
No, that's not a compromise. How can you call it that, when one side allow the existance of a duplicate article of Azeri and Turkic people of Armenia with a different name and besides its intro, it says nothing about the claimed subject it is supposed to discuss about. I can find more sources calling it a ''Persian Khanate'' (eg. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Sources also exist for ''Iranian Khanates'', including written by Turks, eg. 1, 2, etc. Besides, historically speaking the term ''Azerbaijan'' in that context had nothing to do with the current identity called ''Azerbaijani'' which is used as an ethnic identity rather than a qualifier of a geographic region within Iran. For that alone it should be sufficient to remove it on sight for any articles written for the general public since it requires a knowledge which generally they do not pocess.
Deportation is not a proper term, how is the ethnic clash of 1905-07 a deportation, there was no ''Armenian government'' then to start with, the claim of more than 200,000 Azeri being ''deported'' made by Van der Leeuw can't be backed by any statistical data (not to say that he is overtly an advocate of the Azeri cause), that's more than the entire recorded Azeri population of Armenia.

<user_id=Tuscumbia>
It ''is'' a compromise. Make an extra effort and type ''Azerbaijani khanates'' in google search and you'll come up with the Google Books results sufficient to determine that these khanates were Azerbaijani. The population was Azerbaijani Turks. They were independent and semi-independent depending on their agreements and treaties with Russian and Iran. The term deported is the correct term and I have already provided an explanation above.

<user_id=Magotteers>
Checking a wording in google book to support what à priori you support is sherry picking, comparaison is '''not''' (like the one I have done by searching different words). There are works which calls it Persian Khanates, Iranian Khanates. So leaving off any qualifier is the most sound thing to do. Also, ''Azerbaijani'' in the historic sense of the term has no ethnic meaning contrary to the modern definition of the word. It simply means that it was during the hight of the Iranian Empire, its Azerbaijan, derived from its province Azerbaijan. While it might sound relevant to use ''Azerbaijan'' or ''Azerbaijani'' for those initiated with the history of the region, that's not acceptable in a publication open to the public, a public who only know as ''Azerbaijani'' the modern identity of the Azeri Turks.

<user_id=Kheo17>
Magotteers, I put that ""Azerbaijani khanates"" term back in the article and tried to make more compromise on that sentence. I want you to inform that the source is from the Cambridge University Press. Moreover, the author of the work is an American-Polish professor and Caucasologist. I warn you last time! If you continue on removing my sourced content I will report you..

<user_id=Anastasia.Bukh>
Magoteers, you create disruption everywhere. He rudely dismisses all third party sources! Kheo, please report him!

<user_id=Magotteers>
That's a serious accusation you have here, an ''argumentum ad personam'' at its best. Unless you have anything concerning the article itself, don't add any more unfounded accusations against me. Kheo17, I did not remove it because it was unsourced, I removed it because it is sherry picking and that we can also add and source ''Persian'' and ''Iranian'' Khanate and that ''Azerbaijani'' in those sources have little or nothing to do with what we entend as ''Azerbaijani'' in the modern sense. There is a semantic change, a definition drift to the point that several authors need to add when treating the history of the region that the ''Azerbaijan'' they are refering to has not the same meaning as the modern term. Also, I'd like you to go further by actually reporting me and I will express how the article is basically a duplicate of an existing article which only difference is an intro and the title. Also to add, that you have included a map for instance, that the legend was removed and passed by you as something which original author did not intend. I was even reverted by you guys for simply clarifying that.

<user_id=Tuscumbia>
Why did you move the article to ''ideological concept''. This is not an ''ideological concept''. It is a ''political concept'' and this has already been discussed. Again, it is not a duplicate. This article is as much an article as Greater Armenia (political concept) article the text in which has been duplicated from other Armenia-related articles.

<user_id=Kheo17>
Magotteers, I did not put the map of the region after the Serves Treaty. However, the other three maps are mine. I find that map useless as well, so I am going to remove it from there. What concerns the khanates, you can find considerable number of sources arguing the existence of the Azerbaijani khanates in the modern Azerbaijani and Armenian territory.

<user_id=Kheo17>
I did not report anybody here yet, but somebody already reported me!

<user_id=Magotteers>
A political concept may also be ideological, since it is beyond the scope of simply being political... I replaced it for ideological. The article is a duplicate... besides its intro, 100% is a duplicate from another article. As for Greater Armenia (political concept), if you have a problem with it, bring it there not here.

<user_id=Magotteers>
Read what I wrote above again!

<user_id=Kheo17>
Marshall Bagramyan, even Democratic Republic of Armenia's map was not recognized by the Allied Powers. Neither Wilsonian Armenia nor the Greater Armenia. It doesn't give you the right to remove the map of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

<user_id=MarshallBagramyan>
Armenia's western borders ''were'' properly delineated by the United States but the eastern borders had yet to be delineated. If we all accept this to be true, then we cannot present that map as if it presents borders which were internationally recognized. You are distorting the material and inserting point of view where none exists.

<user_id=78.86.151.248>
Exactly, ADR was never recognised withing those borders. If ADR claimed those lands it does not mean that they belong to them. They did not have control over that territory so how can it be ""split"" from them, infact most of the time Armenian forces had control over those lands and more. But like Marshall mentioned there were no set borders between those new republics, so there is no way one can claim that something was split, taken away from them or whatever.

<user_id=Tuscumbia>
Oh yes, of course, Magotteers was blocked, now we have another sock jumping from article to article and mysteriously finding articles through google ) IP, ADR's borders including Zangezur were de-facto recognized in January 1920 in the Peace Conference while DRA borders were never recognized except for Wilsonian Armenia recognized by Wilson himself, which does not include the present day Armenia.

<user_id=MarshallBagramyan>
Zangezur was a bastion of anti-Soviet resistance (under the command of Garegin Njdeh) by the Armenians during the summer of 1920. Even if Azerbaijan's ''de facto'' control of these borders was recognized, that does not mean that they were ''de jure'' recognized, which means that caption as well as the the map is inaccurate because this area should be shown as being disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan never ""lost"" these territories because it never fully established control of these regions; it was hardly able to come to a compromise with the Armenians regarding Karabakh. Some of the sources for this article are still insufficient and very poor when it comes to reliability and we need maps produced by historians, not user-generated ones which pick and choose what to highlight and what do omit.

<user_id=Magotteers>
Care to explain the name change?

<user_id=Tuscumbia>
Yes, please see the discussion above, initially offered by MarshallBagramyan and agreed on by others.

<user_id=Magotteers>
A political concept is an ideological concept, if it is mostly used by Yeraz, it can't only be a political concept.

<user_id=Tuscumbia>
It's not only Yeraz who use it. It's been and is used throughout Azerbaijan and is a political concept as much as the term Greater Armenia.

<user_id=Magotteers>
This further proves that it is not only a political concept. Neither is Greater Armenia only a political concept. Greater Armenia was a historical, geographical and is now an ideological concept. So there is no reason to add anything to ''Greater Armenia'', because the term is not alone what a clarification implies. On the other hand, the claim of Western Azerbaijan for the republic of Armenia is a modern Azeri construct which is ideological. While it is true that it is political, it is not only political, because ''political'' is only one type of ideology.

<user_id=Tuscumbia>
So was Azerbaijan. It is referred to as Western Azerbaijan because it was a part of Safavi, Ak Koyunlu, Kara Koyunlu states with Azerbaijani Turkic majority until a certain time in recent history. Ideology is something rather distancing from the realm, regardless whether the realm was the past, present or future.

<user_id=Magotteers>
That's an interpretation, in the case of Armenia, there is no ''it is referred to because''..., there is no because or words to imply there is an interpretation. See the sources you find for Greater Armenia from google book when you restrict the date of the publications between 1700 and 1800, and then the results for between the years 1600 to 1700. ''Greater Armenia'' is a geographical, historical and an ideological concept. The fact that this modern ''Western Azerbaijan'' restricts to exactly the borders within Armenia is solely an ideological concept, it might be political, but political is also an ideology.

<user_id=Magotteers>
Besıdes, if you have a problem with the article ''Greater Armenia'' bring ıt there, not here.

<user_id=Tuscumbia>
It's not an interpretation, it's a fact. The only reason Azerbaijani Turks did not use the term as much as today is because they never claimed the territories of their neighbors and because there was never an ideological concept of ''Greater Azerbaijan'', again because Azerbaijan never laid any claims to its neighbors. That's why you won't see as much in google books although I had already provided the google books results on this talk page. You can in circles over and over again but the article name has been discussed and compromised on already.

<user_id=MarshallBagramyan>
Western Azerbaijan is a modern 20th century invention and it was never used as a geographical or historical term for the territories the Republic of Armenia is now located upon. This region was always called ""Eastern Armenia"" and labeled as such in maps and the Armenians only became a minority after Shah Abbas I's deportation of the Armenian population. The real western Azerbaijan can be said to be the western portion of the Iranian province south of the Araks River.

<user_id=Magotteers>
That's a generalization, you are putting a racial characteristic here, be careful to not cross the border between simple characterization and racism. The google book result is irrelevant, since most of it refers to the Western portion of the republic of Azerbaijan. Also, we're not talking about compromise, you have offered no answer to counter my argument that the term ''Western Azerbaijan'' to refer to the modern republic of Armenia with clearly defined borders not extending in Georgia nor Turkey is only a political concept.

<user_id=Tuscumbia>
Yes, it wasn't a historical term because there was no unified state '''called''' ''Azerbaijan'' or containing the word ''Azerbaijan'' in its name until 1918. But the region and population of the Azerbaijani states were Azerbaijani Turks. The term appeared in the 20th century to refer to a political concept.

<user_id=Tuscumbia>
Please save that ''racism'' nonsense for someone else. You make that kind of false accusations one more time, you will be reported again. Western Azerbaijan is a political concept. When you clearly define what you understand under ''political'' and ''ideological'' concepts, we can revisit the term.

<user_id=Magotteers>
Your tone was unwaranted, I said be careful, not that you were. As for ideological vs political, read the intro of Ideology, you will see it includes ''political''.

<user_id=Tuscumbia>
I warned you. Now, I asked you to define not to direct to the article. When you define it in your own words, not as it is written in or may be interpreted from Ideology article, I'll be able to understand what it is that you really want. So, clarify what you understand under ''political'' and ''ideological'' concepts and the difference between them, and we will go from there.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The discussion revolves around the historical characterization of the khanates in the region of present-day Azerbaijan and Armenia. The term ""Azerbaijani khanates"" is contested, with one side arguing for its use based on modern sources and the other side arguing against it, citing historical context and potential anachronism.

2. The term ""deportation"" is also debated. One side argues that it is the correct term to describe the movement of ethnic Azerbaijanis and the relocation of Persian and Ottoman Armenians, while the other side suggests that the term is not appropriate for all instances discussed, such as the ethnic clashes of 1905-07.

3. The discussion includes references to sources and the interpretation of terms like ""Azerbaijani,"" ""Persian Khanates,"" and ""Iranian Khanates."" The argument is made that the term ""Azerbaijani"" in historical contexts does not necessarily align with the modern ethnic identity.

4. The debate extends to the political and ideological concepts of ""Western Azerbaijan"" and ""Greater Armenia."" The discussion touches on the historical and geographical implications of these terms and their modern usage.

5. The participants engage in a back-and-forth about the appropriateness of maps and borders, with references to historical events and international recognition.

6. The tone of the discussion occasionally becomes confrontational, with accusations of cherry-picking, unfounded accusations, and warnings of reporting to moderators.

7. The participants struggle to agree on the definitions of ""political"" and ""ideological"" concepts, which is central to their argument about the naming and characterization of the region.

Overall, the discussion shows a mix of well-referenced points and personal interpretations of history. The participants demonstrate some knowledge of the subject matter but also engage in circular arguments and occasional ad hominem attacks. The discussion could benefit from a more structured debate and a focus on establishing common definitions and understandings before arguing the finer points of the historical narrative.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5
"<user_id=Jack Upland>
The Battle of Chosin Reservoir was part of a shambolic retreat, but this article tries to portray it as some kind of triumph.

<user_id=Jack Upland>
NPOV

<user_id=Jack Upland>
There are three sources cited for the claim in the infobox that it was a ""tactical victory"" for the UN (US):
Quigley (not a professional historian) describes it as ""an epic, born out of disaster, in a series of brilliant, hardfought tactical victories, while at the same time for the Army's Tenth Corps and Macarthur's HQ in Tokyo, it was a crushing strategic defeat"" (the ''Foreword'').
Edwards, discussing the ''perception'' of the battle, asks, ""How has this event become a tactical victory for the Marines and a disgraceful loss for the army that was fighting next to them?"" (p 67). Elsewhere he says that the retreat was a ""masterpiece of military stupidity and unpreparedness that has somehow become tragically heroic"" (p 64), the ""greatest defeat and rout of military forces in American history"" (p 65). Citing this source is cherrypicking in the extreme.
Cowley - I cannot access it via Google Books.
Looking at other sources:
Bruce Cumings, one of the leading American historians of Korea, describes it as a ""terrible defeat"" (''Korea's Place in the Sun'', p 280).
The National Museum of the US Army describes it as a ""nightmare"".
Roy Appleman, American military historian, says, ""Its hallmarks were misery, soul-crushing cold, privation, exhaustion, heroism, sacrifice, leadership of high merit at times, but finally, unit and individual disaster... It would be hard to find a more nearly hopeless or more tragic story in American military history"" .
I accept that (a) the US soldiers fought well (at times), (b) they inflicted heavy losses on the other side (perhaps), (c) they frustrated some of the strategic goals of the other side (perhaps), and (d) some of them managed to retreat to South Korea. But these things are true in many defeats. They don't stop this being a defeat for the US. This shouldn't be a jingoistic American propaganda piece. This is supposed to be an encyclopedia with a policy of neutrality.

<user_id=Jack Upland>
There doesn't seem to be a source which says it was a ""UN tactical victory"" and a ""Chinese strategic victory"", so the infobox shouldn't say this. This is just a synthesis of different comments. And, clearly, it doesn't represent a consensus of the sources. It's also a contradiction to say this and also to say in the lead that it was a ""decisive battle"".

<user_id=192.68.112.170>
Well, Wikipedia should reflect the sources. The problem is the sources themselves, written mostly by American scholars, are biased. The worst strategic disaster in the US history is still a victory for Americans because, well, no American would buy a book about how their country lost. This is a general weakness of Wikipedia and you can find similar patterns in other articles. In short, you have no hope against it.

<user_id=AustralianRupert>
G'day, Jack, thank you for sharing your thoughts. I think that the two main editors who worked on this article are no longer very active, but will ping them anyway in the hope that maybe they can address your concerns.  Failing that, if there are no responses, the best solution may be for you to boldly make changes you are proposing and then see what others think. Regards,

Thanks, . I made a few changes yesterday. I thought it was better to raise the issue on the Talk page first.

<user_id=Jack Upland>
I have removed the NPOV tag because I have made the relevant changes to the infobox and the lead, and there appears to be no dispute.

<user_id=Ed!>
Thanks for your changes! And indeed your concerns. There's a frustration with Korean War history that North Korean and Chinese sources tend to be unreliable, and so the western historians tend to rely on the US Army's own research on the events. I think you've set it on a good path. —

<user_id=Jim101>
Most of my reasoning on how to described the victory condition has been described in the section Talk:Battle_of_Chosin_Reservoir#Chinese_Pyrrhic_victory. In summary, my thoughts are:
Is it a strategic victory for the Chinese? IMO it is not per citation 1, if the one of the main result of this battle is Chinese got defeated and chased out of South Korea after Jan 1951.
Is it a operational/tactical victory for the Chinese? IMO it is a bit half and half...to play devil's advocate, does it count as a win if your entire army turned into a ""field hospital"" for three months and the enemy only yield ground due to situations on the other side of Korean peninsula?
if it is not a clear cut strategic or tactical win for the Chinese side, then what is this victory should be called?
Although I do agree with one point with , I definitely think it is grossly inaccurate to describe this battle as some kind of ""UN victory"".

<user_id=Wingwraith>
1) You'll want to lay off the histrionics. Describing it as a ""shambolic retreat"" when the infobox says that ""40% of Chinese combat forces in Korea disabled until March 1951"" and calling for neutrality when you described the prior version of the article as a ""jingoistic American propaganda piece"" doesn't prove anything except the fact that you don't know what the hell you are even writing about.

<user_id=Wingwraith>
2) I concur with your recommendation to leave that part of the infobox out. Alternatively we can go with what  wrote here (which is to describe the result of the battle as ""Disputed"") but FTR I think that it's one of those rare cases where it's better to not mention the result so as to keep the wording as neutral as possible and just let the reader decide. Some of the sources describe the outcome of the battle specifically as a ""UN tactical victory"" or ""Chinese strategic victory"" but like you said they don't represent the consensus position on the issue. Either way calling it just a ""Chinese victory"" (or some form of that) is a complete misrepresentation of what happened during the battle.

<user_id=Wingwraith>
3a) Quigley's quote supports my description of the battle as tactical victory for the UN and strategic victory for the Chinese.
3b) Same with Edwards
3c) That's what Cowley says
3d) Can't comment on Cummings as I can't access it
3e) The portrayal of the actions of the involved unit by the US Army source is consistent with my description of the battle as a tactical victory for the UN. ('''""Many historians now agree that Task Force MacLean blocked the Chinese drive along the eastern side of Chosin for five days and allowed the Marines along the west side to withdraw into Hagaru-ri. Furthermore, the task force destroyed the CCF 80th Division. In recognition of their bravery, Task Force MacLean/Faith was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation in September 1999.'''"")
3f) The article that quotes Applebaum portrays the actions of the involved unit in a way that is consistent with my description of the battle as a tactical victory for the UN. ('''""But a number of historians and some Marine veterans of Chosin now believe that the 1st Marine Division might have been destroyed had the poorly armed, ill-trained soldiers of Task Force Faith not bought time by keeping the Chinese from sweeping south. Chinese papers reviewed in recent years by military scholars have shown that the Army task force fought a significantly larger enemy force than commonly understood.""''')

<user_id=Jack Upland>
So, we all agree that it shouldn't be called a ""UN victory""?

<user_id=Wingwraith>
No we all agree that that part of the infobox should be left out. You would have known that if you (cared to) read what I and you wrote.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Jack Upland begins the discussion by challenging the portrayal of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir as a triumph, suggesting that it was instead a defeat. He provides detailed references to support his view, indicating a high level of engagement with the material.

2. Jack Upland's second and third points raise concerns about neutrality and the synthesis of different comments in the article, which is a valid concern in maintaining an unbiased and accurate encyclopedia entry.

3. The anonymous user (192.68.112.170) provides a cynical view on the bias inherent in sources, which, while it may reflect a common sentiment, does not directly contribute to improving the article's neutrality or factual accuracy.

4. AustralianRupert responds constructively by suggesting that Jack Upland make the changes he proposes and see how others react, which is a practical approach to resolving disputes on Wikipedia.

5. Jack Upland then takes initiative by making changes to the article and removing the NPOV tag, indicating a proactive approach to resolving the issue.

6. Ed! acknowledges the difficulty in relying on sources due to potential biases and commends Jack Upland for his efforts, showing an understanding of the complexities involved in historical documentation.

7. Jim101 provides a nuanced view on the nature of the victory conditions, which adds depth to the discussion but also introduces some ambiguity regarding the outcome of the battle.

8. Wingwraith's first response is confrontational and dismissive, which detracts from the overall quality of the discussion. However, his subsequent points provide a counterargument and reference sources that support a different perspective, which is valuable for a balanced discussion.

9. The final exchange between Jack Upland and Wingwraith shows a consensus forming around leaving out the disputed part of the infobox, which is a constructive outcome of the discussion.

Overall, the discussion includes a mix of well-referenced arguments, constructive suggestions, and a few instances of confrontational language. The participants show a willingness to engage with the material and each other, despite some disagreements. The discussion moves towards a resolution that aims to improve the neutrality of the article.

When I proposed this page for deletion I notified almost everyone who voted - AND THEY ALL VOTED AGAINST DELETION - you see I am just learning at this, I ask other editors for help.  I have even asked you for help.  So seriously what is your deal?  Why are you fighting against the just inclusion of a section citing 2 of the 3 biggest papers in New York?  Why are you deleting my assertation (100% factual and NPOV - and TAKEN FROM ASW's own site) that they now accept membership applications?  What is your beef? (  )

<user_id=Mostlyoksorta>
like i said at the time i am on a shared computer and have to login and off.  when i proposed for deletion i forgot to login, but i quickly corrected myself in all further edits on this matter (  )

<user_id=IIIraute>
Hitherto, nothing more than an allegation: ""''Tonny Uy has filed a gender-discrimination lawsuit against his former empress ployer, A Small World, where he worked as an accountant. He claims he lost his job because he asked for the same amount of paid family leave given to female workers.''"" & ""''A man says his Manhattan employer — an exclusive online social network for the rich — fired him because he asked for the same amount of paid family leave given to female workers.''"" here""''Man sues employer for alleged firing over paternity leave''"" & ""''A gay man socked his snooty employer — a social-networking site that bills itself as a “myspace for millionaires” — with a lawsuit Wednesday alleging that he was wrongfully fired after seeking paternity leave when his daughter was born.''"" here

<user_id=Mostlyoksorta>
also please stop revealing what you think to be personal information about me. It is threatening and  I mentioned before and violates Wikipedia policy. New York is a big place with lots of people, so I'm not sure what your claim can be  meant as other than a threat (  )(  )

I'll warn you though if you do apply, you probably will ask for your money back hahahaha ;)''""You are clearly biased - and your edits are not NPOV!

<user_id=Mostlyoksorta>
what is not NPOV about stating that there is a pending federal lawsuit? I am still missing the point? THERE IS A FEDERAL CASE INVOLVING ASMALLWORLD - if I was not NPOV I would mention my feelings on that issue, which are less than favorable.  However, I simply stated a very clear fact.  There is a case against ASW and that involves gender discrimination. (  )

<user_id=Mostlyoksorta>
Also I have been honest, you never answered ARE YOU PAID BY ASW? (  )

<user_id=Mostlyoksorta>
also don't be jealous that I am the member of an ultra exclusive club and your not, JK get a sense of humor brother (  )

<user_id=Mostlyoksorta>
also, once you are done answering whether or not you accept compensation from ASW, please let me know why your entire talk page history is filled with conflicts, why are you so into page blanking and starting fights? It can't be so boring in whatever little town you live in (  )

<user_id=Mostlyoksorta>
also i think it is very hypocritical that you are citing arguing about this topic when you were a frequent contributor to ANOTHER PENDING LEGAL MATTER Oscar Pistorius' trial.  Not sure why you think it is ok to write about that trial and not this one.  So I'll ask another question, what is your substantive problem with this Law Suit section? (  )

<user_id=IIIraute>
I did not revert this content again, so I am not fighting anything - however, IMHO your contributions to this article are not NPOV, and look like some kind of revenge campaign - you have mentioned private e-mails you have exchanged with the company, and also this. Both, the RipoffReport Complaint Review, and your first edits on this article (together with User:Faceplant2020 and the IP), happen to share the same date: 28. March 2014. Please note that the IP also relocates to New York; i.e. the same location from the RipoffReport Complaint Review. In your comment above, you did write: ""''When I proposed this page for deletion...''"" - however, please be aware of the fact, that it was the IP that proposed the deletion of the article.    WP:OUTING, WP:IDENTIFYUNCIVIL WP:AOHA (  )

<user_id=IIIraute>
I don't have a problem with this section, and I did revert this content only once - however, IMHO your contributions to this article are biased and not NPOV.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. Relevance of the lawsuit: User Mostlyoksorta argues that the lawsuit is a significant event that should be included in the article, citing coverage in major newspapers and its status as a federal civil rights case. This is a strong argument for inclusion as it appeals to the notability and relevance of the information.

2. Allegation vs. lawsuit distinction: User IIIraute emphasizes that the lawsuit is still an allegation, suggesting caution in how the information is presented. This is a valid point, as Wikipedia's guidelines on biographies of living persons and potentially defamatory content require careful wording and neutrality.

3. Civility and personal attacks: The discussion deteriorates into personal attacks and accusations of bias, which detracts from the quality of the argumentation. User Mostlyoksorta's comments become increasingly uncivil and confrontational, which is not conducive to a constructive debate.

4. Neutrality and bias: User IIIraute questions the neutrality of User Mostlyoksorta's contributions, suggesting a personal vendetta may be influencing the edits. While it is important to ensure neutrality, the evidence provided (such as the same date of edits and RipoffReport Complaint Review) is circumstantial and does not directly prove bias.

5. Consistency in editing standards: User Mostlyoksorta points out that User IIIraute has contributed to articles on other pending legal matters, questioning the consistency of their stance on the lawsuit. This is a fair point that challenges the application of Wikipedia's guidelines across different articles.

6. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: User Mostlyoksorta repeatedly asks User IIIraute if they are compensated by the subject of the article, which is a serious accusation without evidence. While it is important to disclose conflicts of interest, making such claims without proof is not appropriate.

7. Privacy and outing: User IIIraute accuses User Mostlyoksorta of outing and uncivil behavior, which is a serious concern on Wikipedia. However, the evidence provided is not conclusive, and the accusation itself does not directly address the quality of the argument regarding the edit.

Overall, the discussion includes some valid points regarding the relevance and presentation of the lawsuit information. However, the dialogue is marred by personal attacks, accusations of bias without clear evidence, and a lack of focus on content quality and Wikipedia guidelines. The arguments fluctuate in quality, with some being well-founded and others being less so.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 4.5.",4.5
"<user_id=Piotrus>
I don't think this speculation is notable enough to justify even a mention here, not to mention a section. See my rationale . |

<user_id=Piotrus>
Section on 'Allegations of censorship' should be deleted

<user_id=GizzyCatBella>
Agreed,

<user_id=Pharos>
(ec) I agree ""possibly the first application of the new Holocaust law"" is clearly incorrect.  It does seem like there is a chilling effect with the local government's overzealousness, though.

<user_id=Icewhiz>
WP:RSes disagree (particularly the English speaking ones which are more accessible to me) - I think it should be in - however I am not averse to modifications in language here (e.g. chilling effect) - if there are WP:RSes to back it up (while I might agree this is a chilling effect - i.e. perhaps local government being wary of sponsoring/participating in an event that would contain possible violations of the law - that's WP:OR by our part without a source saying so).At present, this event was fairly widely covered. The vast majority of the coverage we have on the new portions of the law (the 2018 amendment) are media-based (we did have a bunch of holocaust scholars speak up in op-eds in the media - but I don't think there is credible peer-review journal coverage yet - it is simply too new) - it is still in the ""current event"" realm.

<user_id=Piotrus>
The point is this is only speculate to be related to the new law. It would be one thing and totally relevant if someone was charged. But if someone spoke before a smaller audience because someone else didn't want to listen... this is business as usual. Honestly, new law or not, I expect the very same thing would happen anyway - the claim of '200,000' is controversial in Poland (and not only) and many people would complain and cause some trouble anyway. Currently we have 3:1 in favor of removing this section, so I think it should go. At best, could try to summarize it to a single sentence and include in some other relevant section; but this totally does not deserve a section of its own. |

<user_id=Icewhiz>
If we run a RfC on this - I think you know what the result will be - with over 10 RSes reporting on this (and mentioning the new ""Holocaust law"" explicitly), this will easily pass a RfC. What I think is unusual - is the Polish authorities asking for the speech in advance for a historical review - I do not think one usually asks visitors for their speech in advance in order to review its ""acceptability"" - or to be precise, I do not think this was done in the past.

<user_id=Piotrus>
Feel free to run an RfC on this, I would not be sure of the result. As for asking for a copy of the speech, I'd think this has been done on occasion. How common the practice is, hard to say. For now I've merged this section with other criticism, we don't need a separate section for each minor development. |

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Piotrus argues that the speculation about the event being related to the new Holocaust law is not notable enough to warrant a section in the article. The user emphasizes the lack of charges being filed as a reason for the section's irrelevance.

2. User GizzyCatBella agrees with Piotrus, but does not provide additional reasoning.

3. User Pharos acknowledges the incorrectness of a specific claim (""possibly the first application of the new Holocaust law"") but suggests that there might be a ""chilling effect"" due to local government actions. This user introduces the concept of a chilling effect but does not provide a source to back up this claim.

4. User Icewhiz points out that there are reliable sources (WP:RSes) that disagree with Piotrus and that the event has been widely covered. Icewhiz is open to modifying the language used in the section but insists on the inclusion of the event due to the coverage it has received. This user also brings up the unusual request by Polish authorities for a speech review, which is not common practice.

5. User Piotrus responds to Icewhiz by suggesting that the practice of asking for a speech in advance might not be uncommon and merges the controversial section with other criticism to avoid having a separate section for each minor development.

Evaluation of Arguments:

- User Piotrus provides a clear rationale for why the section might not be necessary, focusing on the lack of legal action and the speculative nature of the connection to the new law.
- User GizzyCatBella agrees with Piotrus but does not add to the argument.
- User Pharos introduces a new angle with the ""chilling effect"" but does not substantiate it with sources.
- User Icewhiz brings in the perspective of media coverage and reliable sources, arguing for the inclusion of the event based on its notability and the unusual actions of the authorities.
- User Piotrus counters Icewhiz's argument by suggesting that the practice of speech review might not be as unusual as claimed and takes action to consolidate the section with other criticisms.

Overall, the discussion shows a mix of well-reasoned arguments and some assertions without substantial backing. The participants are engaging with each other's points, and there is a clear effort to reach a consensus based on Wikipedia's guidelines and the availability of reliable sources. The discussion could be improved with more evidence for some of the claims, such as the frequency of speech reviews by authorities and the presence of a chilling effect.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.",7.0

Mmmm...following you POV, we must label as ""X propaganda"" (X being communist, fascist, capitalist, nationalist, etc...) every military museum that discredits or claim atrocities by their opponents...Sincerely, that's not a credible argument. I dont want to enter an edit war, but if you maintain that position you leave me with only two options: removing that category or adding a NPOV tag.I hope we can reach an agreement on this.KID

<user_id=Mztourist>
If you can identify similar bias, such as the repeated use of ""puppet"", ""mercenary"", ""murders"" etc and outrageous claims such as a rifle used to kill 64 soldiers in other museums, then yes, they should be labelled as ""X propaganda"" too. In relation to your two options, you have a third option, stop picking a fight about the obvious bias of a museum that you haven't visited.

<user_id=HCPUNXKID>
First, the use of terms as ""puppet"", ""mercenary"", ""murders"", etc... on captions have as much to do with communism as with capitalism, that's it, nothing. So if your only argument for adding that category is the use of that terminology on captions, sorry, but you simply dont have any argument. Second, and I repeat it for the second time, it doesnt matter that I dont have visited that museum. Most WP users edit articles about places or events in wich they dont have been present, and obviously that doesnt disqualify them. Finally, it seems to me that you dont want to reach an agreement, as I gave you two options and you reject both, trying instead to impose your POV on this article.KID

<user_id=Mztourist>
Really???? Those words mean nothing? Do you seriously believe that? Repeated use of those terms is clear evidence that the Museum pushes a particular POV. I have only given the English captions, you can assume that the Vietnamese captions are even more biased. All Museums in Vietnam adopt the same propaganda tone because beating the French and the Americans is the sole basis for the Vietnamese Communist Party's legitimacy. English obviously isn't your first language so perhaps where you live these kind of terms are normal, but for a native English speaker they scream out propaganda. Who/what gives you the right to set out options anyway? You need to present a clear argument that the Museum isn't Communist propaganda before you go reverting the category or you can escalate this to another forum, in the meantime leave the category as it is.

<user_id=HCPUNXKID>
No man, its you who have to undisputedly prove that the whole museum is ""Communist propaganda"", that's a severe accusation to label a whole museum, or in your case all the museums in Vietnam!?!. Again, most if not all military museums in the world would (more or less) discredit the enemies, so thats a very, very weak argument to make. Also, about ""so perhaps where you live these kind of terms are normal, but for a native English speaker they scream out propaganda"", Wikipedia (doesnt matter if its english version or other) aint made for english, spanish or vietnamese speakers, but for ALL people, despite the language they speak, the ideology they have or the country they came from. And finally, Who/what gives you the right to add unilaterally dubious POV-driven categories anyway? Making the majority of the article doesnt give you extra rights to decide about it, dude. Unless you gave serious proof of what you claim, I will delete that unjustified category, as it seems you added because of your political views, and that's not what Wikipedia is about...KID

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. User Mztourist argues that the museum's use of specific language such as ""puppet,"" ""mercenary,"" ""murders,"" etc., in its display captions indicates a bias that aligns with communist propaganda. They provide examples of the captions and argue that the consistent use of such language is evidence of a particular point of view being pushed by the museum.

2. User HCPUNXKID counters that the use of such terms does not necessarily equate to communist propaganda and that military museums around the world often present information in a way that discredits their enemies. They argue that Mztourist's reasoning is not sufficient to label the entire museum as propaganda.

3. Mztourist responds by emphasizing the repeated use of the terms and suggests that the language used is not typical for an unbiased historical account. They also bring up the point that the legitimacy of the Vietnamese Communist Party is tied to their historical victories, which could influence the museum's narrative.

4. HCPUNXKID insists that Mztourist needs to provide undisputed proof that the museum is communist propaganda and that the argument presented is weak. They also emphasize that Wikipedia is for all people, regardless of language or ideology, and that adding categories based on political views is not appropriate.

Evaluation of Arguments:

- Mztourist provides specific examples from the museum's captions, which is a strong point in their argument. However, they do not provide external sources or a broader context to support the claim that the entire museum, or all museums in Vietnam, are vehicles for communist propaganda.
  
- HCPUNXKID makes a valid point that military museums often present information from a particular perspective and that the use of certain terms alone does not prove the museum is propaganda. They also correctly point out that Wikipedia's content should be accessible and relevant to all users, not just native English speakers or those from a particular ideological background.

- Both users could improve their arguments by providing more evidence and context. For example, Mztourist could reference academic sources discussing the nature of propaganda in museums, while HCPUNXKID could provide examples of similar language used in non-communist military museums to support their claim that such language is not unique to communist propaganda.

Overall, the discussion shows some understanding of the issues at hand but lacks depth and comprehensive evidence to support the claims made by both parties. The arguments are somewhat circular and do not progress towards a resolution or a more nuanced understanding of the issue.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.",5.0
"<user_id=Erik den yngre>
Nordic countries

<user_id=Erik den yngre>
Denmark, Norway and Sweden have during the last 10-15 years amended their constitutions such that Lutheran churches are now separated from the state, after 500 years of unity. Lutheranism is no longer the public religion and the church is no longer a branch of the government. — ''''

<user_id=Wtmitchell>
The details are a bit more complicated than that (e.g., Article 4 in Part i of the Danish constitution does say, ""The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, and, as such, it shall be supported by the State."", with some detail about that added in Part VII there), and the question is how much of that detail ought to be covered in this article. Perhaps a note something like  ''See also: Constitution of Denmark'' ought to be added to the info on Denmark in this article and similar notes and wikilinks to Constitution of Sweden and the Constitution of Norway articles for the other countries. Also, re ""10-15 years"", see WP:DATED.    (earlier ''Boracay Bill'')

<user_id=Erik den yngre>
Article 16 in Norway's constitution: ""Den norske kirke, en evangelisk-luthersk kirke, forblir Norges folkekirke og understøttes som sådan av staten. ... Alle tros- og livssynssamfunn skal understøttes på lik linje."" Translated: ""The church of Norway, an evangelical-lutheran church, remains the people's church and is as such supported by the state. ... All religions shall be supported on equal terms."" Lutheranism was from 1536 to 2012 the public religion in Norway. This is no longer the case. Priests are no longer civil servants. This is in fact a small revolution that the church is separated from the government, it has been a long and (for some) a painful process. While the church of Norway by tradition and size has a special status is clear, but in Norway it is widely agreed that there is no more a state religion in the country. — ''''

<user_id=Wtmitchell>
The lead sentence of this article defines the term ''State religion'' for purposes of this article. That definition currently reads:
As I read your translation of Article 16 of Norway's constitution above and the translation here, which reads:
the Church of Norway falls within this article's definition of the term ''State religion'' in Norway.    (earlier ''Boracay Bill'')

<user_id=Erik den yngre>
Yes, this a bit odd. One translation uses ""established church"" (a concept that does not make any sense in Norwegian), while the original actually says ""people's church"" (""folkekirke"", ""folk"" means ""people"" or ""popular""). The lead of the present article is quite vague ""officially endorsed by the state"". In Norway, Sweden and Denmark the previous state churches have gone through a process of disestablishment. The church and the state was one for 500 years, now the separation is definite. It is puzzling to see that these profound changes are not reflected in the article. The term ""folkekirke"" (""people's church"") is intentionally vague and was added as a political compromise to satisfy the traditionalists and the christian party, it does not have any practical significance. The original 1814 constitution stated ""Den evangelisk-lutherske Religion forbliver Statens offentlige Religion."" (""Lutheranism is the public religion of the state""), jews, jesuits and monks were at the same time banned from the land. The ban on jews and monks was removed after some years, then in 2012 the words ""public religion"" was finally removed from the constitution. There is no more a public (or state) religion in Norway. — ''''

<user_id=Erik den yngre>
The church itself said in 2012: Den norske kirke kan derfor ikke lenger betegnes «statskirken». (""The church of Norway can no longer be labeled the 'state church'."") — ''''

<user_id=Wtmitchell>
This article currently has an empty ''Notes'' section. I suggest that for countries where the simplistic definition of ''State religion'' in the lead sentence of the article isn't up to a complex situation such as this, those countries be classified according to whatever the situation is, with an explanatory footnote being placed in the ''Notes'' section using the  and  templates.    (earlier ''Boracay Bill'')

<user_id=Erik den yngre>
Thanks. That is a good idea. The Gjønnes-commission of 2006 (also known as the State/Church commission) pointed out that there is not one single aspect that defines ""state church"", but several aspects that jointly characterizes a situation with state church, including
If there is public religion
If clergy is appointed by the government
If doctrine is matter for the government
If the church is governed by state legislation
If the church is publicly funded
If the church is an independent legal entity (""incorporated"") or branch of the government apparatus
In Norway, only # 5 remains, and to some degree # 4, but # 4 will change as a consequence of # 6. — ''''

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Understanding of the Topic**: Both users, Erik den yngre and Wtmitchell, demonstrate a clear understanding of the topic at hand, which is the relationship between the state and the Lutheran Church in Nordic countries. They both reference constitutional articles and historical context, indicating a good grasp of the subject matter.

2. **Use of Evidence**: Erik den yngre provides specific constitutional references (e.g., Article 16 in Norway's constitution) and historical context (e.g., the period from 1536 to 2012) to support his argument that the Lutheran Church is no longer the state religion in Norway. Wtmitchell requests clarification and suggests that the situation might still fit within the article's definition of a state religion.

3. **Clarity and Coherence**: The arguments are presented in a clear and coherent manner. Both participants articulate their points well, and the discussion progresses logically from the general status of the church to specific constitutional changes.

4. **Relevance**: The points raised are relevant to the discussion about whether the Lutheran Church should still be considered a state religion in the context of the Wikipedia article. The debate centers around the interpretation of constitutional text and the practical implications of the church-state relationship.

5. **Factual Accuracy**: The participants cite actual constitutional text and historical events, which adds to the factual accuracy of the discussion. Erik den yngre also references the Gjønnes-commission of 2006, which provides a framework for understanding what constitutes a state church.

6. **Rhetorical Strategies**: The participants use a mix of logical reasoning and appeals to authority (e.g., constitutional text, church statements, and commission findings) to make their points. There is no evidence of fallacious arguments or personal attacks, which contributes to a high-quality discussion.

7. **Constructiveness**: The discussion is constructive, with Wtmitchill suggesting a practical solution to the issue by recommending the use of footnotes for complex situations. This indicates a willingness to find common ground and improve the article collaboratively.

8. **Respect for Opposing Views**: Both users show respect for each other's views. There is no hostility or dismissiveness, and both are focused on arriving at the most accurate representation of the facts for the Wikipedia article.

Overall, the discussion is informative, well-reasoned, and focused on improving the content of the Wikipedia article in question. Both participants contribute valuable insights and demonstrate a collaborative approach to resolving the issue.

It's easy to realize that Russia page has been changed in the wrong way. Italy  article (you can see it clicking on Italy)shows Italy with a nominal gdp of 2,171 trillions $ while Russia has only 2,092 trillions $ according to IMF April data.So Italy is the tru 8th and Russia is only 9th.I suggest as soon as possible administrators to reset 9th aside russian nominal gdp as ranking.I even saw 87.... opinion that supported 151.... opinion was deleted in a vandalic way by somebody.Other people i think like 87.... will arrive above all from Italy to tell to administrators about this huge mistake(in fact it regards 2 articles both locked).

It's 9th largest based on 2014 data, but 2014 data is estimated (c'mon, there's still half the year left) and estimates like that are not typically used for ranking.

<user_id=204.15.111.27>
'Today your ip is 151.40.12.61, yesterday you were 151.40.45.125 and the day before you were 151.40.13.161''. All your comments are anti Russia, everyone. You appear to be in this mode to disagree with facts and make hearsay things.

<user_id=204.15.111.27>
Your wrong, dead wrong on the GDP. I forwarded the facts and you change ip's and say the same things over and over. Russia is 5th GDP, the list of information is above.

<user_id=Iryna Harpy>
, do not use edit summaries to challenge editors on your purported 'crusade' against the reliability of the IMF for financial statistics. In the first instance, as already noted to you, it is used consistently throughout all articles for countries in Wikipedia. In the second instance, why have you chosen this as the ''only'' article to challenge use of IMF stats rather than have it discussed via an RS/N for the sake of parity? In the third place, abide by WP:BRD. It does not mean BOLD → DELETE → REVERT → REVERT x ''ad infinitum''. What you are engaging in is WP:TE and treating the article as a WP:BATTLEFIELD.

<user_id=Crossswords>
You cant prove why IMF should only be used, IMF data is outdated because they use an outdated PPP conversion rate from 2004 vs 2011 from WB

<user_id=TaivoLinguist>
Wikipedia uses the IMF because it is standardized across all entries.  This is not the place to be pushing either a pro-Russian or anti-IMF POV.

Italy  as you can see is ranked 8th with 2,171 trillions by NOMINAL GDP . Russia  is ranked like Italy 8th but Russia is only 9th with 2,092 according to IMF data.Around 1 month ago Russia was ranked in the right way 9th ,but somebody unlocked the article and posted 8th.All people that read IMF data know  that in 2014 IMF sets Italy 8th and Russia 9th.I don't know why administrators or editors don't set Russia 9th as NOMINAL gdp in 2014.For all states (  USA , UK  and so on ...) must be used the same criteria.Russia article doesn't respect Wikipedia english criteria.Russia isn't 8th  as nominal gdp in 2014 as reported in the article .Russia is 9th because Italy is 8th.This article must be corrected because is denying the EVIDENCE.The rest (Russia 8th as nominal gdp in 2014 as article reports) is rubbish.

<user_id=151.40.117.74>
I doubt that nobody noticed what i wrote....above all the same people that unlocked article and wrote 8th about the NOMINAL russian gdp...Russia is only 9th behind Italy.I'm surprised by Wikipedia that doesn't act on these HUGE mistakes in Russia presentation and aside close the 2,092 data.Really a not high level situation.To ignore is sign of strong weakness.

Aside from acquainting yourself with the concept of an oxymoron, please pay attention to the talk page guidelines (located conveniently at the very top of the page). Which part of NOT A FORUM or POV platform do you not understand?

<user_id=151.40.123.202>
First of all avoid personal attacks like oxymoron or similar ones.I don't like personal attacks ,i like to show the mistakes in this article.You are using form but the reality is that Russia is 9th behind Italy as nominal gdp in 2014 according to IMF.

<user_id=151.40.123.202>
I know that is isn't forum ( i even wrote in main articles in Wikipedia english) and it seems you realized that there is the mistake about Russia 8th as nominal gdp,but here people are ignoring a STATEMENT with reliable and official sources http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/weodata/weorept.aspx THIS POST TALKS MORE MANY BLA BLA BLA .TIME TO UPDATE.Russia wants always a ""particular"" good treatment in several articles ,time to end this in Wikipedia.Russia is 9th as nominal gdp in 2014 IMF data.I wouldn't like to see bad feith in editors or aministrators in ignoring or misunderstanding.Wikipedia main lines  suggest good faith (or are they just a spot?).That's all, Russia article can stay also in this rubbish situation (people reading article and talk will reflect),people that know economy like me and the majority of them will survive even without the wrong article of Russia in Wikipedia))).In all this (Russia 8th ranking as nominal gdp in 2014 posted in the article presentation and aside with other data) there's more than something shenanigan.Russia as you can read in my post of the OFFICIAL SITE OF IMF IN 2014 is just 9TH BEHIND  ITALY  as NOMINAL GDP.I guess next times will arrive the writing of a PRO russian attacking me with all means he can but without talking about the REAL NUMBERS because he can nothing against REALITY.NEUTRAL REALITY is what i posted and is NAMED IMF DATA.

<user_id=Sergecross73>
No offense, but I really think you need to brush up on your English and start assuming good faith. Just as ""dead wrong"" is not a personal attack, as you complained in the past, but ""oxymoron"" is not a personal attack, but rather a term used to point out contradictions. Also, another final warning about complaining about things being pro/anti/bias/propaganda for certain countries or in going to start blocking your IPs again. Keep to the topic at hand, not those disruptive bad faith assumptions.

<user_id=151.40.120.34>
And what about the mistakes in Russia article?Russia must be ranked 9th as nominal gdp according to IMF as i posted.Let's talk about the quid that is ignored.I'm not interested in the form,i'm intersted in changing the wrong Russia ranking about nominal gdp in the presentation and aside close 2092.

<user_id=Sergecross73>
I'm not sure which is right, but I know that, when there are disputes, they are solved by coming to a consensus, and it doesn't appear that you've been able to really persuade anyone yet. I don't know if you're wrong, or you need to explain it differently.

<user_id=151.40.120.34>
Consensus can be on politic sources for articles like Potential superpower ,but here we have official data from IMF.Consensus doesn't need on official numbers.We have ITALY  ranked 8th with 2171 and  RUSSIA  ranked 8th with 2092.That's no possible.EVIDENCE of mistakes in Russia article is ENORMOUS.Before (no more than 3 months ago) Russia was ranked 9th in the right way and somebody changed it to 8th .Where did he/she get  the consensus in the Talk page to change Russia ranking from 9th to 8th?So you ask me to have something that others hadn't.I want an explanation please.A redde rationem in latin.

<user_id=151.40.120.34>
The only source is IMF data of April 2014.People are talking about  GDP PPP ,while i'm referring to NOMINAL GDP as i wrote at the beginning.All nations are ranked by these data.Russia is the only one to do not respect the standard criteria (WHY???????).Russia is 9th according to official Wikipedia standards based on IMF 2014 April data.I'm clear.Somebody unlocked and posted Russia 8th as nominal gdp in the presentation and close 2092 without  writing in the Talk less than 3 months ago.So NO CONSENSUS  for the WRONG data that are in the article. It's time to check all this by administrators.

<user_id=Sergecross73>
It appears others are citing a different source/interpretation, correct? Do you understand their point of view? Try to understand what they're saying to you. If you do, it may help you understand how to convince them of your point of view (or understand that you are mistaken. It could be either. All I know is you saying the same thing over and over doesn't seem to be working.)

<user_id=Sergecross73>
You didn't understand the matter in its main points.

<user_id=Sergecross73>
Alright, it seems you're incapable or unwilling to see or explain the other side. Can someone else explain the opposition for me then? ? ?

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. The main point of contention in the discussion is whether Russia should be ranked 8th or 9th in terms of nominal GDP according to the IMF data from April 2014. Multiple users are arguing about the correct ranking, with some citing IMF data and others citing different sources or interpretations of the data.

2. User 151.40.120.34 and others with similar IP addresses are consistently arguing that Russia should be ranked 9th based on the IMF data they are referencing. They are adamant that the current ranking of Russia as 8th is incorrect and are requesting a correction.

3. User 204.15.111.27 and others are arguing that Russia is the 5th largest economy, citing various sources that discuss Russia's GDP at Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), which is different from nominal GDP.

4. There is confusion and conflation between GDP (nominal) and GDP (PPP), which are two different measures. Some users are discussing nominal GDP while others are discussing GDP at PPP, leading to a lack of clarity in the arguments.

5. The discussion is becoming heated, with accusations of bias and propaganda. There are also personal attacks and a lack of civility, which detracts from the quality of the discussion.

6. There is a lack of consensus-building, with users repeating their points without engaging with the counterarguments presented by others. This indicates a breakdown in the discussion process.

7. Some users are attempting to bring the discussion back to policy and guidelines, emphasizing the need for standardized sources across Wikipedia entries and discouraging the use of the talk page as a forum for pushing personal viewpoints.

8. The discussion lacks a clear resolution, with no agreement on the correct data or how to interpret the sources. There is also a lack of effective moderation to guide the discussion towards a productive outcome.

Based on the above points, the discussion is marked by a lack of clarity, repeated arguments without progress, and a failure to engage constructively with opposing viewpoints. The presence of personal attacks and a breakdown in civility further reduce the quality of the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 3.5",3.5

It's referenced by a reliable source.  Please see WP:VERIFY.  The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability over truth.  Keep removing it, , and you will end up getting reported for edit warring.  Your choice.   ●

<user_id=Bob Caldwell CSL>
I am in partial agreement with  regarding sources for things like the OBE. Stories that appear in much of the news media within the first couple of days after an event like this are forced to rely on information that has not yet had time to be properly researched. Sometime, their information comes (uncredited) from other news agencies so they all end up saying the same thing, true or not. If the first news source got the OBE information from Munroe's web-site or even from Wikipedia (irony of ironies), then everyone will report it, since it's not a critical fact. So, I think it is wise to be slow to put these things into a page. That said, I do like the most recent source cited.

<user_id=Winkelvi>
I searched specifically for a UK source.  In fact, that particular source publishes recipients of the OBE year-to-year.  It's already a reliable source (Fox News Latino is a reliable source as well, most certainly).  It's coming from two reliable sources - one in the UK - and we have no way of knowing where they go their information.  To think they got what they've written from Wikipedia is using pure speculation and probably falls under WP:CRYSTAL to some degree.  That said, if it's reported in a reliable source, then it's valid for inclusion.  I see no reason to remove the OBE content in the article considering the fact that we now have two reliable sources supporting the inclusion of it.   ●

<user_id=VoiceOfreason>
I found lists of recipients on several websites but no reference of this man on any of them so I have to conclude that the original mentions of him on the news sites (hardly authorities in and of themselves) were likely pulled from Wikipedia. Yes, quite ironic. Calling a main stream media outlet (of any color) a ""reference"" is quite the stretch in my mind.voiceofreason — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

<user_id=Winkelvi>
, please familiarize yourself with what is considered a reliable source in Wikipedia and what is not.  While you, as an individual, can make conclusions on where sources get their information, putting your conclusions into article content is WP:CRYSTAL and WP:SYNTH, equating original research.  None of which is allowable in the course of editing Wikipedia.   ●

<user_id=VoiceOfreason>
Here is the list of recipients in 1998 and his name is not one of them so let's put it to bed that he did not receive it: http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/queens-birthday-honours-1998-1164586.htmlvoiceofreason

<user_id=Winkelvi>
You're trying to prove a negative with an online newspaper?  I hardly think an online publication is the definitive source for those receiving any honors.  We'd need something more reputable and infallible to prove he was NOT given the OBE in 1998 (or any year, for that matter).   ●

<user_id=VoiceOfreason>
I provided a list of all the winners but that's not good enough for you? Wow! Okay, I'm done.voiceofreason   — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

",1,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. User VoiceOfreason begins by questioning the veracity of an OBE citation for an individual, stating that they could not find evidence of the award and thus removed references to it. This is a reasonable approach, as Wikipedia relies on verifiable sources.

2. VoiceOfreason then dismisses a citation from ""Fox news latino"" as insufficient proof, which is a fair point if the citation does not meet Wikipedia's standards for reliability and verification.

3. User Winkelvi counters by emphasizing Wikipedia's policy on verifiability over truth and warns against edit warring. Winkelvi also mentions finding a UK source that publishes OBE recipients, which should add credibility to the claim.

4. User Bob Caldwell CSL provides a nuanced view, acknowledging the potential for early news reports to be inaccurate but also recognizing the value of the most recent source cited by Winkelvi.

5. VoiceOfreason expresses skepticism about mainstream media outlets as references and insists on finding no evidence of the award in official lists, which is a strong argument if the lists are indeed comprehensive and authoritative.

6. Winkelvi argues that an online newspaper may not be the definitive source for honors and suggests that more reputable and infallible proof is needed to conclusively prove the absence of an award.

7. VoiceOfreason provides a list from a reputable source (The Independent) of all the winners for a specific year, arguing that this should be sufficient to prove the individual did not receive the OBE.

The discussion shows a back-and-forth between the need for reliable verification and the challenge of proving a negative (that someone did not receive an award). Both sides present reasonable arguments: VoiceOfreason is focused on ensuring that only verified information is included, while Winkelvi is concerned with adhering to Wikipedia's policies and not dismissing potentially reliable sources without due consideration.

The quality of the discussion is relatively high, as both parties are engaged in a substantive debate about Wikipedia's standards and the reliability of sources. However, the discussion could be improved with a more collaborative approach to verifying the information in question, perhaps by seeking additional sources or consulting official records.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

Suspicious edit

<user_id=My very best wishes>
Here. Looking at English language sources, I only found this, a suspicious source. It refers to this, but info is not there. I think this should be reverted.

<user_id=Stickee>
Yeah, and most of those are 2 or 3 months old (press release is from July). Now that Malaysia has joined the JIT, most of that is irrelevant now.

<user_id=My very best wishes>
In addition, this is a common practice not to disclose results of ungoing criminal investigations. Let's not present this as a conspiracy.

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
Yep.

<user_id=My very best wishes>
Watch out. There are other similar accounts.

<user_id=USchick>
Before we start removing sourced content, would anyone like to discredit the sources first? Nederlandse Omroep Stichting NOS is one of those sources. What makes it unreliable?

<user_id=108.245.90.38>
The source is Nederlandse Omroep Stichting, what makes it unreliable?

<user_id=Antonioptg>
And De Telegraaf ""is the largest Dutch daily morning newspaper""

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
The whole edit involves trying to suggest some conspiracy to hide info wheras in fact what's happening is standard procedure in international investigations.

<user_id=Antonioptg>
It's not a standard procedure the right of veto to the publication of results of the investigation and the secrecy about the terms of the agreement.

<user_id=Herzen>
You and My very best wishes continue to engage in deception and making stuff up. At 01:39, Mvbw wrote ""this is a common practice not to disclose results of ungoing criminal investigation."" Mvbw is also an expert at insulting other editors' intelligence. What members of the Dutch parliament were asking was ''not'' the ""disclos[ure of] results of [an] ungoing criminal investigation, but ""to make public all the documents of the secret treaty."" When some editors do virtually nothing but engage in distortion and misrepresentation to game the system, it is very difficult for editors who want to introduce some semblance of NPOV into the article to make any progress. And you repeat the distortion made by your tag-teaming buddy. Finally the title of this Talk section is a personal attack. –

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
Source says it's common practice. Stop making personal attacks. The article is mostly NPOV now, it's SPA's such as the newest one, Antonioptg who continuously make bad faithed efforts to try and slant this article in a POV direction. And you've been trying to enable them throughout.

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
From the source ''""Dergelijke afspraken worden vaker gemaakt in internationale onderzoeken waarin gevoelige informatie van bijvoorbeeld inlichtingendiensten wordt gedeeld.""''. You've basically tried to cram into the articles two whole paragraph on what is essentially a conspiracy theory. No.

<user_id=Herzen>
That such agreements are common practice (and I'm not sure whether that's true) does not mean that members of the Dutch parliament have a right to see the agreement. Also, for all we know, some provisions of the agreement may not be common practice. –

<user_id=Herzen>
Whether it's common practice has nothing to do with the fact that you and Mvbw misrepresented what the parliamentarians asked for, so I did not engage in any personal attacks, but accurately described what you and Mvbw did. You continue to engage in obfuscation, bringing up the ""common practice"" point here. –

<user_id=Antonioptg>
Please, stop making personal attacks accusing me of bad faith! ""deelnemende landen het recht houden om onderzoeksresultaten geheim te houden"" = ""paertecipaten country retain the right to keep secret research results (onderzoeksresultaten)"" De Telegraaf De Telegraaf

<user_id=USchick>
Yes, it's common practice to have secret agreements during an investigation, just like it's common practice to withhold evidence, like the US is doing. It's very common to manipulate an investigation when you want a certain outcome at the end. Reliable sources are reporting that this is happening in this investigation. What's the problem with saying it in the article? This is not a theory, it's happening.

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
Yes and ''""Dergelijke afspraken worden vaker gemaakt in internationale onderzoeken waarin gevoelige informatie van bijvoorbeeld inlichtingendiensten wordt gedeeld.""''. Herzen, nobody misrepresented anything, except possibly Antonioptg who's cherry picked info from a source (in another edit).

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
This ""news"" appeared on the conspiracy website globalresearch then soon after it popped up right here. It's pushing a conspiracy POV, plain and simple.

<user_id=USchick>
The sources have been named and not refuted yet. A lot of personal attacks are flying around, but no one is bothering to discredit the two sources.

<user_id=Antonioptg>
Nothing out of the ordinary? And what will happen if the results of the investigations will focus on one of the countries involved in the secret deal? In Italy we are still waiting to know the truth about Aerolinee Itavia Flight 870!

What does 870 have to do with this? And thank you for confirming with that comment that your interest here is to spread conspiracy theories.

<user_id=USchick>
What intelligence is being shared and why is it a secret? Russian forces that aren't present in Ukraine? There are certainly no US forces in Ukraine, so what's left? Ukrainian forces?

<user_id=Arnoutf>
Ever heard of satellite images, phone taps. And how do you know there are no Russian forces on Ukraine and how comes some were arrested inside the Ukraine earlier this year? But perhaps you have access to the full deployment records and inventory of the Russian army?

<user_id=USchick>
Putin is the one asking for this information to go public and the rest of the world is hiding it.  Why is that?

<user_id=Arnoutf>
Russia is definitely not making the information public how Russian soldiers with heavy weapons could be arrested inside Ukraine earlier this year, and neither does it give full insight into its troop deployment and weapons inventory.

<user_id=USchick>
Ok, so if all sides are throwing the investigators off balance in their own propaganda war, shouldn't that be reflected in the article?

<user_id=Volunteer Marek>
WP:NOTAFORUM, also WP:NOTAFORUM and oh yeah, WP:NOTAFORUM. If you have trouble understanding that, there's also WP:NOT#FORUM. Consider also consulting WP:NOTESSAY or reading WP:NOT#ESSAY. WP:NOT#CHAT is also relevant. If all that fails to get through you might also want to look at WP:FORUM. Thanks.

<user_id=Antonioptg>
And thanks Volunteer Marek to confirm in any comments that you are not interested in writing an article NPOV but only to prevent anyone from adding information which could call into question the preconceived thesis underpinning this article. So no one can mention the existence of a secret agreement on the disclosure of the result of the investigation, nor that the Dutch Government also considers the option of ""an attack from the air"" and, if there is the official Russian version of the facts, that must be presented as ""Russia's Conspiracy Theory"". Congratulations! Good job!

<user_id=Arnoutf>
You are misrepresenting the facts. The Dutch government has ruled out mechanical failure and human error. That leaves alternatives of foreign objects entering the plane. The images are consistent with many small high speed foreign objects, that are either cannon fire or missile shrapnel. The Dutch government investigation is now trying to rule out one of those and will conclude the other must have happened. That does not mean they consider the attack from the sky idea as equally likely as the SAM theory, only that they have not  sufficient evidence to rule that out at the moment. Also there is no official Russian version, only a lot of rumormongering and speculation oh yeah and some faked images.

<user_id=Antonioptg>
So I'm misrepresenting this: ""Nu een ongeluk en een terroristische aanslag vanuit het vliegtuig onwaarschijnlijk worden geacht, blijven er twee mogelijke oorzaken over: ""een aanslag vanaf de grond dan wel een aanslag vanuit de lucht"", schrijven de ministers Opstelten, Koenders en Hennis.""; and I must have dreamed this: Special Briefing by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation on the crash of the Malaysian Boeing 777 in the Ukrainian air space, July 21, 2014.

<user_id=Arnoutf>
Actually Yes - and your own sources confirm that. The quote above fits my post exactly, but does not claim that the attack from the air is considered even closely similarly likely. The Russian statement (from 3 days after the disaster and since not substantiated by Russian officials) does not explicitly claim that it was a fighter. In fact their last para opens with the very speculative "" Is it coincidence or not?"". So again, it fits my post, but not yours. They never present their theory only speculate on possible alternatives.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The discussion begins with a user expressing concern over a suspicious edit and suggesting a reversion based on the lack of reliable sources. This is a reasonable start to the conversation, as it is important to ensure that Wikipedia content is supported by credible information.

2. Another user points out the relevance of recent developments (Malaysia joining the JIT) and suggests that much of the information in question is now irrelevant. This is a valid point that contributes to the discussion by providing context and updating the status of the information.

3. The point about common practice in criminal investigations not to disclose results is brought up to counter the suggestion of a conspiracy. This is a relevant argument that adds to the understanding of standard procedures in such cases.

4. The discussion then shifts to whether the sources cited are reliable, with users defending the credibility of Dutch sources like Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS) and De Telegraaf. This is an important aspect of the discussion, as the reliability of sources is crucial for Wikipedia's veracity.

5. The conversation becomes heated with accusations of deception and personal attacks, which detracts from the quality of the argumentation. Personal attacks are against Wikipedia's guidelines and do not contribute constructively to the discussion.

6. The argument about whether the secrecy of the agreement is standard procedure is debated, with some users providing quotes from sources to support their claims. This is a good example of using evidence to support an argument, although the context and interpretation of these quotes are contested.

7. The discussion veers into speculation about the motives behind the investigation and the involvement of various countries. While questioning motives can be part of a healthy debate, without evidence, it can also lead to the spread of conspiracy theories, which is not constructive.

8. The conversation ends with users arguing about the relevance of historical events and the current investigation's details. Some users attempt to bring the discussion back to Wikipedia's guidelines and policies, emphasizing the need for a neutral point of view and reliable sourcing.

Overall, the discussion includes some well-reasoned arguments supported by evidence and references to Wikipedia's guidelines. However, the quality of the discussion is undermined by personal attacks, speculation without evidence, and a focus on conspiracy theories rather than verifiable facts. The debate does show an effort to engage with the material and the policies of Wikipedia, but the tone and direction of the conversation at times hinder constructive dialogue.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5
"<user_id=LookingGlass>
Leading issue

<user_id=LookingGlass>
The lead (lede) paragraph of the aricle ends with the unreferenced statement:
The term neurobiology is often used interchangeably with the term neuroscience, although the former refers specifically to the biology of the nervous system.
It rests on the prior statement that neuroscience collaborates, in a way that is inferred as somehow unique, with other fields within science and elsewhere.  The statement:
it is currently an interdisciplinary science
which does not fit well with the wiki entry for the adjective interdisciplinary it is linked to
Interdisciplinarity involves the combining of two or more academic disciplines into one activity (e.g., a research project). ''et seq''
While the silos of individual disciplines is often noted, it is hard to imagine a modern field of inquiry that holds itself apart from ""collaboration"".  Easier to accept would be a statement that neuroscience is pursued in certain establishments from the outset as a joint inquiry staffed by various disciplines that work co-operatively on projects.  If the claim is that it is an
interdiscipline or an interdisciplinary field, which is an organizational unit that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, as new needs and professions emerge.
then should be stated and references for the claim provided.  However the biggest issue for me in the last sentence of the lead paragraph is its inference of the omitted word ""only"".  Biology is a vast area of enquiry.  In its most elementary sense being simply the study of life.  Innate to it is the study of biological functioning, and within this its centrality to medical science.  Mollecular biology embraces chemistry and the origin of life concerns the physics of our inert planet.  Functioning in respect of neurological inquiry concerns itself with messaging processes, transmission and receipt mechanisms and their agents of operation - chemical and physical.  IMO the sentence should simply be deleted and the lead paragraph altered to set neuroscience out as a monicker for collaborative interdisciplinary projects, with neurobiology as its natural (as opposed to artificial) academic home.  At the very least a suitably august reference is required.

<user_id=Tryptofish>
Yes, that sentence has bothered me for a long time, as it borders on being WP:OR. I just made an edit that removed the sentence entirely, and relocated ""'''neurobiology'''"" to the lead sentence. Better, I think, to keep it simple.

<user_id=Danielkueh>
Perhaps a better term is ""multidisciplinary"" rather than ""interdisciplinary,"" as described by the following sources: [], [], [], [], []. My two cents.

<user_id=Tryptofish>
That's a very good idea, thanks. I'm going to make that edit now.

<user_id=Danielkueh>
I would like to refer to the last sentence of the first lead paragraph, ""It also influences such other disciplines as neuroeducation,[9] neuroethics, and neurolaw."" I do not doubt that these fields exist. But are they so prominent and widely studied that they deserve to be mentioned in the lead, let alone the first paragraph of the lead?

<user_id=Tryptofish>
Actually, I do believe that they should remain there. They get a large amount of attention from neuroscientists in other neuroscience fields. I could cite programs from recent Society for Neuroscience meetings, where there are almost always prominent lectures about how basic neuroscience influences these fields. Would it help if I were to add some of those program entries as citations for the sentence?

<user_id=Danielkueh>
I don't doubt that these fields exist and they generate quite a bit of interest. My concern is a question of undue weight. I am not convinced that they should be featured so prominently in the first lead paragraph. Plus, the lead should summarize the body of the article and these three fields are not listed or described there. I think the lead should first describe the more fundamental aspects of neuroscience and then gradually transition to the more applied, medical, and interdisciplinary aspects of the field.

<user_id=Tryptofish>
That's a good point. The lead tries so hard to define ""neuroscience"" that it does not really provide a summary. I could imagine a complete rewrite of the lead, and moving the many disciplines, and the professional societies, to new sections of the page.

<user_id=Danielkueh>
I agree. I think there needs to be a reorganization of the lead. What changes do you have in mind?

<user_id=Tryptofish>
I don't really have any specific ideas, and am thinking out loud as I write this comment. I suppose there can be a simple definition of the word, followed by a brief statement that it is multidisciplinary, but without the long lists of disciplines. Then move those disciplines to the start of the modern neurosci section. Also move the professional societies to the section about them. Then, make the rest of the lead a summary of the page, but that's where I don't have specific ideas.

<user_id=Danielkueh>
Something like this?
First paragraph: Definition and scope
Second paragraph: History
Third paragraph: Modern neuroscience
Fourth paragraph: Major branches
Fifth paragraph: Organizations
Just an idea.

<user_id=Tryptofish>
Yes, sure, that's a reasonable start. The important thing, however, is to keep everything brief, and that might result in combining some of those paragraphs.

<user_id=Danielkueh>
I agree.

<user_id=Darwinsbulldog>
Let's be objective: neuroscience is a branch of biology, which is based on mathematics and deals with the physical and chemical properties of living organisms. Saying that neuroscience ""also draws upon fields including mathematics and physics"" is redundant and obvious just like it would be for physiology or molecular biology. Medicine is an application of biology. Writing that neuroscience draws upon medicine would like writing that electromagnetism draws upon engineering. I think that if we want, we could write that neuroscience collaborates with fields like psychology and cognitive science, but if you write that neuroscience investigates the basis of processes like cognition or behaviour it also becomes redundant.

<user_id=Looie496>
An encyclopedia article may find it useful to state something even if it is logically redundant, if the redundancy is not obvious to readers.

<user_id=Danielkueh>
We are being objective. We rely on established Wikipedia policies (WP:RS, WP:V, etc) to guide our decisions. I admit the current lead is far from perfect, but much of it is supported by reliable sources. Hence, I reverted your bold edit until we establish consensus (WP:consensus)). As to your statements and concerns:
neuroscience is a branch of biology, which is based on mathematics and deals with the physical and chemical properties of living organisms.  This is a rather idiosyncratic definition of biooogy. In any event, it has been well-established by reliable sources that neuroscience is a multidisciplinary science. Please take a gander at the sources in the lead and talk page. In fact, take a look at the table of various multidisciplinary fields.
The lead doesn't say physics and mathematics anymore.
Medicine is not just an ""application of biology."" It's a separate discipline in its own right. That analogy of electromagnetism doesn't hold.
Serious question. Is cognitive science not a subfield of psychology? Or has it truly splintered off? On a separate issue, neuroscience doesn't just collaborate with these fields. It actually incorporates or ""draws"" upon them.
I agree that the lead could be improved. But I would insist that all significant changes to the lead be consistent with reliable sources. Best.

<user_id=Sincosx>
Neuroscience is not the only discipline that collaborates with computer science so Darwinsbulldog's edit was wrong, also if the redundancy is not obvious it could be useful. Anyway, engineering too is a discipline in it's own right but it is based on physics and you don't write on the physics page that it ""draws upon"" engineering. Modern medicine is an applied science based on biology (unless you consider pseudosciences like ""homeopathy"" or ""naturopathy"" as medicine...) so I don't think that we should write on the first paragraph of the article that neuroscience draws upon medicine. Of course one of neuroscience's application is in neurology but I think that on the first part of the article we should explain what neuroscience is and not focus on listing all the other disciplines neuroscience collaborates with. I think that the former edit: '''It is a multidisciplinary branch of biology, that deals with the anatomy, biochemistry, molecular biology, and physiology of neurons and neural circuits as well as their relationship with emergent functions such as behavior, cognition and learning''' gave a better idea of what neuroscience is in the first place (as written in the Society For Neuroscience's definition) https://www.sfn.org/about/about-neuroscience

<user_id=Danielkueh>
The SfN page does not provide a simple definition of neuroscience. It briefly describes the function of the brain, its importance, and the motivation of neuroscientists. For example, it states that ""Brain researchers are motivated to understand behavior."" That's very different from saying ""....neural circuits as well as their relationship with emergent functions such as behavior, cognition and learning."" Such a statement would require a source (WP:RS) that explicitly states that. In any event, it doesn't have to come at the expense of describing the multidisciplinary nature of the field. This IS important. Neuroscientists with a psychology background will study the brain very differently from neuroscientists with a biological or computational background. Hence, there are big differences between behavioral neuroscience and neuroethology, for example. As for the statement that medicine is nothing more than an applied science based on biology, that is just simplistic and does not consider how the various fields are actually organized. For instance, it may seem on the surface that people who study the behavioral and biological aspects of human beings are biologists, but they are actually biological anthropologists. This type of arbitrary convention also applies to the organization of biology and medicine as separate disciplines. I don't doubt there is overlap, but to say one just ""applies"" the knowledge that was developed from the other is simply not true. WP's medicine page does an excellent job of explaining the field. Anyway, other editors should weigh in. Hopefully there will be consensus on a stable version for the lead.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The initial concern raised by <user_id=LookingGlass> is about the accuracy and clarity of the lead paragraph in an article, specifically regarding the terms ""neuroscience"" and ""neurobiology."" The user suggests that the statement about the interchangeability of these terms is potentially misleading and lacks proper referencing. This is a valid point, as precision and citations are crucial in an encyclopedia.

2. <user_id=Tryptofish> responds by removing the contentious sentence and simplifying the lead, which is a practical approach to resolving the issue without getting bogged down in semantics.

3. <user_id=Danielkueh> introduces the term ""multidisciplinary"" as a more accurate descriptor than ""interdisciplinary,"" and provides sources to support this change. This enhances the argument by grounding it in external references, which is a strong rhetorical strategy.

4. <user_id=Tryptofish> and <user_id=Danielkueh> then engage in a constructive dialogue about the prominence of certain fields within the lead paragraph and the overall structure of the lead. They both show a willingness to consider the balance and weight of content, which is important for neutrality and comprehensiveness.

5. <user_id=Darwinsbulldog> presents a more reductionist view of neuroscience, suggesting that it is a branch of biology and that its connections to other disciplines are either redundant or obvious. This argument is somewhat simplistic and does not fully acknowledge the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of modern scientific fields.

6. <user_id=Looie496> makes a brief but important point that redundancy can be useful for clarity to readers who may not find it obvious, which is a good reminder of the audience's perspective.

7. <user_id=Danielkueh> defends the multidisciplinary nature of neuroscience with policy-based arguments (WP:RS, WP:V, etc.), emphasizing the importance of reliable sources and consensus in Wikipedia editing. This shows a strong adherence to Wikipedia's guidelines.

8. <user_id=Sincosx> argues for a more focused definition of neuroscience, citing the Society For Neuroscience's definition. This user is advocating for clarity and specificity, which is beneficial for readers seeking a straightforward understanding of the field.

Overall, the discussion is characterized by a collaborative effort to improve the article's accuracy and clarity. The participants use a variety of rhetorical strategies, including referencing policies, citing sources, and considering the reader's perspective. The arguments are generally coherent, relevant, and show a commitment to factual accuracy.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.5",8.5

Blog posts from Open Democracy

<user_id=Absolutelypuremilk>
I removed content supported by blog posts on Open Democracy and London Review of Books. These do not seem like useful additions to the article. They don't seem to be adhering to NPOV.

<user_id=Sionk>
They are both reliable journalistic sources with an editorial team. LRB is also a printed bi-monthly magazine. Maybe you don't like their opinions, but neither are used extensively here (in contrast to some other partisan publications).

<user_id=Slatersteven>
Blogs are generally not RS unless by noted experts or as the opinion of the subject of the article. Which of these do they meet?

<user_id=Sionk>
Not sure where you got that bit of guidance from. Reliable sources are ones with a reputation for fact checking etc. If a reliable source (e.g. newspaper, magazine) publishes pieces in blog form, that doesn't make them automatically unreliable.

<user_id=Slatersteven>
True, but they have to (under those circumstances) actually be by professional journalists or are by experts in the field, ad are subject to normal editorial control. Just being hosted by a news organ is not enough. SO are they?

<user_id=Sionk>
You seem to be making this up as you go along. I've given my opinion to the OP, the removal of the content has been reverted anyway. It added a welcome, pertinent and brief response to the largely one-sided description of events.

<user_id=Slatersteven>
WP:UGC ""Some news outlets host interactive columns they call ""blogs"", and these may be acceptable as sources if the writers are professional journalists or professionals in the field on which they write, and the blog is subject to the news outlet's full editorial control. Posts left by readers may never be used as sources "".

<user_id=Tanbircdq>
I'm not aware of either publication being blogs, they're both reliable sources. They're probably not useful if the intention is to present a one-sided POV of the article, however, in order to provide balance they will be. I'm not sure how either aren't NPOV either, both have a wide range of contributors, I can't see this being any different to the left-wing ''New Statesman'', the liberal ''The Guardian'', and conservative ''The Daily Telegraph'' or ''The Spectator'' etc. RS relates to sources and POV/NPOV relates to the content anyway.
As far as I'm aware both publications are subject to editorial control. The writers who have been used here are an independent researcher, an Israeli historian and a former appeal court and ECJ judge. The content from these sources have been published in secondary sources too which have now been added to the article.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. <user_id=Absolutelypuremilk> initiates the discussion by stating that content supported by blog posts on Open Democracy and London Review of Books has been removed due to concerns about neutrality and usefulness. The argument is based on the perception that these sources may not adhere to a Neutral Point of View (NPOV).

2. <user_id=Sionk> counters by asserting that both Open Democracy and London Review of Books are reliable journalistic sources with editorial teams, and that the London Review of Books is also a printed magazine. The argument here is that the reliability of a source is determined by its reputation for fact-checking and editorial oversight, not necessarily by whether some consider its content as opinionated.

3. <user_id=Slatersteven> introduces Wikipedia's guidelines on reliable sources, specifically mentioning that blogs are generally not considered reliable unless written by noted experts or reflecting the opinion of the subject of the article. This argument is grounded in Wikipedia's policies, which aim to ensure the reliability and verifiability of sources.

4. <user_id=Sionk> challenges the interpretation of the guidelines, emphasizing that the format (blog or otherwise) does not automatically disqualify a source if it is published by a reputable organization with editorial control.

5. <user_id=Slatersteven> cites a specific Wikipedia policy (WP:UGC) to support the argument that blogs can be acceptable sources under certain conditions, such as being written by professional journalists or experts and being subject to full editorial control.

6. <user_id=Tanbircdq> argues that neither Open Democracy nor London Review of Books are considered blogs and that they are reliable sources. The user also points out that the sources in question have a range of contributors and that the content has been published in secondary sources, which adds to their credibility. The argument here is that the sources are comparable to other recognized publications with various political leanings, and that the issue at hand is about balance and neutrality in the article content.

Overall, the discussion involves a mix of subjective assessments of source reliability and interpretations of Wikipedia's guidelines. The participants provide reasoned arguments, reference Wikipedia's policies, and discuss the importance of editorial control and the credentials of the authors contributing to the sources in question. The discussion remains civil and focused on the topic, with each participant contributing to a nuanced understanding of what constitutes a reliable source within the context of Wikipedia.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5
"<user_id=D.Lazard>
Elementary proof

<user_id=D.Lazard>
I have replaced section ""Motivation"" (which I have added myself to the article) by a section ""Elementary proof"". Here is the rationale.
I have been confused by the old version the article, and by the whole discussion, which suggested that the article was about infinite objects (infinite decimal representation). This confusion was supported by the algebraic pseudo proofs, which consist of manipulating infinite objects, without defining them neither the operations that are available for them. I have thus introduced the motivation for trying to explain why it is relevant to consider these object.
Presently, we have an accurate definition of 0.999..., which is conform with the history of the notation, and it appears that one does not need to manipulate infinite objects for proving 0.999... = 1. Therefore, this section ""Motivation"" seems unneeded.
On the other hand, the article deserves to have an elementary proof of this equality. By elementary, I mean using only properties of  and the operations of (finite) decimal numbers. This is such a proof, which is the object of this new section. This proof is very simple, and is also simple to explain, even to young kids, by a drawing on the number line. , could you adapt to this the file that I have kept.
I apologise that I have no source for this proof. It is so easy that I am pretty sure that such a source exists. In any case the algebraic pseudo-proofs are not sourced either.
It is amazing that so many people have discussed on 0.999... = 1 and the way to present this equality to kids, without realizing that it is easy to prove it without any reference to any calculus concept.

<user_id=Calbaer>
That's much better than what it replaces, which I had a lot of problems with.  It might be somewhat daunting to some people - kicking off the article with a rigorous proof relying on a analytical property you don't prove, but instead link to - but it's a significant improvement nonetheless.  You are correct to fear an objection on the grounds of original research, but I wouldn't challenge it on those grounds.  I disagree that it doesn't rely on real analysis, since it assumes that no number is smaller than the inverse of an integer.  That's something that anyone accustomed to such proofs would take as a given, but doubters might not.  Nonetheless, I changed the portion about what's required for formal proof to say, ""such as rigorous proofs relying on non-elementary techniques, properties, and/or disciplines"" rather than mentioning real analysis specifically.

<user_id=JohnBlackburne>
The article now is in a far worse state than a month ago. Previously it started with the most elementary of proofs, ones you might encounter in high school and which require only a knowledge of recurring decimals. But now the first proof is a far more advanced one, using notation and a degree of formalism not encountered until university. This makes the article far less accessible than it was. As I noted a week ago, it’s important this article is accessible as possible, as one of the few mathematical FA, on a topic easily understood by someone with high-school mathematics.

<user_id=DVdm>
This ""elementary proof"" is unsourced, so it should be removed per wp:NOR. With a source, it is welcome. I also think that all the unsourced algebraic pseudo-proofs should either be backed by a solid source, or removed. Failing that, this discussion will ''never'' end. -

<user_id=Sławomir Biały>
The algebraic pseudoproofs appear in the sources cited in the discussion, by Richman, Byers, and Peressini and Peressini.  However, as I have said in the RfC, the section does not currently neutrally summarize those sources.

<user_id=DVdm>
Ah yes, indeed, sorry. Could you try to create a few inline citations and stick them somewhere? TIA.

<user_id=DVdm>
Of course, that other new section still ''really'' needs a solid source. -

<user_id=Sławomir Biały>
Surely the section on ""Algebraic proofs"" cannot possibly count as proofs without some version of the Archimedean property.  I'm all for making the article as accessible as possible, but not at the expense of obscuring the most important aspects of the subject.

<user_id=Dmcq>
The paper Does 0.999… Really Equal 1? is fairly close in structure to this article. It gives a proof but only mentions that it used the Archimedean property a bit later. I agree that using the Archimedean property is a better route rather than going through the completeness property of the reals even though some people derive the Archimedean property from the completeness.

<user_id=Sławomir Biały>
Yes, that seems closer to the original structure.  However, I note that here (as in other such sources) the elementary proofs are not presented as altogether convincing.  (""maybe 0.333... doesn't equal 1/3"", ""skeptics might reject the equality by claiming that not all numbers can be subtracted from one another!"")  He clearly presents the resolution of such apparent paradoxes by giving 0.999... a meaning as a limit.  Also, it seems to me that completeness cannot be totally omitted from the discussion, since it is completeness that ensures that the notation ""0.999..."" is meaningful as a number.  I note that some editors have been waving the ""repeating decimals"" magic wand (notably JohnBlackburne and Trovatore), but I am uncertain what repeating decimals means to them if not via limits and completeness.  I have concerns that completeness is also foregone in the new ""Elementary proof"" section.  There are algorithms for constructing rational numbers from repeating decimals, but the ""Algebraic arguments"" make no reference to these algorithms.  (And indeed, there is actually nothing to prove in that case:  is simply true by definition.)

<user_id=Calbaer>
I don't think any proof can be skeptic-proof; as I noted, the new proof requires one to buy that there's no positive number less than 1/x for all integers.  I'm reminded of skeptics talking about the mythical 0.000...1, being convinced that 1-0.999.. is that number, an infinite number of 0s followed by a 1, which presumably would be less than any 1/x.  Most other people don't seem to have a problem 0.333... = 1/3, so that demonstration helps bridge a gap for some people, even as if leaves other gaps open (i.e., assumed non-axiomatic properties).  In spite of the improvements of the past few days, I agree with JohnBlackburne that the article is in a worse state than a month ago.  I'm hoping that this is just a matter of transition, though.
Not using the word ""proofs"" for the series of equations at 0.999...#Algebraic proofs is one thing.  But leaving them until after a formal proof (deceptively called ""elementary,"" as though it's easier to understand than those in 0.999...#Algebraic proofs) or a discussion of a tangentially related philosophical problem of Achilles and the tortoise is going to lose people.  (I call the now-removed tortoise section ""tangentially related"" because of its many differences: twos instead of tens, a moving target instead of a stationary target, and physics/philosophy versus pure math.)  The only question is how many people we'll lose.  It might be worthwhile to leave up the section to satisfy those who believe it's important and to see what type of reaction we get for it.  I think it's interesting, but the OR and readability concerns remain.  (And ""original research"" isn't just an arbitrary concern; if no one else has used this to bridge understanding, there might be a reason.  After all, we're coming from the other side of understanding, trying to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who doesn't buy 0.999...=1, which is a different position than a math educator who has to deal with this problem all the time.)

<user_id=Sławomir Biały>
Except the algebraic proofs don't actually prove the theorem, which is that one is the smallest number greater than all of the finite truncations 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc.  In this respect, they are manifestly deficient.  If anyone wants to clarify what actually is proven by the algebraic proofs, I would be happy to comment at greater length.

<user_id=D.Lazard>
For those who find that the elementary proof is too difficult, I have split this section into two subsections ""intuitive explanation"" and ""formal proof"". This allows the reader, who does not really care of proofs, skipping  the formal proof. Although this is not the objective of this article, this may allow also helping some reader to better understand the difference between a proof and an explanation.

",0,"The discussion revolves around the inclusion of an ""elementary proof"" for the mathematical concept that 0.999... equals 1 in a Wikipedia article. The participants are debating the appropriateness, accessibility, and sourcing of the proof, as well as the overall structure of the article.

1. D.Lazard introduces an ""elementary proof"" to the article, arguing that it is simple and can be explained to young kids. They believe that the proof does not require manipulation of infinite objects and thus simplifies the concept. However, they acknowledge the lack of a source for this proof.

2. Calbaer supports the change but points out that the proof assumes a mathematical property (no number is smaller than the inverse of an integer) that may not be evident to all readers. They suggest a slight modification to the language to make it more inclusive of various proof techniques.

3. JohnBlackburne criticizes the new proof for being too advanced and formal, making the article less accessible to readers with only high-school mathematics knowledge.

4. DVdm insists on the need for a source for the new proof, in line with Wikipedia's no original research policy, and suggests that all unsourced content should be removed or properly cited.

5. Sławomir Biały points out that the algebraic pseudoproofs are sourced in the discussion, but the article does not neutrally summarize those sources. They also express concern that the new proof may omit the importance of the Archimedean property.

6. Dmcq suggests that the structure of the article should be similar to a paper that presents a proof and then discusses the Archimedean property, arguing that this approach is more accessible.

7. Calbaer reiterates concerns about the new proof's accessibility and the potential loss of readers due to the formal approach. They also question the removal of a section that provided a philosophical context.

8. Sławomir Biały further elaborates on the deficiencies of the algebraic proofs in proving the theorem and the importance of completeness in the discussion.

9. D.Lazard responds to the concerns about the difficulty of the proof by splitting the section into an ""intuitive explanation"" and a ""formal proof,"" allowing readers to skip the formal proof if they wish.

The quality of the arguments presented in this discussion is generally high. The participants are knowledgeable about the subject matter and are concerned with both the factual accuracy and the pedagogical effectiveness of the article. They are also aware of Wikipedia's policies regarding original research and sourcing. The discussion is coherent, with each participant building on the points raised by others, and there is a clear effort to reach a consensus that balances the needs of different readers.

However, there are some gaps in the discussion. For example, there is a lack of consensus on what constitutes an ""elementary proof"" and whether the proposed proof meets this criterion. Additionally, while the need for sourcing is mentioned, there is no clear resolution on how to address the unsourced content.

Overall, the discussion is constructive, with participants providing reasoned arguments and showing a willingness to consider different perspectives. Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 8.",8.0
"<user_id=Nicknack009>
I've added a ""disputed section"" tag to the Pre-history section, because it, factually, nonsense. The Ulster Cycle is a body of legends with no value as history, and its chronological setting is probably the least historical thing about it, as discussed in the medieval literature section below. Nobody thinks the Táin Bó Cúailnge actually happened, and nobody thinks it happened in the 1st century. Our only historical information as to the political breakdown of pre-historic Ireland is Ptolemy in the 2nd century, who names a population group that can be possibly identified as the ancestor of the Ulaid, but bears no resemblance to the legendary Pentarchy.  Equally, the political breakdown at the dawn of history in the 5th century, as reconstructed from the annals, bears no relation to the Pentarchy.
I'm going to have a go at rewriting this section from scratch, but it'll take me some time to gather my sources. In the meantime, this should stand to explain why the disputed tag is there.

<user_id=Nicknack009>
Disputed section

<user_id=Nicknack009>
On second thoughts, I've taken the stuff about the Pentarchy and moved it to the medieval literature section, and removed the rest of the Pre-history section, as all that's left is the claim that the Ulster Cycle gives information on the pre-history of the Ulaid, which it doesn't. If I can work up something accurate and sourced about the pre-history of the Ulaid I'll add it later.

<user_id=Mabuska>
Firstly it is a work in progress and the stuff at the start was simply a temporary filler. I didn't feel comfortable with it and it was to be re-written and expanded upon. Though the Ulster Cycle does give information on Ulaid (obviously only in terms of mythology) in regards to the alleged political make-up of Ireland, that is its division into five kingdoms and the lack of mention of any form of central monarchy. The 1st century part is only a claim and is sourced so obviously there are people who believed that may have been the time it occurred. Nowhere did it state that it was fact.

<user_id=Mabuska>
Seeing as this article isn't about the provinces of Ireland there is no need to delve into the pseudo-history/mythology of the Pentarchy, however obviously it doesn't bear any resemblance to the political breakdown of Ireland in the 5th century because it was long gone by that stage. The process of it disappearing is also in Irish mythology in the forms of Túathal Techtmar and Niall of the Nine Hostages, which according to legend came before the 5th century and altered the political face of Ireland. Did you never wonder why some believe that Ireland was anciently divided into five provinces despite the fact at the dawn of recorded history, Ireland was split into at least seven? And on seven, I'll not even go into Keating's notions of what he called the ""Septarchy"".
You should read Eoin MacNeill's ""The Five Fifths of Ireland"", where he goes on a good bit about the legendary Pentarchy and its references in the Annals and mythology. Hogan and Hurbert also make mention of it and its constituents. Obviously their sources are pseudo-historians writting centuries after the events so we clearly can't accept any of it as set in stone fact. Yet that doesn't mean we can't include it, as long as we word it so that its clear it is not fact.

<user_id=Mabuska>
Just to note, the Pentarchy stuff does fit in better in the literature section.

<user_id=Nicknack009>
I don't think we're very far apart. My objections are to saying that the Ulster Cycle gives us any information on the pre-history of the Ulaid (it can only give is information on what people in the middle ages ''thought'' was the pre-history of the Ulaid, and we can see what people thought changing over time), and to the following sentence:
The principle story of the Ulster Cycle the Táin Bó Cúailnge was set during the reign of Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulaid, and is believed to have happened in the 1st century.[14]
Particularly the end of it. It would be defensible to say it ''was'' believed to have happened in the 1st century, but not that it ''is'' believed to have happened, which suggests (a) that this particular story is believed to have happened, and (b) the 1st century chronology for its setting, the Pentarchy etc, is accurate. I believe there was, at some point, either a pentarchy or the ideal of a pentarchy - hence the name ''cuige'', fifth, for the Irish provinces even though there's only four of them. But Ptolemy, writing in the 2nd century, shows it can't have gone back as far as the 1st. It probably existed not long before the time of St Patrick and Niall Noigiallach, fourth or at a stretch third century at the very earliest, and from what I've read I'd be surprised if MacNeill would say different.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. User Nicknack009 raises concerns about the historical accuracy of the Pre-history section related to the Ulster Cycle and the Pentarchy. They argue that the Ulster Cycle is a body of legends and has no historical value, and that the chronological setting is not based on historical fact.

2. User Nicknack009 also points out that the political breakdown of pre-historic Ireland as described does not match historical records from Ptolemy or the annals from the 5th century.

3. User Mabuska responds by acknowledging that the section was a work in progress and meant to be temporary. They also argue that while the Ulster Cycle is mythological, it does provide some insight into the mythology of the political makeup of Ireland.

4. User Mabuska further explains that the Pentarchy is part of Irish mythology and that historical records from the dawn of recorded history show a different political structure, suggesting that the Pentarchy had disappeared by then.

5. User Nicknack009 clarifies their position, emphasizing the difference between what is believed and what is historically accurate. They also express openness to the idea that there may have been a pentarchy or the ideal of one at some point in history.

Is there a reference for Naresuan bearing this title?

<user_id=RJFF>
Emperor of Lan Na?

<user_id=RJFF>
Hello  Do you have an opinion or idea regarding this issue? It seems illogical or at least counter-intuitive that Lan Na is supposed to have had a higher ranking ruler title than Ayutthaya at a time when the former was just a vassal state of the latter. I guess that it is supposed to refer to the claim of being ''chakravartin''. But 1) is ""Emperor"" an inaccurate translation of ''chakravartin'' and 2) did ''chakravartin'' express a ''universal'' claim to power, not a title linked to a certain realm, so ""chakravartin ''of Lan Na''"" would be self-contradictory.

<user_id=RJFF>
I have just found the same anomaly in the articles on Bayinnaung and Nanda Bayin. Perhaps  might have a say in this discussion, too? Why are they supposed to be just ""king"" of Burma, but ""emperor"" of Lan Na, Lan Xang and Siam, while Burma was indeed more powerful than Lan Na, Lan Xang and Siam at that time, and Lan Na's, Lan Xang's and Siam's rulers during independence are not referred to as ""emperors""? In English-language literature I could not find a single reference for an ""Emperor of Lan Na"". And I could only find mentions of an ""Emperor of Siam"" and ""Lan Xang"" in anachronistic or non-expert texts, and they are referring to rulers of an independent Siam or Lan Xang, not foreign rulers who exerted the overlordship over these realms.

<user_id=Iudexvivorum>
In modern usage, ''chakravartin'' is often used to refer to a ruler of an empire, as emperor of Japan, emperor of Russia, etc. I guess that's why some people used the term 'emperor' in the articles where the religious/historical ''chakravartin'' is mentioned. But the concepts of the modern and the religious/historical ''chakravartin'' are completely different. So, I don't think the term 'emperor' belongs here.
Anyway, I'm not sure if Naresuan had ever used such a title as ''chakravartin'' in relation to his control over Lan Na. Nothing about the title ''chakravartin'' is mentioned in Thai documents, including all the existing royal chronicles, as well as Prince Damrong's commentary on them (ISBN 9744171448) and biography of Naresuan (ISBN 9743238735). In 'ตำนานพื้นเมืองเชียงใหม่' (lit 'Folk History of Chiang Mai'), a historical document of Lan Na, Naresuan is referred to with the titles 'พญา' and 'พระ' (ISBN 9748150623, page 97).
The book 'ประวัติศาสตร์ล้านนา' ('History of Lan Na') by Professor สรัสวดี อ๋องสกุล (ISBN 9786161800260) may be of use. Unfortunately, I've just donated it to my univ's library, which will be closed until Tuesday due to public holiday. So, I'am unable to consult this book for the nonce.
Maybe 'overlord' is a proper term (at least better than 'emperor). This term is used in Lan Na#Burmese rule.

<user_id=Hybernator>
Hi , I can only speak for the Burmese usage. Chronicles call Bayinnaung, among his *many* other titles, ''Min Ekarit'' (Lord Emperor) of his vassal states. ''Ekarit'' (""emperor"") comes from Pali ''ekaraj'', not ''chakravartin'' (''sekkyawaday'' in Burmese.) Bayinnaung was ''ekarit'' of ''naing-ngans'' (""emperor"" of ""conquered states""). Neither he nor Nanda was ever called ""king of Lan Na/Chiang Mai"". That title, ''Zinme Bayin'' (""King of Chiang Mai""), in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, belonged to Nawrahta Minsaw. (In general, rulers of major vassal states were referred to with the title ''bayin'' (""king""). Exceptions were rulers of Mogaung, Keng Tung and Manipur, who though called ''sawbwa'' (""chief"") by the chronicles were nonetheless allowed to keep their full royal regalia.)
I don't know how Naresuan's status as the overlord of Lan Na was referred to in Thai chronicles. AFAIK, ''Chiang Mai'' and ''Nan'' chronicles don't even acknowledge that Lan Na was ever a vassal of Siam during Naresuan's reign. I believe, we'd have to look at the ''Ayutthaya'' chronicle for the usage. Our Thai editors perhaps have access to it or other sources.
Anyway, as for the usage of king vis a vis emperor, I think we have a precedent in monarchs of the Great Britain (referred to as king and queen) being referred to as the Emperor/Empress of India. Two cents.

<user_id=RJFF>
Hello  Thanks for your well-informed answer. Do modern English-language sources indeed render the native title of ''Ekarit'' as ""emperor""? Sorry for my scepticism, but I find it always problematic to translate foreign royal titles into a different language, because these titles are usually tied to a certain social and political system and do not have a simple equivalent. Translating royal titles was very common in earlier centuries, but I have the impression that modern historians tend to avoid this practice more and more. A neutral term like ""overlord"" as proposed by  (in a statement that he/she has unfortunately deleted) might be more appropriate. In fact, I had thought of the England/India example, too, once I had saved my above question. But I think there is an essential difference: India, despite being under British suzerainty, was much bigger and more populous than the British mainland. This is not the case with the Burmese vassals, that were either smaller (e.g. Lan Na), or at most, roughly equal (e.g. Ayutthaya). So I think it is still unprecedented to link a higher-ranking title to a less powerful and smaller, less populous dominion. By the way, you have written that Bayinnaung is referred to as ''Min Ekarit'' ""of his vassal states""; does that mean ''Min Ekarit'' of his vassal states ''in total'' or ''Min Ekarat'' of each of his vassal states individually, i.e. ''Min Ekarit'' of Lan Na, ''Min Ekarit'' of Lan Xang, ''Min Ekarit'' of Ayutthaya etc. I would assume the former. I do not have that much a problem with labelling Bayinnaung an ""emperor"" per se (in the sense of ruler of an ""empire"" that consists of the Burmese mainland and all of its vassal states), but I am very doubtful about labelling him ""Emperor of Lan Na"", ""Emperor of Siam"", ""Emperor of Lan Xang"" as if each of these were individual, separable titles (which I doubt).

<user_id=Hybernator>
Hi , thanks for the thoughtful comments.

<user_id=Hybernator>
In Burmese, ''ekarit'' means emperor. For more academic definitions of the term ''ekarit'' (ekaraj) in English, see:  and
The chronicles do give his multitude of titles and names of his vassal states (including those that were more likely allies or protectorates in present-day India). But if you're asking if they specifically state in the form of: ''Ekarit'' of , no. (At least I haven't seen it.) Chroniclers, I don't believe, were thinking of in such neat academic terms.
I'm not sure if there are commonly accepted criteria as to what constitutes an empire. Relatively small territories (Vietnam, Korea, Haiti) called themselves empires and their rulers emperors. Of course, even the Toungoo Empire at its height in the grand scheme of things was rather small in comparison to other large empires.
FWIW, Lan Na was considered the most important, strategic vassal state by Bayinnaung and the Pegu court. The rank of the ruler of Lan Na was ''Bayin'' (""king"") as was the case with Ayutthaya.
Now, many Burmese kings had grandiose titles that equate to emperor even if their domain was no more than a small region. They called themselves ''Min Ekarit'', ''Sekkyawaday'', ''Maha Dhamma-Yaza'', ''Maha Dhamma-Yaza-Dipadi'', ''Razadarit'' (''Yazadarit''/Yaza-di-Yaza). For example, Binnya Nwe controlled just the Pegu province at his accession but nonetheless proclaimed himself as Razadarit (king of kings; Raja-dhi-Raja). Of course, several Siamese kings also had the title ''Rachathirat''.
Overlord, to me, is a term of relative rank/position. The closest equivalent term in Burmese would be ''min'' which means lord but could refer to various office holders (governors, viceroys, or kings) or members of the royalty. A ''min'' could have vassals underneath him/her, and still have higher ranked overlords (''mins''). In the case of Burmese monarchs, they saw themselves as the top ranked ruler. (I'm sure Siamese monarchs thought the same.) So, to me, overlord doesn't fully convey the sense of the paramount ruler: king of kings.

<user_id=RJFF>
I will not try to argue with you about the translation of Burmese terms (of which you have obviously a lot of knowledge, and I have none). However, the works you have just linked to, do ''not'' translate ''ekaraj''/''Min Ekarit'' as ""emperor"", but ""sole ruler, universal monarch"" or ""Ruler and First Lord"". As long as there are no references for the titles of ""Emperor of Lan Na"", ""Emperor of Siam"", ""Emperor of Lan Xang"" (being separate titles), I think it will be best to omit them from the infobox, per WP:Verifiability and WP:NOR. Some positions or relationships are too complicated to be summarised in infoboxes. Of course, the article's bodies will still mention these rulers exerting the overlordship over the respective lands.

<user_id=Hybernator>
Well, don't take my word for it. You can ask other Burmese editors as well. Here are a few other books that translate ''ekaraja'' as sole sovereign (emperor) or universal emperor: , ;  Anyway, that's all I have to say about the topic. I don't have a strong opinion about omitting them in the infobox here. Regards,

Reasonable foresight

<user_id=128.90.93.207>
I am the IP you refer to.
I changed ""However, Judge Masipa said a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have foreseen this. In light of this, his actions were clearly negligent... ""  to ""However, Judge Masipa said his actions were clearly negligent (for example in failing to alert security) ... "". You aked me for a source and I provided one here http://dw.de/p/1DB3P (David Dadic at ''Deutsche Welle''): ""The foreseeability test applies to eventualis, and not to culpable homicide"".
The court transcript is not available yet, so we must rely on the eNCA feed day 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V48R6dHwlmU and day 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSSBfM9y-m4. At 5:07 day 1 Masipa J commences considering culpable homicide and the question of negligence. She stresses that although the test is objective, there are subjective elements involved. We must consider the circumstances of the case from Pistorius's perspective (5:10). At 5:13 she first identifies details such as failing to alert security that Pistorius was negligent in. She then returns to the objective tests in law as they relate to the circumstances and asserts around 5:16 that he was negligent in not foreseeing the posibility that he might kill the person behind the door. However in the case of Reeva Steenkamp, the person Pistorius was charged with murdering, she had already ruled (dealing with ''individualis'') that he did not foresee she might be in the toilet. On day 2 around 1:02 she reprised her judgment on the first count in the same terms.

<user_id=128.90.93.207>
In your editor's copy the relevant citations say first: http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/12/world/africa/oscar-pistorius-verdict/ ""But in grabbing his gun and heading toward the supposed threat, Pistorius ""acted too hastily and used excessive force,"" Masipa ruled Thursday. His conduct was negligent ""and not what a reasonable man would do in the circumstances  not even a disabled one, she said."", and second: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29143540 Judge Thokozile Masipa said prosecutors had not proved he meant to kill his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, prompting tears from the Olympic sprinter. But she said he acted hastily and had been negligent. Mr Pistorius says he thought an intruder was in the toilet. Adjourning the trial, the judge said a reasonable person would not have fired."" Neither in fact says Pistorius was negligent in not foreseeing the possibility he would kill the person behind the door (the implication of your editor's copy), and in fact Masipa J had already ruled (dolus individualis) that Pistorius did not intend to kill the person behind the door.
I don't think you're right to assert Masipa J came to two different conclusions.

<user_id=128.90.93.207>
I hope this helps. I do think you ought to try and enlist the help of an expert here.

<user_id=Dynamic IP from Chicago>
I see that Wikipedia administrator  has protected the article from IP edits in line with Wikipedia's policy on biographies of living persons. I am not very familiar with Wikipedia policy and was not aware that one should open an account to edit on biographies of living persons. I have opened one now. I would be happy to assist with clearing up misconceptions in this article, of which I have noticed there are a number. Perhaps Mike V could help by confirming my account as I still can't edit the article until that takes place.

<user_id=Dynamic IP from Chicago>
Reviewing my copy, I think it worth making two further points. Firstly that Masipa J reserved the form of words ""clearly negligent"" for Pistorius's actions (in ot calling security etc.) and not his foresight. Secondly, what I did not notice at first, is that the editor is flat out wrong to assert ""One can be negligent without any foresight of killing someone, that would not amount to culpable homicide"". The test for culpable homicide is that one ought to have foreseen the possibility of killing someone (in, say, firing a gun), whereas if it were must have forseen then the case would go to murder. In her reprise on day 2, Masipa J explicitly warned against the tendency of advancing from ""ought"" to ""must"" (the basis of her emphasis on subjectivity).

<user_id=HelenOnline>
(ec) I am going to break my response down.
Several editors have worked on the article. I think copy edits by various editors have corrupted the meaning of the sentence. [Judge Masipa] ""said a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have and his actions were clearly negligent and culpable homicide thus a competent verdict"" became ""Judge Masipa said a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have foreseen this. In light of this, his actions were clearly negligent and culpable homicide was thus a competent verdict"". I agree that wording is misleading, as reasonable foresight and his negligent actions have been conflated.
We can use the eNCA videos for verbatim quotes but we may not interpret what the judge said, reliable sources must do that for us and there are enough.
The David Dadic article is essentially an opinion piece, and can therefore only be used to source his opinion. Dadic (who I have never even heard of and I have followed this trial closely on multiple local and international TV channels) has disagreed with the judge's interpretation of the law, in a somewhat different respect to other local legal experts I might add. We have to present the judge's actual reasoning in the verdict section, not what one legal expert thought it should have been. If there is a section on reactions or appeal, we can include the legal opinions of all the experts disputing the judge's interpretation of the law, with attribution, there. It does not belong in the verdict section.
The BBC source clearly supports two different conclusions by the judge (emphasis mine): ""'Clearly he did '''not''' subjectively foresee this as a possibility, that he would kill the person behind the door, let alone the deceased as he thought she was in the bedroom at the time.' .... 'Would a reasonable person in the same circumstances as the accused have foreseen the possibility that if he fired four shots whoever was behind the toilet might be struck and die as a result? She said the answer was '''yes'''. 'I am of the view that the accused acted too hastily and used excessive force. In the circumstances, it is clear that his conduct was negligent'""

<user_id=HelenOnline>
There are two aspects of reasonable foresight of killing someone the judge had to assess, the accused's subjective foresight which relates to a ''dolus eventualis'' verdict and the reasonable person's foresight which relates to a culpable homicide verdict. She came to different conclusions in each case, so clearly they are not the same thing. I think it is important to mention both. Sure, we can add other things the judge said in her verdict (e.g. Pistorius acted too hastily and used excessive force) but I don't think we should overwrite the foresight part. One can be negligent without any foresight of killing someone [i.e. neither the accused nor a reasonable person could have foreseen it], that would not amount to culpable homicide. Instead of discussing it on the article talk page like I asked them to, a dynamic IP from Chicago has decided to edit war over it instead ().

<user_id=HelenOnline>
I realised afterwards ""without any foresight"" could be misinterpreted. By that I meant neither the accused nor a reasonable person could have foreseen that someone would be killed. I have amended my post.

<user_id=HelenOnline>
Re your suggestion to enlist the help of an expert here, that is a very bad idea. They don't necessarily agree with the judge or each other for that matter and the last thing we need is a self-proclaimed expert pushing their POV here.

<user_id=HelenOnline>
If you are not familiar with Wikipedia policy, why are you in such a hurry to edit an article of such a serious nature? You can still help by commenting on the talk page, something you decided against when you thought edit warring on an article involving living people was a good idea.

<user_id=Dynamic IP from Chicago>
I understand that in fact it was you who requested the article be protected from IP edits.

<user_id=HelenOnline>
That is not a secret. What is your point?

<user_id=Dynamic IP from Chicago>
That in the circumstances I am not prepared to continue here.

<user_id=Dodger67>
'Comment on 's point 4 above'': The judge's finding that Pistorius did ""not subjectively foresee"" that he would kill the person behind the door, is the reason why he was found not guilty of murder. The judge's finding that ""a reasonable person"" could have foreseen that shooting through the door might cause the death of the person behind it, is the reason why he was found guilty of culpable homicide. AIUI, this is the core of the judge's reasoning for the verdict on the murder charge.

<user_id=Dynamic IP from Chicago>
I see that nevertheless you have made a substantial series of edits incorporating the objections I raised. Perhaps you could now ask adminsitrator  to unprotect the article.

<user_id=HelenOnline>
That is how WP:BRD works. I have considered your comments very carefully and made some changes I thought would help address valid issues you have raised. I am in no hurry to let anyone who doesn't understand Wikipedia rules loose on the article. By edit warring via a dynamic IP, you left me no choice as we cannot block a dynamic IP. I have no reason to believe you won't do it again. I have also had the Oscar Pistorius article re-protected, as there were BLP violations on both articles after the initial 48 hours semi-protection lapsed.

<user_id=Dynamic IP from Chicago>
Do what exactly again? Make an edit? Provide a citation? I made a sensible edit. You reverted it on the grounds it wan't sourced. I restored it with a source (not an 'opinion' piece incidentally but a ''Deutsche Welle'' interview with a noted SA litigation lawyer). You responded by asking administrator  to protect the page. This is what Wikipedia, the encyclopaedia anyone can edit, calls edit-warring? And to add insult to injury you then make a long series of verbose edits which essentially address what you concede are the valid issues I raised. I shall await the publication of the verdict and for sentencing and possible appeals to take their course, and then return with a closer edit on the verdict.

<user_id=HelenOnline>
I have explained the difference between edit warring and WP:BRD on your talk page and opened a RSN discussion about the source.

<user_id=HelenOnline>
Per the full judgement:
That however, is not the end of the matter, as culpable homicide is a competent verdict. I now deal with negligence in culpable homicide cases. In terms of Section 258 of the CPA, culpable homicide is a competent verdict to a charge of murder. In determining whether the accused was negligent in causing the death of the deceased, this court has to use the test of the reasonable man. In ''Burchell & Hunt'', Principles of Criminal Law, 4th Ed. the test to be applied to prove negligence is set out as follows:					False
1	2014-09-16 14:33:18	HelenOnline	'(a) Would a reasonable person in the same circumstances as the accused have foreseen the reasonable possibility of the occurrence of the consequence or the existence of the circumstance in question, including its unlawfulness.					False
1	2014-09-16 14:33:18	HelenOnline	(b) Would a reasonable person have taken steps to guard against that possibility and					False
1	2014-09-16 14:33:18	HelenOnline	(c) Did the accused fail to take the steps which he or she reasonably would have taken to guard against it.'					False
1	2014-09-16 14:33:18	HelenOnline	Only if these requirements above have been met, would the accused be guilty of negligence.

<user_id=Dynamic IP from Chicago>
Yes, but the point of my edit was that Judge Masipa did not say Pistorius was ""clearly"" negligent in not foreseeing that he might kill the person behind the door. Objectively he was negligent in not foreseeing that, but there were subjective elements to consider as well. I'm not sure, but I suspect Judge Masipa's dilemma was that having released Pistorius from the charge of common murder of Reeva Steenkamp because he genuinely did not foresee she might behind the door,  it then seems a stretch to convict him of her culpable homicide for not foreseeing he might kill her by shooting through the door. At any rate Judge Masipa was at pains to point out other aspects of his actions which were negligent, and it was these aspects she described as ""clearly"" negligent: ""I am of the view that the accused  acted too hasily and used excessive force. In the circumstances it is clear his conduct was negligent."" This distiction was carefully observed in the two sources your edit cited, nevertheless your editor felt justified to adjust the emphasis in the way they did, that Pisorius was ""clearly"" negligent in not foreseeing that he might kill the person behind the door - but that's not what Masipa J said.

<user_id=HelenOnline>
Sorry I don't get your point. I have already agreed with you that the wording was misleading as it had been corrupted by copy editing (see my point 1 above) and have addressed it in the article. That does not mean we should remove the part about reasonable foresight. His subjective foresight of killing someone and a reasonable person's are not the same thing and the different conclusions the judge reached about them are critical to her judgment.

<user_id=Dynamic IP from Chicago>
Indeed the wording was misleading, for whatever reason. My edit was intended to correct that. You reported me for edit-warring and then corrected it yourself in what were essentially the same terms, though rather verbose and poorly expressed in my opinion. I'm not really prepared to comment on the intracies of the verdict before all process is completed. I haven't seen an RS that affirms Judge Masipa reached different conclusions in respect of objective and subjective criteria, let alone aver that was critical to the judgment. Is that OR on your part, and is it guiding you in your editing here? What I have seen is criticism that Judge Masipa's verdict was too subjective, and in my remark above I suggest a possible dilemma she was facing. But as I understand it from you, these are just opinions which should be confined to a properly sourced ""Reaction"" session. On the face of it you don't appear to include your own opinions about the verdict in this dispensation.

<user_id=Dynamic IP from Chicago>
I have asked you elsewhere and I now ask you here. Are you prepared to offer me an apology for your behaviour to me, given that you concede, apparently after lengthy deliberation, that my edit was correct?

Meaning

<user_id=Florian Blaschke>
This article claims, right off the bat, that ''Aryan'' means ""noble"", without even citing a source for it. First, the ''English'' word ""Aryan"" does most definitely ''not'' mean ""noble"", so the claim as such is simply wrong. Second, the meaning of the word (the etymon, to put it more technically precisely) as attested in Indo-Iranian languages is neither clear nor uniform. Its philology is notoriously complicated and thorny, and there are many open questions. It seems to have originally been an endonym among the Iranians (with meanings like ""noble"" really being ''secondary''), whose derivation is completely obscure, while the meanings of formally similar terms in the earliest Sanskrit are varied and sometimes obscure and it's not even clear if and how they are related to the Iranian term (see Wiktionary for details). While the article later does cite three sources to the effect that the term means ""noble"", these sources are not technical sources written by cutting-edge researchers and experts but merely general reference works whose reliability and currency in such matters is often less than stellar. It may once have widely believed to have originally meant ""noble"", but contemporary researchers are much more cautious. As in Iranian, positive meanings like ""noble"" are thought to be ''secondary'' in Indo-Aryan, see wikt:आर्य#Sanskrit (where ""noble"" is not even mentioned; this meaning only seems to appear in Middle Indo-Aryan, apparently derived from the meaning ""a member of the first three castes"", which only attested later in Sanskrit and where an ethnic derivation suggests itself since the top three castes are the ones said to be correlated with the immigrant Indo-Aryans originally).

Rather then delete it outright, as you did, I restored it, but added a boiled-down version of what you wrote above, however with a ""citation needed"" tag.  Please provide a citation or citations back up your claim.

<user_id=Florian Blaschke>
That's not how it works. If you want an assertion into an article, especially as prominently, you need high-quality sources. The burden of proof cannot be shifted on whoever wishes to exclude a claim from the article.

<user_id=Florian Blaschke>
However, see Witzel (2016) (p. 3f.), who stresses that Old Indo-Aryan (Sanskrit) ''Ārya-'' (like Proto-Iranian ''*arya-'') is primarily a self-designation and the meaning ""noble"" appeared only in the post-Vedic, Middle Indo-Aryan period.

<user_id=Beyond My Ken>
The ""noble"" derivation is cited to the Oxford English Dictionary, which is a reasonably ""high quality"" source.  Your claim above sounds reasonable, which is why I included it in the lede, but it needs to be cited. If contemporary scholars are in agreement that it doesn't mean ""noble"", then you should have no trouble coming up with sources (Author, Title, Publisher, Page number, at the very least).  You do, after all, have an M.A. in Indo-European languages so, source it! NBD.

<user_id=Kautilya3>
I am in full agreement with Florian. These historical terms have had different meanings at different times. Dictionaries are not necessarily the best sources to get to the bottom of their meanings. Oxford English Dictionary, Encyclopedia Britannica and whole host of British sources still depend on colonial scholarship, which we don't consider to be reliable as per WP:HISTRS. The English meaning of Aryan has nothing to do with ""noble"". So it would be misleading to suggest that.

Please provide the sources which give the current understanding of the meaning of ""Aryan"".

<user_id=Kautilya3>
In which language?

For a comprehensive, if brief, coverage see the entry on FREEMAN in .

<user_id=Beyond My Ken>
Thank you for the cite.  (1) Do you have any citations which do not require that I take a trip to a research library in the middle of a particularly busy time for me, or (2) Could you please summarize what the citation says, perhaps with a brief except?  Thanks.

<user_id=Beyond My Ken>
The entry ""FREEMAN"" was written by the co-editor of the book, Professor Douglas Q. Adams of the Department of English, University of Idaho. He's an English professor who ""specializes in linguistics [and] is considered one of the world's utmost authorities on Tocharian, a “dead” language discovered at the turn of the 1900s. Adams co-edited ""The Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture"" in 1997, and is currently working on another Indo-European book project."" . So now we know that this specific scholar, an English professor, holds that ""Aryan"" means ""Freeman"" - all we need now is some evidence that this opinion is shared by the community of specialists in the specific subject matter.

<user_id=Kautilya3>
What, are you playing the good old game of disparaging sources? I thought you were one of the good guys! J. P. Mallory is an authority in Indo-European Studies. And Douglas Q. Adams has been described as an Indo-European comparativist.
The book is an encyclopedia explaining the meanings of ""Indo-European"" words, often reconstructed from the existing words in descendant languages (live or dead). The meaning of the root word has been explained as . And then the entry goes on to list the various words derived from it.
For Old Iranian ''aire'' the meaning was .
The Avestan ''airya-'' meant .
Old Indic ''ari-'' meant .
Old Indic ''arya-'' meant .
Then the say in the summary:  This ""in-group status"" is what is important for our purposes, which is exhibited in the second and fourth words above.

<user_id=Beyond My Ken>
I '''''am''''' ""one of the good guys"". It's simply that all I have to go by at this point are the OR statements of two editors and one source, none of which go to show that the information in the source is generally accepted.  Because I don't know the subject matter, I need to see a source which says, explicitly, something on the order of ""we thought it meant 'noble', but current scholarship believes it means 'freeman'"", which is the claim which I believe is being made.  If this is generally accepted, it should be easy to come up with that kind of citation, shouldn't it?

<user_id=Kautilya3>
There is no shortage of sources that tell you that Aryan meant the self-designation of the Vedic tribes when it was taken over into English by William Jones perhaps. The encyclopedia above tells you the history of the word ''before'' the Vedic tribes. The Indian meaning of ''arya'' as noble was ''after'' the Vedic tribes, in particular, after the tribal distinctions ceased to exist and the society was unified. This encyclopedia article explains the different evolutions of the word, even though it is not historically accurate (too much focus on ""Hindi"", whatever that means). Remember that throughout the 19th century, the idea was the ""Aryans"" invaded India. By that, they did not mean that ""noble people"" invaded India. The very thesis is laughable.

<user_id=Beyond My Ken>
You know better.  It is not sufficient to say ""there are no shortage of sources"", when asked to '''''YOu ahve to provide those sources.""  You can;t expect all Wikipedia editors to be masters of the subject of every article they work on, so if you are versed in it, you have the ability to find those sources and share them.

<user_id=Kautilya3>
I gave you a link to a Google Books search page. You can take the first one, which is good enough.
Honestly, I think you are wasting your time here. There is nothing contentious. You are merely trying to back some outrageous POV that somebody added.

<user_id=Beyond My Ken>
Actually, you're totally wrong.  I don't give a flying fig if it means ""noble"" or ""freeman"" or ""eucalyptus tree"", I am simply trying to uphold WP:V, which I'd advise you to read sometime if you're going to continue to edit here.  Oh, and WP:OR would be good to read as well, since you seem not to understand it.

<user_id=Gbohoadgwwian>
Arya means noble is accepted and supported in dictionary definition as well as scholarly sources, specifically in context of vedic literature. Aryan word is not more than a couple century old, and some scholarly article dispute various theories around it which lend the meaning of a 'race' to the word itself. Britannica has fairly established editing process. They conclude similarly.

<user_id=Kautilya3>
Is this page about the English word ""Aryan"", or Indian use of ""arya"" and Aryan, or both? What is your view? Why is, fo example, Aryan Books so called?

<user_id=Gbohoadgwwian>
I think this page is about Aryan. I think they wanted to convey ""Indology"" in ""Aryan"" word. Are you suggesting that Arya and Aryan are not ncecessarily related? I think that is possible, I do not know. But I find pre-vedic discussion of word Aryan counter-intuitive, if that word is newly coined then it is plausible that it was born independent of the word Arya, if we talk in the context of Vedic culture then it is more likely that the worn Aryan was associated with or same as Arya.

",0,"Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. **Argument about the meaning of ""Aryan""**: The initial argument by Florian Blaschke is that the term ""Aryan"" does not definitively mean ""noble"" and that the etymology and historical usage of the term are complex and varied. This is a strong argument because it is based on linguistic and historical analysis, and it challenges a simplistic interpretation of the term.

2. **Request for citations**: Beyond My Ken requests citations to support the claims made by Florian Blaschke. This is a reasonable request as it aligns with Wikipedia's verification policy, which requires that all content be verifiable and backed by reliable sources.

3. **Burden of proof**: Florian Blaschke argues that the burden of proof lies with those who wish to include the claim that ""Aryan"" means ""noble"". This is a valid point in the context of Wikipedia's content policies, where the inclusion of information requires adequate sourcing.

4. **Quality of sources**: Kautilya3 points out that dictionaries and colonial scholarship may not be the best sources for understanding historical terms, suggesting that the meaning of ""Aryan"" has evolved over time. This argument emphasizes the importance of using contemporary and scholarly sources for historical terms.

5. **Scholarly consensus**: Beyond My Ken seeks evidence of a scholarly consensus on the meaning of ""Aryan"". This is a strong approach as it seeks to establish what the majority of experts in the field believe, rather than relying on a single source or opinion.

6. **Historical context**: Kautilya3 provides historical context for the meaning of ""Aryan"", explaining its evolution from a self-designation to a term with various meanings in different languages. This adds depth to the discussion by showing the complexity of the term's history.

7. **Verification and original research**: Beyond My Ken insists on adherence to Wikipedia's policies on verification and original research, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the encyclopedia.

8. **Divergence of meanings**: Gbohoadgwwian introduces the idea that ""Aryan"" as a term might have diverged in meaning from its original context, which is a relevant point in the discussion about the term's etymology and usage.

Overall, the discussion involves a mix of strong arguments that emphasize the need for reliable sourcing, scholarly consensus, and historical context. There is a clear effort to adhere to Wikipedia's content policies, and the participants are actively engaging in a debate to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information. However, there is also some tension and disagreement on the interpretation of sources and the burden of proof, which is typical in discussions about controversial topics.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.5",7.5

User:Faizan insists on adding ""Afghan militants"" in the infobox but the sources (Pakistani news reports) do not even mention any Afghan militant group.   Second, the United States is not involved in this operation. Finally, the subject of this article should only be the operation. Can we not fill this article with personal views of Pakistani news editors regarding Afghan politicians.

<user_id=Krzyhorse22>
Unsourced POV pushing

<user_id=Faizan>
I will not re add this news about non-cooperation of Afghanistan, However I am looking for more references. Whether the ""Haqqani Network"" is Afghan or not, the provided reference clearly states that the operation is against Haqqani Network too. Agreed about the non-involvement of US. Now, regarding the use of Afghan Militants, the references provided clearly state that the militants were attacking from across the Afghan border.
From this one: ""a group of terrorists crossed over from Afghanistan and attacked the Dandi Kuch post in Spinwam area of North Waziristan."" From that one: ""70 to 80 militants attacked the check post in the cross-border attack at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.""
I hope this solves the confusion.

<user_id=Saadkhan12345>
I agree...sources do not mention afghan militias...they could be pakistani or uzbek or irani...we know fazlulah of tehreek e taliban is hiding in afghanistan..militias attacking paki ...seems like his job...but CIA drones are involved in operation zarb-e-azb...i think what krzyhorse22 is trying to say is tht it hasnt been officially announced but thy are playing a big role here.

<user_id=Faizan>
Well obviously the militants attacking from inside of Afghanistan are ""Afghan militants"". Even the arab, central asian, Pakistani militants operating inside Pakistan are referred to as ""Pakistani"". The main concerned thing is the ""Area of Operations"". Haqqani Network also has operations both inside Pak and Afg. The term ""Terrorists from Afghanistan"" used by the above source clarifies this.

2	2014-11-03 17:39:45	Faizan	The source says MILITANTS FROM AFGHANISTAN"" and ""MILITANTS FROM ACROSS THE BORDER"", which just implies that it is talking about ""Afghan Militants"".

<user_id=Krzyhorse22>
The basic rule is that we only put verifiable information, no opinions, speculations or implying. There has never been any Afghan militant group fighting against Pakistan. Why would they? They are only against NATO presence inside Afghanistan and that's their reason for fighting in that country. These militants all belong to a group, there are no lone wolf militants. Faizan, ""militants from Afghanistan"" only has one meaning, and is not a reference to Afghans. It is referring to the listed militants who sometimes hide in mountains of Afghanistan and sometimes in Pakistan, they should not be labelled Afghans. The term ""Afghan"" refers to a citizen of Afghanistan. We should avoid listing the wrong people.

<user_id=Krzyhorse22>
Regarding the Haqqani network, it has 4000-15000 members. All we know is that the founder and a few top leaders were born in Afghanistan. We need to verify if this group is actually involved or not. Not long ago this is what top US officials told the media, ""There is evidence linking the Haqqani Network to the Pakistan government.""  I'm not saying Pakistan is not fighting with this group but we need a reliable source to prove it. This Pakistani news report  is only addressing that Afghanistan helps catch leader of TTP, Fazlullah, which is a different group from Haqqani.

<user_id=TheSawTooth>
I move to dispute your revision because they are Afghan militants if the reference is saying that they are from that country. You can not defend your country on Wikipedia you have to go and take real action if a fact like this is upsetting you. Wikipedia is only trying to report journalism.

<user_id=Saadkhan12345>
first of all you removed CIA DRONE from the article...Im assuming you dont know shit about operation. If you scroll down theres a whole section on drone strikes taking out more than 50 militants. Secondly, im not from afghanistan...Im from pakistan. Third...theres a difference between '''AFGHAN militants''' and '''MILITANTS from Afghanistan'''. last but not least Operation Zarb-e-azb is based in North Waziristan District......as for the cross border attacks they are not Part of the operation...The main mission of the operation is clearing out north waziristan...quote  ""against foreign and local terrorists who were hiding in sanctuaries in North Waziristan tribal region.""(http://www.dawn.com/news/1112909/pakistan-launches-zarb-e-azb-military-operation-in-n-waziristan)  '''just because theres something with sources doesnt mean its part of the article.'''

<user_id=Faizan>
I said it before that it does not matter that the Haqqanis are Pakistanis or Afghan or Uzbeks. All that matters is that the Pakistani security officials have declared that the operation is also against them. And so, Haqqani Network would be included in the infobox. Secondly, according to the reliable sources given above in the ""Extended Content"", the intruders attack Pakistan from ""across the border"". Across the border simply means that it is the Afghans. The wording used by the source is exactly ""Militants from Afghanistan"", so this is undisputable.

<user_id=Faizan>
Nah... Even killing of terrorists in Khyber Agency is reported under the heading of Zarb-e-Azb. Yes, as the forces which are stationed for the Operation Zarb-e-Azb are attacked by Afghan terrorists, the counter attack simply makes it a part of the Operation. Regards.

<user_id=Faizan>
Mr. , please refrain from personal attacks and harassment. You are trying to blame and harass entire Pakistanis, please do not mock to ownership of articles and try to get consensus for your non-popular uni-lateral nationalistic changes. And I don't want to discuss the merits of Afghanistan here.

<user_id=Krzyhorse22>
Personal attacks and harassment? Every knowledgeable person about this region (Afghanistan-Pakistan-India) agrees with my statement. It is recommended that people with knowledge edit this article. You called Afghans terrorists in your statement but we never seen terrorist attacks done by Afghans inside Pakistan. Therefore, you're the one with the problem. I didn't even edit this stinky article since November 2, so regarding ownership of articles, what are you talking about? The discussion here is not about Afghanistan, it's you wrongly adding ""Afghan militants"" in the infobox due to your personal feeling and using the old falsification of sources method, which is blockable if you keep repeating it regardless how long you've been editing Wikipedia. Accept the fact that Pakistani terrorists are killing Pakistani citizens  and that Pakistan's government started this operation against them (and the few foreigners that may be with them). Most of us editors don't give a rats ass about Pakistani, Afghan, Indian, American, or our own nationality, we only come here to improve articles based on WP:NPOV and WP:ACCURACY. I say that because in Wikipedia there is no nationality, we could claim to be a citizen of any country.

<user_id=Krzyhorse22>
Faizan is POV pushing and this is simply unacceptable. He's engaged in the blame game. Like most Pakistanis, he rejects the idea that Pakistan itself is known globally as a major terrorist training ground. I mean look at every terrorist attack that was carried out in USA and the UK, they all involved Pakistani terrorists. Instead, he wants to portray Pakistan as a peace loving and civilized country such as USA that is being attacked by Afghans. This sort of thinking is just weird and un-comprehensible to any person of ordinary intelligence. In other words, he's trying to falsify well established fact. Some Afghans are possibly enrolled in the listed groups but that's something to address in the articles of those groups. Why specifically list Afghans and not Arabs, Uzbeks from Uzebkistan, Chechens, Tajikistanis, and the so many others? I think we all know, based on news reports, that Pakistanis hate Afghans and Indians but Wikipedia is not the place for this. We need to interpret the sources accurately, without exaggerating or adding personal opinions. Anyway, the Pentagon in Washington, DC, as well as Afghanistan's government and others, have been claiming for the last decade or so that Pakistan is using certain militant groups (i.e. Haqqani network) to carry out attacks inside Afghanistan in order to weaken the Afghan state and NATO forces.  There are countless RSs to support these claims. However, Pakistan always denies it. So this is the complicated issue here. Do we trust what NATO leaders say or do we trust Pakistanis?

<user_id=Saadkhan12345>
I have removed my own View which was ('''CIA drone strikes''' should be added in belligerents) ...User:TheSawTooth and User:Faizan view that ""'''afghan militant'''"" should added in belligerents. I think we should resolves the dispute here first and thn make an edit regardiing this.

<user_id=Saadkhan12345>
i think afghan militants should be changed to militant because theres a difference between ""Afghan militants"" and ""militants from Afghanistan...Like the uzbek militants based in pakistan are known as Uzbek militants not pakistani militants ...according to user:Faizan and User:TheSawTooth uzebk militants based in pakistan should be called Pakistani militants but thats not how they are refereed to in Dawn.com newspaper articles.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

I do not have any view on CIA drones. That tag was removed because you always add one more tag in same edit. That is not compromise.

",1,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The main point of contention in the discussion is whether to label certain militants as ""Afghan militants"" in the infobox of a Wikipedia article. User Krzyhorse22 argues that the sources do not mention any Afghan militant group and that the term ""Afghan militants"" should not be used without proper sourcing. This argument is based on the principle of verifiability and avoiding original research, which are core Wikipedia policies.

2. User Faizan counters by saying that the sources do mention ""militants from Afghanistan"" and insists that this implies they are ""Afghan militants."" Faizan's argument is based on the interpretation of the sources, but it seems to lack a clear distinction between nationality and the location from which militants may operate.

3. User Saadkhan12345 brings up the point that militants attacking from Afghanistan could be of various nationalities and that the term ""Afghan militants"" might be misleading. This argument supports the need for precision and clarity in Wikipedia articles.

4. User TheSawTooth argues that if the reference says militants are from Afghanistan, they should be labeled as Afghan militants. This argument seems to conflate the location of militant activity with the nationality of the militants, which is a point of contention in the discussion.

5. Krzyhorse22 also raises the issue of neutrality and the potential for nationalistic bias to influence the content of the article. This is an important consideration in maintaining Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.

6. Throughout the discussion, there are instances of personal attacks and accusations of nationalistic bias, which detract from the overall quality of the argumentation. Wikipedia discussions should focus on content and policy, not on the contributors themselves.

7. The discussion also touches on the complexity of the situation in the region and the difficulty of accurately representing the involvement of various groups and states in the conflict. This complexity is a challenge for the editors, who must navigate conflicting sources and perspectives.

Overall, the discussion shows an engagement with Wikipedia policies and a struggle to interpret sources accurately. However, the quality of the arguments is undermined by occasional personal attacks, conflations of nationality with the location of activity, and a lack of consensus on how to apply Wikipedia's verifiability and neutrality standards to the specific case at hand.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 5.5",5.5
"<user_id=Neil S Walker>
Simple question: Is there a reliable source that categorically states Kivelidi was poisoned with a Novichok agent?

<user_id=Neil S Walker>
Arbitrary break

<user_id=Meodipt>
In this interview with BBC Russia , Mirzayanov states that it was Substance 33 (VR (nerve agent)) that was used to poison Kivelidi. So another nerve agent developed in the same lab under the Foliant program, but not one of the novel A-xxx agents referred to as Novichok.

<user_id=Neil S Walker>
Well spotted. He says ""Это как раз то, что случилось при отравлении Кивелиди, помните? Для его убийства было использовано '''вещество-33'''"" (''This is exactly what happened when Kivelidi was poisoned, remember? Substance 33 was used to kill him'')

<user_id=My very best wishes>
There are many source which claim or suggest it (see here. I just included that one.

<user_id=Neil S Walker>
Regardless of what others speculate about, Mirzayanov states clearly that it was Substance 33/VR - ''not'' a Novichok agent.

<user_id=My very best wishes>
First of all, what are your references (with pages)? You did not answer this question. Even if there are RS telling that the compound used to poison Kivelidi was ""Substance 33"", that content still belongs to this page for three reasons: a) The substance 33 is in fact ""Novichok"" compound according to this (see citation below), (b) there is a significant number of other RS telling it was Novichok:

<user_id=Neil S Walker>
Sources for what? Mirzayanov stating that VR was used to kill Kivelidi— Zabarin—. There are no reliable sources stating that it was Novichok. You are linking sources that state only that it was a nerve agent. VR ''is'' a nerve agent. It thus belongs on the VR article '''not''' the Novichok article. Don't ask for sources - I have provided a source (Mirzayanov, above) confirming it was Substance 33, while all you are doing is providing sources that speculate or just say ""nerve agent"". I'm well aware of what you are trying to do here, introducing dubious misinformation and speculation to muddy the waters. You have not refuted Mirzayanov's reliability, his close knowledge of the Foliant program and Substance 33, and you are conflating VR - a different agent ''with its own article'' - with the Novichok agents. Tucker above is quite clearly being misquoted or is simply wrong: ""the first binary formulation developed under Foliant was used to make Substance 33"" is nonsense because Substance 33 is a ''unitary'' agent and was developed by 1963. Substance 33 is not a Novichok agent - it is VR! The reason they are called ""novichok"" is because they are the new generation ''after'' the ''V'' agents!

<user_id=My very best wishes>
Thank you. I will check this BBC (in Russian) source (second one is a WP link). No, I just quoted above a publication in Chemical and Engineering News which tells the Substance-33 was the first version of Novichok.

<user_id=My very best wishes>
Now, I checked your source , and here is what Mirzayanov said about Kievilidi: ""Для его убийства было использовано вещество-33, так, по крайней мере, говорилось в то время, дескать использовался ""Новичок"""" Hence he is saying that substance 33 was indeed version of Novichok. Same as Tucker. There is no contradiction.

<user_id=Meodipt>
Just as an aside, the ru.wiki page on the poisoning of the Skripals claims that a Novichok agent was also used to assassinate the Chechen militant leader Ibn al-Khattab in 2002  though the source they cite doesn't seem to say this.  May be another relevant incident though.

<user_id=My very best wishes>
I think we are coming to the following conclusion. This is a series of compounds. All compounds in the Table on the top (binary or not) should be mentioned on this page and relevant to this page because: (a) they are closely related to the development and disclosure of Novichok, and (b) they were frequently named in multiple sourced simply as ""Novichok"". Even Mirzayanov tells here something like ""substance 33 aka ""Novichok"" (""Для его убийства было использовано вещество-33, так, по крайней мере, говорилось в то время, дескать использовался ""Новичок"". ""). But we can also have sub-pages for specific compounds, as we have it right now for the substance-33.

<user_id=My very best wishes>
As about Khattab, - who knows?, but I am thinking about Moscow hostage crisis chemical agent. That was quite obviously not an opioid, but a nerve agent, possibly in a mixture with something and at a low dose. All signs are there: the high mortality rate, the long-term significant health damage for victims, people stopped breathing, and the operation had to be personally approved by Putin as he recently admitted.

<user_id=Meodipt>
I think we can be fairly sure the Moscow Theatre agent was an opioid, forensic analysis of clothes and urine of survivors found carfentanil, remifentanil and halothane. Besides the symptoms do not match nerve agent, true both opioid and nerve agent toxicity cause miosis, vomiting and cessation of breathing, but nerve agents also characteristically produce violent convulsions and production of mucus, which were not evident in victims from that incident. Khattab seems more likely, it is acknowledged that he was poisoned with an unknown nerve agent, and by some accounts with a delayed onset then sudden emergence of effects, like what was seen with the Skripals. But given the circumstances of Khattab's death it seems unlikely the truth will ever be known.   But
Yes, they found what they found , but no one can guarantee they found everything. People who survived became handicaps for life. Here is one of publications on this. According to another RS, 40 people died during six months after the application of the agent. Does it look like an effect of opioid drugs? Moreover, witnesses claimed it was gas, not aerosol.

<user_id=Meodipt>
Note that Russian article from yesterday includes what purports to be evidence from the trial showing the compound that killed Kivelidi to be the F > OEt analogue of GV, not Substance 33. So that would presumably make it a Novichok (or Foliant compound of some sort anyway)

",0,"Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. The discussion begins with a user, Neil S Walker, asking for a reliable source that categorically states Kivelidi was poisoned with a Novichok agent.

2. Meodipt responds by referencing an interview with Mirzayanov, who states that it was Substance 33 (VR nerve agent) that was used to poison Kivelidi, not a Novichok agent.

3. Neil S Walker confirms the statement from Mirzayanov and argues that since it was Substance 33, it should not be associated with Novichok agents in the article.

4. My very best wishes challenges this by citing sources that suggest Substance 33 is a Novichok compound and argues that it should be included in the Novichok article.

5. Neil S Walker refutes this by emphasizing the distinction between VR and Novichok agents, pointing out that VR is a unitary agent developed earlier than Novichok agents.

6. My very best wishes then checks the source provided by Neil S Walker and interprets Mirzayanov's statement as saying that Substance 33 was indeed a version of Novichok, aligning with Tucker's statement.

7. Meodipt brings up another incident involving a Novichok agent, but My very best wishes shifts the discussion to speculate about the Moscow hostage crisis chemical agent.

8. Meodipt argues that the Moscow Theatre agent was likely an opioid based on forensic analysis, while My very best wishes suggests it could have been a nerve agent due to the long-term health damage and high mortality rate.

9. The discussion ends with Meodipt noting that recent evidence from a trial suggests the compound that killed Kivelidi could be a Novichok or Foliant compound.

The quality of the arguments varies throughout the discussion. Initially, the arguments are fact-based and focused on the distinction between VR and Novichok agents. However, as the discussion progresses, some arguments become speculative, particularly regarding the Moscow hostage crisis chemical agent. The participants provide sources and engage in a back-and-forth that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, but there is some confusion and disagreement about the classification of the substances involved.

Overall, the discussion is detailed and shows a good level of engagement and sourcing, but the speculative nature of some arguments and the lack of consensus on the classification of the substances slightly diminish the quality of the discussion.

Thus, the quality score of the discussion is: 7.0",7.0
