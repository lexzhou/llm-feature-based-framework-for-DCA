# Analyzing constructive conversations

This is a reimplementation of the features from our paper,

> Conversational markers of constructive discussions. Vlad Niculae and
Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil. In: Proc. of NAACL 2016.
https://vene.ro/constructive/

See the `test` functions in `msg_features.py` and `turn_features.py` for
usage examples.

*Note.* For clarity and reusability, the code has been simplified, notably in terms
of normalization, compared to what we used in the paper, so results may slightly vary.
If you require the original feature values from our dataset, and more details about
them, don't hesitate to contact us.
