Also we should question the political knowledge of the mass public and whether they were informed enough to make such a decision. I am not of the opinion that Brexit is inherently wrong and even if it does take 50 years for the UK to eventually benefit, is it worth the 50 years of suffering? Also a lot can change in 50 years that cannot be politically predicted and perhaps this decision will continue to prove fruitless.",

I think people should do what feels or seems good for them instead of judging one another of their choices. If you want to be vegan go ahead, that is good for your and if you want to be an omnivore go ahead that is also good for you. If we based this on \"moral standards\" then both types of people should not eat neither of their preferred types of food and should go hungry but that does not seem realistic at all.  ",

The Trade and Cooperation Agreement agreed in December changes the basis of our relationship with our European neighbours from EU law to free trade and friendly cooperation. As a consequence of the UK leaving the Single Market and Customs Union, the way businesses in Great Britain trade goods with the EU has changed. To export goods to the EU your business now needs to comply with new customs procedures, including UK export declarations and import requirements on entry to EU Member States. For importing goods into the UK, border controls are being introduced in stages to give businesses time to adapt, with full customs checks applying from January 2022. Businesses are to increase prices of products thus prices for certain goods and services are to hike as well. It might not affect all but the poor will be disadvantaged.",
